<batch_sep> <sep> the importance of punctuation and literacy in grammar <sep><sep> between traditional literacy and modern literacy <sep><sep> grammar is often seen as something complex that tires the mind that is learned in school that is good for those who enjoy reading and writing or for those who need to do it <sep><sep> it is good for school children it is good for language teachers for intellectuals for writers and so on <sep><sep> but it is not necessary to know how to read or learn it to have regular conversations <sep><sep> there are also people who think that only languages that have grammar are valid <sep><sep> which languages are mainly used for conversation like most creole languages that have been used until they do not have grammar <sep><sep> a question that often returns here is how a language where everyone speaks their way of pronouncing words in their way of writing when the occasion arises in personal and different graphic codes as languages can have their own grammar in fact most people don't know exactly what grammar means <sep><sep> in reality there is a lot of confusion about the meaning of grammar and it is this confusion that is responsible for many misinterpretations and misrepresentations that people have about the notion of grammar <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is the reason why it is necessary to start our reflection on Mauritian Creole grammar by questioning the different meanings that the term "grammar" has had until now. <sep><sep> The origin of the term "grammar" comes from my Greek grammar which means the rule that allows people to read and write as needed. <sep><sep> Even though there were different systems from the origin of writing in our time in the West where people were taught how to write, it was the Greeks who first developed a consciousness of what grammar meant in a sense that we understand it in modern times with classification of words into categories, description of rules for sentence construction, conjugation of verbs, etc. <sep><sep> They did it for a very good reason, which was related to the preservation of the Greek language such as it was practiced in ancient times, especially in the time of Homer who the Greeks consider as the first poet that Europe has known. <sep><sep> The Greeks have always considered that period as the golden age of the Greek language. <sep><sep> But towards the end of the Greek empire, authorities considered that the level of their language was beginning to decline and lose its value due to the practices of younger generations and contamination by other languages. <sep><sep> It became necessary to describe and write down the rules that would allow younger generations to know how to speak and write correctly when using the Greek language. <sep><sep> It was the ancient texts written in classical times that served as a reference for the description of the language and provided rules for how to use it in a correct manner. <sep><sep> The term "grammar" appeared in French from the 8th century where it began to take on different meanings depending on the function of the linguistic system, thought or theory that people chose to adopt. <sep><sep> From that moment on, the definition of "grammar" was no longer limited to reading and writing but also concerned speech. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> for arnauld and lancelot the grammar of port royal was the synonym of the art of speaking <sep><sep> in the dictionary of the academy defines grammar as the art of speaking and describing correctly <sep><sep> this definition has been taken up by many dictionaries since that time <sep><sep> for example, the littré dictionary tells us that grammar is the art of expressing one's thoughts through speech or writing in a manner that conforms to the rules established by good usage, while le grand robert tells us that it is the set of rules to follow in order to speak and write correctly in a language <sep><sep> in general, this phrase has been transmitted from one generation to another in school and it is also this phrase that has been used to describe what is called traditional grammar in creole <sep><sep> traditional grammar, when talking about traditional grammar in general is making reference to a type of grammar that has three main characteristics <sep><sep> it is a normative grammar, by normative we mean that traditional grammar makes a distinction between good ways to write and speak a language and ways that are not correct <sep><sep> it imposes rules without taking into account the evolution of language, the diversity of practices and the variations in its usage in real life <sep><sep> schools are privileged places where normative grammar is learned with the support of books and reference texts <sep><sep> it gives more importance to writing than speaking, traditional grammar focuses on writing and not speaking as the basis for describing the rules of a language <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even if speech is used to say that the best way to communicate is through writing, which becomes his first point of reference. <sep><sep> Language in itself is considered a field of family expression where there are many variations and improvisations as language requires fixed rules recognized by the community or by academic, scientific, or political authorities. <sep><sep> This is why in most cases traditional grammar takes examples from the texts of great writers. <sep><sep> It gives more importance to morphology than syntax, and the explanation of traditional grammar is inspired by the heritage that has been passed down from ancient Greek and Latin times where more importance was given to morphology in the study of the form and formation of words rather than syntax which focused on the place and function of words in a sentence. <sep><sep> Words, phrases, and the importance of morphology for Greek and Latin grammar are linked to the strictness of these two languages. <sep><sep> Both are synthetic languages, whereas modern languages are rather analytical where syntax plays a more important role than morphology. <sep><sep> Morpheme by morpheme, we understand the study of form and formation of words, that is to say the distinction between nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. <sep><sep> The way they form changes in gender, singular, plural, the way they form new words based on prefixes, suffixes, compounds, etc. <sep><sep> Syntax by syntax, we understand the study of the function and arrangement of words in a sentence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, we need to start by specifying that modern grammar does not make reference to a single grammar but to several <sep><sep> We call them modern because they have appeared after traditional grammar and have been defined mostly in comparison with traditional grammar <sep><sep> Among the grammars that fall into the category of modern grammar, we have strictural grammars, also known as structural grammars, all inspired by structural linguistics <sep><sep> In this category, we find mainly two major tendencies: distributional grammar like Bloomfield, Harris, and Hockett's transformational and generative grammar, which is an extension of distributional grammar <sep><sep> There are also other terms used to refer to these grammars such as formal grammar, syntagmatic grammar, syntactic grammar, etc <sep><sep> Moreover, what is common to all these grammars is that they study grammar starting from the form and structure of sentences that exist in the language they are describing, analyzing words based on the positions and roles they have in those sentences in the most detailed way possible <sep><sep> Secondly, the language-based grammars are especially interested in communication; they highlight the actions that individuals seek to accomplish when they address one another, such as greetings, thanks, requesting information, providing information, giving orders, intimidation, etc. <sep><sep> For each of these actions, there are syntactic or stylistic categories that should correspond to each other, and which the speakers of a language need to know and master in order to communicate <sep><sep> Language-based grammars are particularly interested in the identification and analysis of these categories <sep><sep> Among the grammars that fall into the category of language-based grammar, we find enunciation grammar, discourse grammar, and language act grammar <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Grammar text is a prolongation of strict grammar which concerns itself with the study of sentences and the grammar that describes and structures language in communication situations where they occur <sep><sep> It highlights the criteria and strictures that determine the coherence of a text <sep><sep> Linguistic terms are used in enunciation to design an oral or written message that occurs in a communication situation <sep><sep> Modern grammar, compared to traditional grammar, details the first grammar that distanced itself from traditional grammar, showing the characteristics that differentiate them <sep><sep> Structural grammar characteristics are more descriptive than normative, whereas traditional grammar is normative and focused more on modern grammars inspired by approaches of objectivity and scientific linguistics that have advanced, adopting an approach that aligns more with describing real language practices over those imposed by theoreticians <sep><sep> They do not believe there are superior practices compared to others <sep><sep> They only note there are different language practices in society and describe these different practices in relation to situations and contexts in which they thrive <sep><sep> This is why speech often takes precedence over writing in modern grammar <sep><sep> They place more importance on speech than writing since in any natural language the production of language is infinitely higher in oral than in written formats, except for languages that have died out but are still studied for various reasons <sep><sep> Modern grammar is fundamentally based on its analysis of oral practices rather than its written practices <sep><sep> This characteristic is even more evident in Creole languages than in modern languages, which have functioned predominantly as oral languages to this day <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> furthermore, their analysis takes into consideration the context of utilization <sep><sep> they agree that syntax is of greater importance than morphology, especially in strict grammar and spoken language situations. While traditional grammar, inspired mainly by classical languages such as Greek and Latin, has always given more importance to morphology than to syntax, modern linguistics, studying mainly modern languages, tend to consider syntax as playing a greater role in understanding the grammar of a language than morphology. <sep><sep> they consider that the phrases people use are often preferred over forms and naturalistic functions in themselves, which gives them their importance. <sep><sep> for example, a word that is an adjective in its morphology can easily be used as a noun or an adverb in a sentence. <sep><sep> if we take the word "dur" as an example, it is an adjective in its grammatical category, ex. "un travail dur une fille dure", but in the examples "c'est un dur" or "elle travaille dur", "dur" is used as a noun and an adverb respectively. <sep><sep> morphology does not allow this dimension to be taken into account, whereas syntax allows it. <sep><sep> in creole languages, where there is even more elasticity, words can change categories in a freer way than in French and other languages with stricter structures. <sep><sep> this is why a syntactic approach is often more efficient in identifying grammatical categories of words rather than morphology. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> but in the case of Creole languages, and more specifically Mauritian Creole, the morphology of it also holds great importance when we study the formation processes and creations of the words that are  <sep><sep> after all that we have found, we think that there are several ways to define grammar depending on the context we are in and on which aspect we want to give more importance <sep><sep> summary on grammar definitions <sep><sep> in a quick operational approach it is possible to define grammar like scientific studies strictly in a language <sep><sep> but there are also other definitions worth mentioning in the exercises we are doing here <sep><sep> a grammar refers to a set of rules that allow for combining linguistic units present in a language and allowing to form sentences that people use when expressing themselves through statements <sep><sep> all languages have a grammar otherwise people would not be able to use them to communicate <sep><sep> grammar also means a description and a way to locate the strict structure of a language according to a specific theory and propose a way to analyze it and its functioning according to these theories <sep><sep> there is a traditional way to analyze the grammar of a language, a more modern structural method <sep><sep> but there are also other approaches such as spoken grammar among transformational grammar, text grammar etc <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Modern grammarians tend to study languages in a more descriptive and objective way, while traditional grammarians tend to be more prescriptive and normative <sep>
<sep> In school settings where students may be taught grammar in one or multiple languages at the same time, normative and prescriptive approaches often prevail <sep>
<sep> The concept of grammar mistakes is used in this context either because an analysis of a sentence was done poorly or because the sentence was written or spoken in a way that doesn't conform to the rules of the language <sep>
<sep> In school settings, we often preserve a grammar in the form of a manual where descriptive or prescriptive rules of a language are written and described with exercises for students to practice <sep>
<sep> Studies on Strict Mauritian Creole grammar and linguistic studies on Mauritian Creole have been carried out according to various linguistic perspectives: phonetic, lexicological, syntactic, sociolinguistic, etc. <sep>
<sep> They represent a very small percentage compared to the total number of studies done on the languages of Mauritius, yet they are over-represented given the situation of multilingualism and French in the country, which are always studied according to their own criteria <sep>
<sep> Analyses of Strict Mauritian Creole date back to the publication of "Étude Sur Le Patois Créole De Maurice" by Baissac <sep>
<sep> However, Baissac adopted a traditional approach influenced by colonial ideology at that time, not considering Creole as a legitimate language but rather as a subject of amusement or a common object of international scientific study <sep>
<sep> Nevertheless, Baissac's publication remains a reference due to the interest it represents in analyzing Strict Mauritian Creole as it was and still is <sep>
<sep> A diachronic perspective shows that studies on Mauritian Creole as a language in its own right begin with the development of modern linguistic research, starting with the publication of "Cours De Linguistique Générale" <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This publication is made by students starting from the time their professor died in Ferdinand de Saussure <sep><sep> through his university courses, Saussure has brought decisive changes in the perspective analysis and definition of a language <sep><sep> In fact, through his work, Saussure has valued a synchronic perspective whereas before him, philologists, individuals who study a language from ancient texts, were giving priority in their analysis of language evolution and genealogy <sep><sep> The perspective that Saussure has adopted has allowed him to primarily highlight the evidence of the multiplicity of variations that can exist in the practice of a language within a community so these variations are based on a limited number of linguistic signs <sep><sep> these signs are part of a network of relationships that organize them into a strict system <sep><sep> it's like what Saussure defines as a language as a sign system and that he gave birth to through his structural linguistic work <sep><sep> Linguists around the world are increasingly showing interest in Creole languages primarily because of certain common characteristics that these languages present such as their strict structuring and exceptional location that make them subject to studies on the context of their origin, their location, and the period when they emerged <sep><sep> They have found that the strict structuring characteristics of Creole languages are explained by the commonalities between the contexts of their origin. Creole languages are generally found on islands or in cases like Louisiana, Guinea-Bissau and Guyana in societies with plantations of sugarcane, coffee, or cotton <sep><sep> while the first questions to ask about the linguistic nature of Creole languages are whether there is a single Creole language or if they are pidgin languages, dialects, or patois. There are three main theories that will emerge after this first clarification <sep><sep> it is important to know that among these three main theories, they are mainly based on the example of Creole languages in the Indian Ocean, specifically Mauritian and Seychellois Creole. The first theory leans towards the influence of European languages on the construction of Creole languages, a phenomenon that linguists call Eurocentrism <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Chaudenson represents this current the best <sep><sep> for him, the Creoles have formed through a poor acquisition of French with its own term being an approximation of an approximation  <sep><sep> there are stages in his theory that explains the first that it is a habitation society where slaves and their masters live together in the same residence and secondly in a plantation society where slaves will come in large numbers and they will live in sugar cane fields where they will not have direct contact with their masters <sep><sep> it is interesting to note that Chaudenson developed his theory from his analysis of Reunion Creole and mostly Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> and a second theory revolves around the influences of the languages of the slaves mainly African have had on the construction of Creole languages that the linguists refer to as this Afrocentric theory <sep><sep> here we will be able to present Manessy and Baker who think Creoles have formed from African languages or because of demographic reasons primarily concerning Hall Hymes Ferguson Debose Valdman Chaudenson <sep><sep> slaves <sep><sep> Baker also developed his theory from the example of Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> a third theory is influenced mainly by the work of Chomsky who thinks that anyone has in his brain all what is necessary to communicate when he is born <sep><sep> we know his theory as Universal Grammar and Bickerton represents in his theory a bio-program to explain the development of Creole languages that linguists refer to as this innate theory <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bickerton will develop his theory based on the example of Creole languages <sep> <sep> We must recognize that the evolution of European linguistic theories has influenced the development of analytical perspectives on an international level <sep> <sep> The recognition of Creole languages as full-fledged languages is primarily a result of the insights that linguists have brought according to a structural perspective <sep> <sep> But this recognition is limited to scientific circles, as it has been known and is still encountering much resistance among non-specialists <sep> <sep> The first studies that recognize Mauritian Creole as a language in bibliography, such as Oceanic Linguistics Special Publications, were the first publications on the strict Mauritian Creole perspective in modern linguistics, going back to the articles of Urruty for the mainstream public appearing in the Guadeloupéenne Dec Revue <sep> <sep> According to the same bibliography, one should expect to see more specialized studies on the strict Mauritian Creole perspective, such as the dissertation deposited by Kiamtia "An analysis of the Mauritian Creole Patois at the University of Wales in <sep> <sep> Through his study, Kiamtia demonstrates that Mauritian Creole is a language different from French <sep> <sep> Other publications are seen as descriptions that the British have made for foreigners visiting or working in Mauritius <sep> <sep> The article by Richardson appearing in the Journal of African Languages makes a comparative analysis of the characteristics of Mauritian Creole with French, Malagasy, and Bantu languages <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The publication "Alexandre" is a Creole manual, more of a small educational book aimed at tourists and foreign workers who come to Mauritius. <sep><sep> The work here is what motivated him, and his commitment is highlighted in his introduction. I was told more than once while living in Mauritius that Creole does not have grammar. <sep><sep> To any linguist, this is patently untrue. But to anyone who doubts this, I offer this booklet as written proof. Recognition of Mauritian Creole as a language with a structure to limit the level of specialists, as seen in the articles published in several editions of L'Express, to assert before the Mauritian population that Mauritian Creole is a language and should be given national status. <sep><sep> Despite the scientific truth they were transmitting, these articles sparked controversy in Mauritian society, fueled by a political context where debates on the revaluation of the Creole language were beginning to develop. <sep><sep> Creole is not a language; it does not have spelling, grammar, or a dictionary. The resistance movements were so strong that promoters of the Creole language had little chance to face them until now. <sep><sep> One can say that it is this strong resistance among the factors that have made linguistic studies on Mauritian Creole dynamic. <sep><sep> From national debates on promoting the Creole language to almost being compulsory, linguists have demonstrated scientifically that Mauritian Creole is a language. <sep><sep> Scientific studies must be developed at all levels - foundational, ethical, and syntactic - to demonstrate that Mauritian Creole has a rigorous grammar; lexicological plans to publish dictionaries; sociolinguistic plans to show that Mauritian Creole is spoken by the majority of Mauritians and therefore is a national language. <sep><sep> Linguistic studies have been presented on the strictness of Mauritian Creole in the various reports following specific Mauritian Creole studies on the strictness of Mauritian Creole, and as a result, we are limiting the presentations in this report to theses, books, and scientific articles. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> actually, we can observe a particular interest in the analysis of the functioning and structure of Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> translation more than once people have told me when I was in Mauritius that Creole has no grammar <sep><sep> for any linguist, it is evident that it is a question but I am offering this book as a black pearl on white for anyone who has any doubts <sep><sep> theses the first theses on Mauritian Creole dating back to the beginning of the years <sep><sep> bibliography oceanic linguistics special publications a recent first thesis on the variation of Creole and Bhojpuri presented by Domingue at the University of Texas <sep><sep> it is these first theses that focus specifically on Mauritian Creole and the structure of Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> this supported by the University of Montpellier represents an initial doctoral level study on the sounds and phonological system of Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> his work also includes a presentation of the lexicon in its appendix <sep><sep> the first thesis that focuses on the syntax of Mauritian Creole is a thesis that Morghen deposited at the University of Nice <sep><sep> as its title indicates, the study of the structure of Creole in Mauritius adopts a structural lens but according to generative grammar theory and transformational Chomsky <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the doctoral research years in Mauritian Creole syntax, an exception like the aspect of empty categories in Mauritian Creole is apparent at the University of Essex <sep><sep> Over the years and years research topics have focused primarily on the use of languages in Mauritius <sep><sep> Hookoomsing's thesis was presented at Laval University in Quebec focusing on Mauritian Creole in contact with other languages found in its environment, also with an interest in interference in the strictness of the language <sep><sep> In her thesis deposited at the  INALCO Paris, she used a syntactic approach to analyze the representation of this situation in Mauritian Creole speech, focusing on its information <sep><sep> This period has been marked primarily by the first thesis on the development of languages where children speak Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> This thesis was presented by Adone at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany <sep><sep> And in CAID, who supported the University of Aix-en-Provence under the direction of Chaudenson, conducted a comparative syntactic study of the verbal system in Mauritian Creole and Reunion Creole <sep><sep> Her thesis is scheduled for publication this year <sep><sep> The number of theses on the syntax and functioning of Mauritian Creole highlights the interest this field is garnering today <sep><sep> National Institute of Languages and Eastern Civilizations <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian Creole syntagm in connection with the use of information technology means in front of a linguistic panel at the University of Mauritius and the University of Paris VII <sep><sep> In the same year, Fon Sing defended a thesis comparing the verbal markers in Mauritian Creole and Haitian Creole at the University of Paris III Sorbonne Nouvelle <sep><sep> Guillemin will present his thesis at the University of Queensland in Australia on nominal phrase structure in Mauritian Creole, while Florigny will present her thesis on French and Creole acquisition by Mauritian children and how they construct a story at the University of Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense <sep><sep> The published books present a specific description of strictly limited Mauritian Creole morphosyntax <sep><sep> Baker's book certainly serves as a reference on this plan because it is the first consistent description published by a linguist <sep><sep> He will also publish his course in these books, units accompanied by a cassette for a course on Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> For those interested in publications on Creole languages in general, Valdman's publications are a reference <sep><sep> The years marked by publications of the first dictionaries <sep><sep> Other types of books are books for a wider Mauritian or foreign audience <sep><sep> Among us, we can mention Goswamy Seetohul, David and Seenyen who have published works presenting the use of Mauritian Creole in different contexts and have been reedited multiple times since they are meant for both Francophone and Anglophone tourists <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> as an adolescent can publish a modified version of his thesis in the John Benjamins edition specialized in works concerning creole languages: "The Acquisition of Mauritian Creole" <sep><sep> it is also published in collaboration with Plag and Ingo a collective work "Creolization and Language Change" <sep><sep> the same year a second collective work published by Véronique Met in relation to the phenomenon of creolization and the acquisition of languages, "Publications on the historical creole syntax" <sep><sep> we find interest in the formation of creole languages in relation to the acquisition phenomenon in the publication of "Degraf" where Adone is among the dictionaries LPT, Baker Hookoomsing trilingual dictionary <sep><sep> collaboration with Vainikka made a contribution on the acquisition of WH questions in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> in the outdoor version of the thesis Caid, we can also mention collective work edited by Plag on the phonology and morphology of creole languages, as well as a new publication on recent developments in creole studies <sep><sep> a corpus that will bring significant development at an international level in lexicological domain is published in the Assimil edition, a method for learning Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> the following year, in Frewland, it also published their method for learning Mauritian Creole in seven lessons <sep><sep> from their side, Baker and Fon Sing released their book years later, where a dozen linguists explain the evolution of structures in Mauritian Creole and their functioning today from ancient texts in creole <sep><sep> in a broader perspective, another book to be released in the middle of the year where they will make a comparison of Creole languages syntax from Gadelii and Zribiherz to Holm and Patrick. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> one of the last linguists to present a syntactic analysis of Mauritian Creole is Virahsawmy in his book Bilingualism in Mauritian and English from which

make reference to a state and not an action <sep><sep> For example, the verb 'rest' or 'sleep' <sep><sep> May play in Mauritian Creole, the same year Moufene published a study comparing the reflexive forms of Mauritian Creole and Haitian Creole <sep><sep> After publication directed at reviewing language on the syntax of Creole languages, Véronique will address the variations that affect a verb in Mauritian Creole and provide terms that signal these variations over time and mode <sep><sep> A little later Véronique will publish another article comparing the development of negation in Creole and acquisition of negation in the French foreign language <sep><sep> The same year recognized to edit an article that is in preparation for what is happening when a person is learning a second language

determinants defined and specific in Mauritian Creole in the same vein <sep><sep> from the same diachronic perspective, Guillemin will publish an article on the evolution of nominal phrase structure in Mauritian Creole in that same vein <sep><sep> at the same time, Henri will publish an article on the possible implementation of a Mauritian Creole grammar when using information technology <sep><sep> he will also publish, with that same vein, another work together with Abeillé on the syntax of constructions that have a copular verb in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> soon, Henri and Abeillé will present another work at Stanford University on long and short verbal forms in Mauritian Creole and how they function <sep><sep> in the same year, alleesaib will present a work on pronouns in Mauritian Creole at the University of Essex <sep><sep> always in them, he and Henri will present <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> another job on relativising drop a subject relativization in the University of Oxford <sep><sep> decided to publish an article on the Mauritian Creole language this year, based on reflections of its memory from a structural perspective <sep><sep> this same year, Guillemin will rewrite another article on the determiners in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> morphological processes in general that interest us when we talk about morphology, the first thing that interests us are the words found in a language <sep><sep> but there are ways to study words in a language on a morphological level <sep><sep> the first way we study how words change forms in a language depending on different criteria and different contexts <sep><sep> we call this flexional morphology <sep><sep> there is a second way where we focus on how we are interested in words that have been created in the language according to different procedures <sep><sep> we refer to this as derivational morphology <sep><sep> but there are also other ways of creating words in a language <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Among the processes of trans-categorization, composition, reduplication, borrowing, and neologism <sep> <sep> Inflectional morphology from the start interests us in a way that morphemes can change their form depending on the same grammatical category according to certain grammatical criteria such as plural and singular nouns, masculine and feminine genders, personal pronouns, etc. <sep> <sep> Let's take, for example, a language like French <sep> <sep> Depending on whether an adjective is singular or plural, masculine or feminine, it will not be written the same way <sep> <sep> For example, when a masculine singular adjective in French "un long baton" becomes "longue" when it is feminine singular "une longue robe", "longs" when it is masculine plural "de longs batons", "longues" when it is feminine plural "de longues robes" <sep> <sep> We say it is a variable word <sep> <sep> In a language like Mauritian Creole, on the other hand, the adjective "long" does not change form in any grammatical context <sep> <sep> We say it is invariable <sep> <sep> When we are interested in this type of study, inflectional morphology, in Mauritian Creole, as in many other creole languages, does not play a significant role because variations in word forms based on general grammatical criteria are not present except in certain cases. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> for certain job titles, for example, director, directress, health, chef <sep><sep> chef <sep><sep> Arnaud is also some names that can be used as adjectives, such as crazy, crazy, flying, flying, maintaining, maintaining <sep><sep> for example, the distinction between masculine and feminine grammatical gender does not exist for words <sep><sep> here Mauritian Creole behaves exactly like English, but it is different from French <sep><sep> while in French my chair is feminine, here chair, fauteuil, it is masculine, a chair, an armchair in English, they are neither masculine nor feminine, like a saw, a hammer, a saw, a hammer, and in Creole <sep><sep> the distinction of number also does not exist in grammatical forms of words <sep><sep> singular and plural are written the same, one child, several children, a bunch of children <sep><sep> there is no plural s in the end of words <sep><sep> there is only one word that needs to be added sometimes to indicate a plural marker <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a group of children, these children, these children <sep><sep> The distinction of tense in verbs also does not have many forms <sep><sep> Come here to write like we are currently I am coming here which we are in a past I went  I came  I walked or in the future I will go  to come  to walk <sep><sep> The only alternation that verbs know in Mauritian Creole is not a lot their forms have a long or full form that is used when the verb is autonomous <sep><sep> That is where in general there is no complement I am going you are coming he is walking <sep><sep> There is a short or medial form that is used when the verb is followed by a complement I am going home you came to school he was walking in the garden <sep><sep> For example chekcheke

interest is the way in which words in a language form either from existing words or from other procedures <sep><sep> Derivation with prefixes one word can be derived on another word only because we added a prefix to it <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Derivation with suffixes is a key aspect especially with the suffixes that have allowed the creation of new words in Mauritian Creole. This means that we are not only considering the words that have come directly from another language but also the suffixes. <sep><sep> But the main principle applies with all cases where one can distinguish one word in Creole from another solely by the presence or absence of a suffix. <sep><sep> For example, in the sense of someone who is sick or in a wrongful way taken from the creole verb "fane" meaning in the sense of someone who is sick or in a wrongful way and the suffix "azaner". <sep><sep> Linguistic enunciation <sep><sep> Its origin and its principle of linguistic analysis enunciation in line with the subjective perspective of individuals who use it in a communicative situation. <sep><sep> In this context, we are presenting linguistic forms that highlight our speech in terms of how a speaker expresses oneself, the way they define themselves, and the person they refer to in their speech with the context and setting where they are expressing themselves. <sep><sep> Linguistic enunciation has been developed from the work of a French linguist Emile Benveniste in his publication "Problems of General Linguistics". <sep><sep> In it, he categorizes a series of texts that critically develop the theory that Ferdinand de Saussure was able to identify with certain American linguists. <sep><sep> Emile Benveniste was a disciple of Ferdinand de Saussure. <sep><sep> Through the texts that he published, he wanted to challenge the excessive development that certain American linguists gave to structuralism; they assigned too much importance to their linguistic form analysis while neglecting the semantic dimension and the origin that defines a language. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In his reflection, Émile Benveniste proposed an analytical perspective that replaces the concept of 'Imin' with a sense of preoccupation for linguists. <sep><sep> he also chose to analyze a language like the one practiced in reality, a complementary aspect compared to the Saussure approach, where he shows that a language is a virtual system that exists only in terms of linguistic competence when not being used. <sep><sep> Benveniste was so relevant in his rectification approach that his publications gave birth to the theory of enunciation, which forms the basis of what we call today enunciation linguistic. <sep><sep> Benveniste highlighted the fact that when a person speaks in reality, he uses linguistic forms and structures that he knows and reorganizes them according to his subjective perspective to produce words that make sense at a level of writing or oral expression. <sep><sep> Linguists consider Benveniste's work more as an anthropological approach to the fact that language is an elite factor. <sep><sep> Other linguists such as Maingueneau, Culioli, and Kerbrat-Orecchioni mainly use his approach and emphasize the need to make a distinction between the use of linguistic forms and structures in relation to enunciation situations and other contexts of use. <sep><sep> The French linguist description Antoine Culioli and his team are very explicit in our reference point, which they use to define the different types of relationships that a speaker establishes between what he is designating and his communication situation. <sep><sep> They worked on language activities as revealed by the forms used in an utterance. <sep><sep> In fact, when a speaker uses linguistic forms relative to his communication situation, he literally provides references on how he positions himself and his interlocutor as well as how he positions what he is saying relative to that situation. <sep><sep> There are three types of references that a speaker can make. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a valuable identification value as it is equivalent to several reference points in communication situations <sep><sep> Lociter uses a linguistic form that refers to the moment of enunciation or non-enunciation <sep><sep> For example, I am coming in which refers to the locater <sep><sep> Indicates that there is a different value <sep><sep> The locater uses linguistic forms signaling that what it is designating is different but still in relation to the moment of enunciation or non-enunciation <sep><sep> For example, when you are in a conversation with someone with whom the locater is in relation to when he is speaking <sep><sep> Oral or written text that has occurred in a communication situation <sep><sep> Indicates that there is a repeater value <sep><sep> The locater uses linguistic forms signaling that what he is designating is different and also in relation to the moment of enunciation or non-enunciation <sep><sep> For example, he is coming in which refers to the person with whom the locater is speaking and with whom he has no relationship when talking <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kerbrat-Orecchini also explicitly specifies when it chooses to use notions of temporal localization and spatial localization to signify strict time and space reference points activities in the language of the speakers <sep><sep> We will also use the theories that Vandeloi has presented to describe the geographical space in general, and we will adapt it for our knowledge of the Sapit space <sep><sep> The interest of theory enunciation for a description of Mauritian Creole theory enunciation is particularly effective in accounting for and structuring the resources available in a specific language so that an individual can develop and perfect the fundamental aspects of their language skills in a communication situation <sep><sep> What linguists call language faculty is a cognitive skill that is common to everyone <sep><sep> This skill develops progressively and naturally with experience when a child is learning things <sep><sep> Teaching this language in a formal context such as school allows a speaker to be aware of all the resources available in that language so that they can develop communication competencies faster, becoming more varied and complex and with competencies to learn multiple languages <sep><sep> Among the aspects of the language faculty that one must develop is the competence to express oneself based on references that define their communication situation , referential interlocutor, co-speaking interlocutor in Mauritian Creole, me, you, us <sep><sep> Reference moment where the interlocutor inscribes their words now, which will serve to locate what they are saying in time. Reference location where the interlocutor inscribes their words here, which will serve to locate what they are saying in space <sep><sep> This competence is fundamental because it is essentially in reference to the communication situation in which an individual can at one moment produce an oral or written word that makes sense, and at another moment understand a word said orally or written that they are listening to or reading <sep><sep> More importantly, it is through practicing speaking in real communication situations that an individual defines their personal identity and personality in a network of family and social relationships, becoming aware and structuring their time and space that characterizes their life, conditions their mental balance and makes their life possible in society <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Interaction in a communicative situation is defined as necessary by a person who takes the floor to address another person <sep><sep> The person who takes the floor is called the 'locutor' and the person to whom the 'locutor' is addressing is called the 'collocutor', as in an interactional situation both parties are active, either talking, listening, or interpreting the words being heard or being read <sep><sep> Furthermore, the roles of 'locutor' and 'collocutor' are not fixed roles, each takes their turn to be the 'locutor' when they take the floor in a conversation with another person who is not speaking but listening, takes on the role of 'collocutor' <sep><sep> We will call you both 'interlocutors' <sep><sep> Of course, experience shows that there may be several 'locutors' even if it is rare, and several 'interlocutors' who often come along <sep><sep> Already, in its publications, which are on the linguistic enunciation, Benveniste's the subjectivity of a person is evident in the words as a landmark where the subjectivity of a person manifests <sep><sep> In his theory, Benveniste takes an extremely perspective on this speech activity when he says that it is through and by his speech activity that a person exists and gives existence to the person with whom he is speaking is ego celui qui dit ego <sep><sep> It is imperative that other linguists have found it necessary to make a distinction between a person who exists beyond his speech activity and another where his own subjectivity that he shows in his speech when he speaks in a particular communication situation <sep><sep> This example allows us to illustrate this distinction. For example, say 'Atish, I am coming to your place tomorrow' Jacques tells Atish, 'I am coming to your place tomorrow' by term, Atish is identifying himself as the person saying these words <sep><sep> By 'you,' he is identifying Atish as his collocutor and a collocutor with whom he is quite close that he can address him as 'tu' <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> he is talking about a trip that he is going to take in the direction of the country where his roommate lives near to you <sep> <sep> he is imagining this trip from the perspective where he and his roommate will be when he will <sep> <sep> he has arrived he does not use the verb go but the verb come <sep> <sep> for he is locating his trip tomorrow where he is saying those words <sep> <sep> at the same time he is giving his trip a present value when he uses present form instead of future form for his verb that it is a lapse that lets let's see going that is happening as an action that he is realizing anyway in his mind more than as an intention <sep> <sep> we find that whatever I use in this simple word gives us information on the perspective of the action <sep> <sep> this is reflected in the dialogue focusing on the linguistic terms that a speaker uses in Mauritian Creole to make reference to himself or his roommates <sep> <sep> these terms reveal the role and identity that the speaker gives himself and his roommates <sep> <sep> they also reveal the relationship that is being established by the speaker <sep> <sep> in Mauritian Creole the linguistic forms that make reference to the speaker take the form of syntactic identities that follow personal pronouns possessive determiners proper nouns in cases where the speaker is referring to himself or addressing another person <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> grammar language highlights that pronouns referring to the speaker and the listener have a particular function <sep><sep> their priority function is not to simply replace another noun according to the traditional grammar definition of a pronoun, but primarily to directly refer to the people in dialogue in a communication situation <sep><sep> grammar language identifies this functional type as a deictic function <sep><sep> in our description, we are keeping the traditional designation of personal pronouns that everyone knows, and that we find in certain cases that we are presenting in more detail within the following descriptions <sep><sep> it is also important to note that speech activity defines the function of the speaker and the listener <sep><sep> meaning that even if in the real world we know that a priori only people who can enter into dialogue in the imaginary world the terminology is metalinguistic that people already know and that is common to the grammars used in English and French <sep><sep> temporal localization mainly stems from the moment of dialogue where the interlocutors make a temporal localization <sep><sep> the moment of dialogue that corresponds to the fundamental temporal category refers to all that a speaker considers to be happening simultaneously with the moment of dialogue, whether it is located before in anteriority to that moment, considered as past, or whether it is located after in posteriority to consider as future <sep><sep> past present future thus their subjetive categories will have different references every time a speaker takes the floor <sep><sep> the interior categories past present future make it possible to make a temporal localization from another reference point that the moment of dialogue <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> this reference is in any case segmented according to the time of enunciation <sep><sep> in fact this reference is already situated in a category past or future before using it to situate another action or situation before or after it <sep><sep> in the case of a temporal localization according to us it will not talk about the present because you will use rather anteriority simultaneity or posteriority in the past or in the future in the present it is obvious that there is no localization <sep><sep> linguistic forms which a speaker uses to locate temporally an action or a situation translate also other temporal characteristics such as frequency perspective retrospection or prospection delimitation <sep><sep> as we are giving priority to the phenomenon of temporal localization precision these other characteristics are integrated in the commentary that is being made for each type of localization that is being presented <sep><sep> to understand how speakers use linguistic forms to temporally locate actions or situations we are analyzing in the first place certain preverbal markers in their usage before a verb before moving on to other temporal markers available in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> we give this term a generic meaning to designate monosyllabic terms that are used before a verb to make a temporal localization <sep><sep> spatial localization as we mentioned in our introduction has three domains in which we refer when we are going to talk about something first there must be interlocutors second there must be a temporal localization third there must be a spatial localization in this chapter we will present more in detail what we call spatial localization or space description <sep><sep> every language uses different means to signal the positioning of a person or an object in space <sep><sep> if it is moving where it comes from or where it is going <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a communication situation, it is from the field where interaction is taking place that the interlocutor will give the location of objects or people in space <sep><sep> The field where a locator is pointing out the same space that he will refer to and that he will call here <sep><sep> Like all other places, to describe by opposition and here we can say that here is a fundamental spatial reference point <sep><sep> A language has three means to describe space <sep><sep> there is what we call topological reference, meaning where objects are located in space <sep><sep> there is a projective reference, meaning how the locator perceives space <sep><sep> finally, there are verbs that express movement like going, coming, etc <sep><sep> theories that we will use <sep><sep> a functional description before we start describing space we think it is important that we give a definition for the three terms that we will use in our description work <sep><sep> the first thing we need to note is that we will not use the term direction but rather the term orientation to define space <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Let's consider an object that is positioned directly in front of us, it is always necessary for us to be in line with our gaze <sep><sep> In this context, there are several problems such as how we would talk about a bird in front of us but flying in the sky or if we're in Chamarel how we would talk about the river and the mountain range in front of us but underneath where the mountain lies, we would use geometric directions such as vertical, frontal, and lateral as reference points for our description <sep><sep> The geometric directions we'll use as a functional method for describing space in Mauritian Creole, that is, how we'll describe words in relation to the knowledge we believe all Creole-speaking inhabitants have and use in all languages to describe space <sep><sep> There are five pieces of information a person must have to correctly indicate where an object is located <sep><sep> The first piece of information is proper positioning <sep><sep> It is based on our perception of its symmetry which we define as front, general orientation, lateral left and right <sep><sep> The second piece of information is basic physics, that is not scientific <sep><sep> Here we're talking about the information that everyone uses to describe the world, for example the relationship between content and container <sep><sep> The third classification is based on what we find in the first <sep><sep> For example, a balloon that is behind us in our consideration <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> there is a lottery in front of us but we can't find it because there is a mirror between us and the lottery we will say that the lottery is behind that mirror <sep><sep> then one has to ade between these two examples which in both cases we can't find a ball and a lottery because there is a lot of something between those objects and us we are either a mirror in this case <sep><sep> the fourth ranking is based on what is closest to a destination <sep><sep> here we are talking about objects in motion and that are going to meet a destination <sep><sep> if we go straight to a field course on saturday first run that is the closest to its destination we can say that it is ahead of the others runs <sep><sep> we allow us to say that it is ahead of the other runs only because it is the closest to the finish line <sep><sep> finally the last thing we call general orientation and lateral orientation <sep><sep> general orientation is a concept that is greater than what we have called frontal direction <sep><sep> in this case there is also a direction direction of a movement or even a direction of where we are looking <sep><sep> lateral orientation is easier to describe afterwards <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> lateral orientation is perpendicular to the general orientation <sep><sep> intrinsic orientation has lobes with their own orientation that cannot be changed <sep><sep> if we look at the skin of a person or another they both have a front and a back that never change <sep><sep> even if a person or another is turned around, they will always have their own orientation <sep><sep> the head of a person always faces forward and their back faces in their general orientation <sep><sep> likewise if a person is walking backward or looking left or right their general and lateral orientation will not change their front and back as their right side and left side will not depend on the direction the person is moving neither on the direction their gaze is moving <sep><sep> contextual orientation has lobes that do not have their own orientation like a foot a ball or a cube <sep><sep> it is always the location that provides them with a defined orientation where the front and back right and left sides are <sep><sep> the location can define this orientation either in relation to its own position or in relation to another place that will have an intrinsic orientation <sep><sep> and the division of space into small spaces tiny spaces a description of space and its division into small spaces linked to the placement of a site in space <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are describing here different spaces found on a design n <sep><sep>Microspaces topological interior space it is very flexible and we can connect it with lobes that have very different forms <sep><sep> One site it can be closed or partially open ex <sep><sep> the interior of a boat <sep><sep> we can also imagine that this space has two or three dimensions ex <sep><sep> the interior of a car or a house <sep><sep> There are no characteristic features that will define the form of this space but we can say that there is a combination of characteristics <sep><sep> for example we can consider a lobe that has three dimensions that has an empty space inside and that closes it for a container meaning a lobe that can contain other things inside ex <sep><sep> a box a case a house a lottery <sep><sep> a frontier it closes the interior space <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes it'll be a surface that has two dimensions <sep><sep> on the edge of a table or a surface that has only one dimension <sep><sep> on the seaside depending on the lobes shape that it is taking but <sep><sep> the space in between the surfaces or surroundings is around the place where a seat was <sep><sep> the space in between goes up to the border <sep><sep> for example, the space around a house is its surroundings of its yard but it stops at the gate of the surroundings and the wall that surrounds the courtyard <sep><sep> the exterior space is opposed with the interior space <sep><sep> we can say that it starts where there's a border and that there's no limit <sep><sep> we can consider that it extends to infinity in all directions depending on the conception of that space unless we consider that that space is in two or three dimensions <sep><sep> by creating complex sites most expressions that we use to describe space involve a relationship between a set and a unique site. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, there are some tools that we use to represent complex sites made up of several smaller things <sep><sep> For example, when we are placing a bookshelf in a library <sep><sep> we will explain this part in more detail a little later <sep><sep> these positional sanctions also make a difference between a location that is not moving and a location that is a site <sep><sep> it is often verbs that indicate whether there is movement or displacement <sep><sep> there are verbs that place an object in space without movement, like standing, sitting, or lying down <sep><sep> there are also location verbs that place an object in space and indicate that the object is moving, like going or coming <sep><sep> a Creole Mauritian space description that we have just finished explaining the concepts we use to describe the space we will look at the terms used in Creole Mauritian to describe the space <sep><sep> accessibility placement in space, first we will talk about spatial relationships related to accessibility because they do not depend on direction so we can say that they are simpler <sep><sep> we are done <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They provide accurate general information on the history of writing <sep><sep> Preliminary and general, even if the information we are giving here may seem obvious to some, we think it is important to emphasize them here as a reminder just so that we are on the same page <sep><sep> The difference between speaking and writing is that speaking is a universal faculty that all human beings possess from birth, whereas writing is a social practice that depends on specific learning <sep><sep> Until now, in the world, especially in developing countries, there are a large number of people who have not had access to education <sep><sep> In all cultures or civilizations where a natural language has evolved, literacy has come before and has been practiced for a long time before the development of writing <sep><sep> It is only artificial languages like Esperanto and Volapuk that have adapted graphic systems before demonstrating that they have learned to speak them <sep><sep> But they are relative as common effective languages which means that there are very few people who have managed to articulate themselves clearly, giving us a clear indication of their limitations and making us understand that they are out of touch with reality <sep><sep> When we talk about standardization of spelling, it is a good reminder that we are making reference to the unique Creole spelling of Mauritians and not the way people talk <sep><sep> It is important for people communicating in writing to have a spelling to ensure that they understand their peers and avoid confusion and misunderstandings when exchanging information <sep><sep> It also represents a major economic cost in terms of time and energy spent on it <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In his oral dimension, it is necessary for a language to be able to evolve over time and accept the function of variation simultaneously. <sep><sep> Without one variety appearing superior to another. <sep><sep> It is essential that each has its own function, value, and context where it should be used. <sep><sep> It is the flexibility and ability of a language to adapt and accept modifications, its availability to enrich itself with new contributions from other languages that determine its vibrancy and dynamism. <sep><sep> It is also conditioned by its usage over time. <sep><sep> This is why the standardization of Mauritian Creole has a unique link to the Mauritian Creole speakers and a way to write it, but not a way to speak it, even though many people may believe that there are certain ways of pronouncing a word that is more Creole, meaning more native, than another and some that are more artificial. <sep><sep> But here we enter into subjective and ideological domains and there is nothing to do with objective and technical standardization which is our objective in this regard. <sep><sep> The difference between writing systems, spelling and orthography in a general way, writing refers to a social practice where a people, an individual, a culture, a civilization, etc. use a graphic representational system to express, share information, communicate or construct reflections that articulate arguments without needing to use their voice. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Graphy is a social practice that depends on an apprenticeship system of graphic representation that reflects people's culture, civilization, etc. <sep> It is used to depend on conventions such as the ability for multiple people to sit together and agree on a system. <sep> When a system is not accepted by an authority or does not have the majority of people who are part of the culture, civilization, etc. <sep> Or who write in a language, each person or group of people will have their own system. <sep> This system we call it a graphy. <sep> Multiple graphies can coexist at the same time for a language. <sep> The spelling the day majority of people who write accept to align themselves on a graph or an authority decides to propose a graphic system as a graphical reference to become standard, and we start to enter a phase where we can start talking about the spelling of the language. <sep> An orthography is the correct way to write words in a language based on a standard graph. <sep> It includes aspects related to grammar of the language, the way words are broken down, for example, but sometimes, semantic criteria of the words that sound the same can be written differently just to make a difference between their meanings. <sep> In order to properly measure the impact that writing represents in the development and evolution of a language, we need to have a quick overview of the history of writing in a general way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A brief history of the appearance and development of writing systems in the world. The use of pictograms, ideograms, and phonograms required that writing had appeared before and evolved between and before our time when certain people settled more often, became nomadic in the Mesopotamian region and gradually became agricultural, hence sedentary and began to find the need to draw lines for their good and for things like agriculture, land measurement, cereal, etc. <sep> <sep> There are traces that go back to that time that demonstrate that those peoples had already developed counting systems. <sep> <sep> But the true writing system appeared for the first time... before and during our time in the culture of the Sumerian people always in the Mesopotamian region. <sep> <sep> First, they began to use signs to represent concrete things that appeared in reality. <sep> <sep> Then they used symbols to represent words or ideas. <sep> <sep> The system began to accelerate from a time when it was possible to engrave signs on clay tablets. <sep> <sep> The evolution of writing at that time was known in two phases, a first phase called the pictogram phase and a second phase called the ideogram phase. <sep> <sep> The pictogram phase, a pictogram writing is a writing that is based essentially on designs that serve to represent a reality directly. <sep> <sep> Take three examples of pictograms that the Sumerians used and apply them to Mauritian Creole. <sep> <sep> Three examples of pictograms - foot, hand, fish - a special thanks to Shameem Oozeerally for his active contribution in this section. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In today's society, pictograms still have their importance in certain contexts <sep><sep> An example: the stage of ideogram an ideogram makes reference to a symbol that is used to represent a word or an idea <sep><sep> Three examples of ideograms: in Ancient Egyptian ideograms, a house or building, in Etruscan ideograms, a head, in Chinese ideograms, after the stage of pictograms, several civilizations have developed their writing systems to become ideographic systems <sep><sep> Among the most commonly found ideographic writing systems are the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic system, used in the time of the pharaohs, and the Chinese writing system, which is still in use today <sep><sep> The phonogram stage of modern writing begins when graphic systems emerge from the ideographic phase and enter the phonographic phase, where the writing system serves as signs not to represent real objects or words or ideas but sounds <sep><sep> A phonogram is a sign used to represent a consonant or vowel sound present in speech when using a language <sep><sep> Alphabetic writing systems, which are used in most languages today, are based on a phonographic principle <sep><sep> HTML indicates a place where an Indigenous American language spoken in Canada and still using ideograms <sep><sep> The first alphabetic writing system was the consonantal system of the Phoenician people, French Phoenician, English Phoenician, a Semitic people who lived in the Palestinian region several centuries before our era, which developed the first writing system based on phonograms and started the alphabetic writing phase <sep><sep> But the alphabet that the Phoenicians developed was not the same as the Mauritian Creole consonantal system, which was an alphabet that represented only consonants <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Greek alphabet was developed before we had the Greeks who had adopted the consonantal alphabetic script that the Phoenicians had developed and added vowels to it <sep><sep> So it is from the Greeks that we began to acquire alphabets in modern languages that we know today <sep><sep> After the Greeks came the Romans who aligned themselves on the alphabetic script of Latin based on the Greek alphabet <sep><sep> Semitic languages refer to a group of languages and by extension the peoples who speak them that have been used since the ancient period in the Middle Eastern regions of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, and part of North Africa <sep><sep> Among them were the Sumerian, Phoenician, and Aramaic languages that have disappeared today <sep><sep> Arabic and Hebrew are part of the Semitic languages that are still alive today <sep><sep> It is the Roman alphabet that has influenced the writing systems of the European languages through the spread of Latin and it is also this system that we are adopting for Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> The transition of a language from the oral stage to the written stage when a language that was mainly used as an oral language begins to shift to a written language transformation that the language goes through has several implications at various levels <sep><sep> These levels concern the user of the language, the society in which it is used and the language itself looking at the grammatical structures or the corpora for more details <sep><sep> We can present this in a diagram illustrating this situation <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The message that needs to be remembered here is that this transition goes beyond a mere transcription on paper or another support that records what we say orally <sep> It involves complex mental operations at the level of language, social transformations, especially among individuals who use this language, a greater sense of respect among themselves, particularly with technological modifications in the structure of the language, its vocabulary becomes richer, its grammar more sophisticated, and a new type of relationship with the language because the functions that it was fulfilling have changed <sep> All of this contributes to valorizing individuals who speak the language or who associate themselves with the language on an identity level <sep> Spoken language, written language, implications for users, implications for society, implications for the language itself <sep> The stages of evolution of a language from its oral period to its written period is a transition of a language from its oral period, simple to its written period and it is not by several stages <sep> It is not a transformation that happens in a spontaneous phase <sep> Rather it is a progressive evolution <sep> To explain this evolution in a simple way, we look at the stages in four movements <sep> The movement from oral verbalization to oral verbalization, we use a Creole language from Mauritius for communication and verbal expression <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this context, pronunciation, intonation, and expressiveness play a large role in the effectiveness of message transmission and reception <sep><sep> The oral written stage of a language's evolution in the oral written stage, we begin to put on a written support things that we can say in Mauritian Creole more easily verbally when we use a language <sep><sep> It is a simple transcription, not a true script of the text. C <sep><sep> Baissac  or f <sep><sep> Chrestien  for example, for Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> Writing stage and written stage writing writing stage writing stage writing the language already has a writing system <sep><sep> It means that the language already has a written language <sep><sep> What appears on paper is not just a transcription of what is easy to say orally, but a way to express what has been freed from it and the features that typically characterize orality <sep><sep> The written stage verbalizes the written stage verbalizes represents the last stage of the progression of a language <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> once a language is written, it has developed for communication and progress in logic so we take new structures that the language has developed on the written plan and insert them into certain types of oral communication. <sep> 

<sep> in summary, we can summarize these four stages with another evolutionary diagram of a language from the simple oral stage to the complex written stage, verbalize written graphic oral graphic oral verbalize the written stage and the oral stage. <sep> 

<sep> committee reflection on the technical aspects of Mauritian Creole on the proposals of graphic harmony. <sep> 

<sep> The technical committee on Mauritian Creole on the issue of graphic harmony which treats simple vowels and consonants that do not pose major problems in the context of standardizing Mauritian Creole after analyzing and discussing that the technical committee on Mauritian Creole considers that the vowels and consonants that appear in the report graphics. Harmony has not posed any problems for users except in some cases where the repetition of vowels is as in the examples "dil" from the angle of "deal" and "deliit" from the angle of "delete" or "kees" from the French angle "caisse" as it appears in the example "d". <sep> 

<sep> It is in view of the fact that the frequency of words where there is a vowel extension is really high in Mauritian Creole, that graphic harmony raised the question of the necessity of distinguishing them in writing this language. <sep> 

<sep> But in the technical committee on Mauritian Creole orthography, there are members who think that from a pedagogical perspective where standardizing Mauritian Creole is considered to be good keeping a graphic indication to make a distinction between a short vowel and a long vowel. <sep> 

<sep> its only problem is how to signal this distinction. <sep> 

<sep> either by indicating it through the presence of a vowel ex. <sep> 

<sep> or by adding an n vowel to the point. ex. "kes" compared to "kes dil" <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Or alternatively, through conservation of a graphical angle, it is given that all these examples come from this language. 

<sep><sep> Then the rulers would write exactly like how they write in English - case, deal, delete. 

<sep><sep> Clothes to be used to show how these rulers have become unique and it is for this reason that you have kept their strange pronunciation. 

<sep><sep> This last option that has been retained by Mauritian Creole in Réunion has a specific objective: that is, on Tuesday mornings, you will treat these rulers and as the words you have borrowed from English and the way their pronunciation is different, they will keep this strange status. 

<sep><sep> The technical committee on graphic tables, which deals with vowels and consonants, takes special attention and three explanations of graphic tables dealing with consonants, containing multiple symbols that are not frequent in common alphabets. 

<sep><sep> Commenting on the technical committee on graphic harmony, which deals with complex consonants, that have been taken from church writings that were aligned to French orthography. 

<sep><sep> Option 1, which is also used in some graphic systems, presents a disadvantage and a risk of confusion where combined letters need to be changed when alternative short and long forms are often used in words. 

<sep><sep> The technical committee on Mauritian Creole has also adopted the same principle, and here we are presenting other examples of its use - "bengnbengne", "gagngagne", "gnangnan", "pagn", "konpagne", "lakanpagn", "lagign", "montagn", etc. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Complex consonant "ch" has become a symbol that has become prevalent today to symbolize words like chakchake, chekcheke, chom, bo, chok, chiping, chous, etc. <sep>
<sep> But graphilharmony draws attention to issues where there are currents that come from English like "batch" and "match" where there is a "t" before the "ch". <sep>
<sep> Graphilharmony thinks that in these cases, the currents can maintain text more easily. <sep>
<sep> This principle has been approved by Mauritian Creole in the Reunion meeting. <sep>
<sep> The only comment we want to make here is that the digraph "ch" is the only case where graphilharmony authorizes the presence of the graphic letter "c" in Mauritian Creole. <sep>
<sep> In the Mauritian dictionary, we have found the need to consider the letter "c" as a distinctive sign in a limited number of cases, such as in "cd" which should not be confused with the French verb "céder" or "vcd" which should not be confused with the French word "cheveux". <sep>
<sep> Therefore, in the proposal, Mauritian Creole spelling should have a special mark for this case, look at our special section. <sep>
<sep> Distinctive marks in the work of harmonizing graphilharmony have faced hesitation over what needs to be done in certain cases where all possible uses seem likely. <sep>
<sep> More detailed arguments will be made to make distinctions between the positions of sounds in the word, the originality of the word, its transparency in reading, etc. <sep>
<sep> After the discussion, we have come to the conclusion that for non-specialist individuals, criteria for distinguishing pronunciation on a reading level may not seem clear, and that it is preferable to consider the position criteria as a priority. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> when one goes out of a french word we impose it by itself ex <sep><sep> media diab diamond etc <sep><sep> however, when one goes out from another language like english or an indian language it is the j that seems most logical <sep><sep> baja jam jak joukal jous maja etc <sep><sep> so it is on this distinction that we have aligned ourselves <sep><sep> a digraph is a graphic sign which serves as an alphabet letter to represent a sound <sep><sep> distinction xksgz the letter x takes the value ks in words like taxi sex tax and the value gz in words like lexame expose <sep><sep> the digraph xs has been chosen in certain cases to facilitate reading <sep><sep> the example that grafilarmony gives exit and exists <sep><sep> after much reflection and discussion in the technical ko mite lkreol morisyen re command that x be used in all cases where there is a sound gz exit lexame exaggerate exile etc <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> except in exceptional cases <sep>
<sep> in cases where there is a sound ks we recommend using x especially in relatively short words like fax tax box boxe mixe mixtir and in other words that i have listed in the annex <sep>
<sep> but there are also cases where the sound ks is imposed to give clarity and readability in accordance with other languages spoken by mauritians affection aksent aksidan perfeksion etc <sep>
<sep> in the same logic it appears necessary to make a distinction between an axis focused on a precise theme and access to enough and something <sep>
<sep> for more details refer to the section table <sep>
<sep> and the list of words in the annex further on <sep>
<sep> complex vowel or simple vowel u until several graphic systems have been used u and u are used to represent its u when written in creole <sep>
<sep> grafilarmoni recommended you transcript this sound but being data which was also present in the system graphics it indicated a degree of flexibility in the possibility of choosing between u and u <sep>
<sep> according to the observation committee of technical kreol morisyen it is clear that since the use of u has become more widespread in the press publicized and educational institutions university for instance <sep>
<sep> where kreol was used <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> it also makes reading mauritian creole more easily and habitually for mauritians <sep><sep> therefore, the technical committee for mauritian creole recommends using it also to graphically represent sounds such as "u", while being aware that the 'u' will continue to be used for a certain period of time in other graphic systems for this function <sep><sep> does this mean that the technical committee on mauritian creole spelling has no role to play when writing mauritian creole as the mauritian creole technical committee has proposed the use of "u" to represent the sound "u" that comes from english and that is currently present in words in creole like 'flush', 'rush', 'duster', 'brushing', etc <sep><sep> for more details on this subject, see the section on this question <sep><sep> nasal vowels "an", "on" and "in" the distinction between nasal vowels and consonants is established through the formil 'nnn' that the technical committee has used and that has been well established in practice of writing and reading in mauritian creole <sep><sep> graph harmony has aligned itself on the same principles and this is also what the mauritian creole technical committee is doing <sep><sep> however, if the treatment of vowel "an" does not pose any problems at the reading level or writing level, for example: 'zanfan', 'andan', 'kontan', 'elefan', 'zean', etc <sep><sep> the vowel "on" has also been accepted as a graphic symbol for transcribing nasal vowel "o": 'mouton', 'kapon', 'pizon', 'bonbon', 'pwason', etc <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the majority of practitioners agree to create an exception here <sep><sep> It concerns the differences we think should be made between the categories of grammar and the way to address a person we are writing to with an m and the adverbial negation <sep><sep> This distinction is important to avoid confusion between these two words when reading the frequency of students who all have in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> Once we have reached a point of exception for the noun, we extend it to the words that are directly derived from a noun: nickname, first name, pronoun, etc <sep><sep> To make it more consistent with the system <sep><sep> on a slightly more serious problem that has been posed and its implications are heavier <sep><sep> the technical committee of Kreol Morisyan has expressed enough regret for the comments made in the press by some practitioners who have built in Creole so that possible confusion can be had on the graphic signs that must be chosen between the two, so as to transcribe the nasal vowel found in the sound, such as the way it is pronounced in French <sep><sep> The problem has been mentioned, for example, in an article that appeared in the Express and now where the article was placed in the musical graph harmony provides two possibilities for the Nasalization of e is <sep><sep> it gives the choice of in or en <sep><sep> This is due to the confusion that can arise, the other can become the other <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This confusion that people have felt has brought different options in the practical use of writing in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> Some have chosen to align themselves mainly with adaptations in one way while others have leaned towards keeping doors open and exploring all possibilities <sep><sep> While there are those who have opted for a systematic approach in all circumstances to represent that sound <sep><sep> with the result being that we get words like invitation, international, incapable, to bring about destinies that mention sailors, parents, etc <sep><sep> in competition with international invitations, unable to bring destinies of sailors, rabbits, etc <sep><sep> after we have reconsidered the graph harmony in the last two stanzas of this chapter we are proposing here our comments and suggestions <sep><sep> in a table that presents the graph harmony see version 'kr eol' more clearly {it is clear which option the graph harmony really offers to represent sonnazal with 'en' as an example} <sep><sep> it only signals and in its right-hand column next to 'lpt' allows for a flexibility between symbols and gives as an example for 'lpt' interesting code-switching between lines <sep><sep> but it is also true that in its explanation <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Graphilarmoney makes manage to allow a level of flexibility between en and en in certain cases; however, some flexibility will have to be observed since "en" is also used with the same value as in ibid. <sep><sep> It is clear that the absence of precise indications of when exactly to use "in" and "en" has created a condition where there is a certain confusion on how exactly to transcribe that sound in all circumstances and justify the criticisms that have been made on it. <sep><sep> It is more necessary today than ever to correct this absence with a clear explanation for everyone. <sep><sep> It is important to note that in the discussions preceding the decision on this issue, the committee on Graphilarmoni supported it based on reflections that were already in place before this appeal was made by other persons who had worked on preparing a graph for Morisien Creole. <sep><sep> We will especially mention those who worked on the graphic aspects for the church... where D. Virasawmy was a collaborator and, in particular, the standard graphie document for Creole, which explains the graphic options they have retained. <sep><sep> We will also mention the passages on the sound "in" that Graphilarmoni represents in its report, as in French it has been designed. <sep><sep> In French, there are several forms for the sound "in" - ain, ein, eint - but in Creole "in" will be the rule, although sometimes when "in" is followed by "n" it becomes necessary to write "e nn" to distinguish it from "inn," showing the Standard Graphie for Creole as situated by Graphilarmoney. <sep><sep> We also note that in his book "Apprendre à lire et écrire mauricien," Dr. Virasawmy introduced a graphic system that he used for his book in this way... the graphic being used here is what the Catholic Church and its newspaper "La Vie Catholique" use, which is what the translators of the Gospel of St. Mark used and what the Morisian literary website "Boukie banane" uses. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> make this lapse here and it has contributed to making itself known <sep><sep> in a more empirical way before deciding on whether this can be simpler for him it would be good to make a simple mental comparison or even go test on the ground on the degree of ease and reading that can exist between the two <sep><sep> sapin martin rotin killer pantin dolphin pati n malicious satin anfin basin rabbit tapir kookoo parent resin etc <sep><sep> and lalis b sapen marten roten reken marlen pants in dofen paten malen saten anfen basen lapen take n cook parents resin etc <sep><sep> always in an empirical way until we are not yet in the presence of Mauritians who have said that they have difficulty in distinguishing between marine marinn and marenn or lalin lalinn and lalenn once they started reading creole <sep><sep> on the other hand, an indication that shows that ocean parents and lalen require a time of adaptation before a person understands what has been written <sep><sep> in the same logic, we believe that clarity in terms of reading to distinguish masculine and feminine in certain words is facilitated by alternation inin cousincousinn vwazinvwazinn kopinkopinn malinmalinn orphanorphelinn etc <sep><sep> it is true that there are also words where the alternation between masculine and feminine occurs as in african american amerikenamerikenn but they are rather rare and especially in sequences where we find this alternation maurisianmorisienn kirpienkirpipie nn porlwizienporlwizienn etc <sep><sep> what is interesting is that it is precisely in a context where there is a symbol of graphic representation in which the in sound becomes not only useful but indispensable to transcribe nasal sounds in ancient lisien etc <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> in other cases you will not have a number <sep><sep> on the morphosyntactic level, the prefix in that means to meet in French is transparent in positions that can make between able to able impossible possible etc <sep><sep> what photography cannot do is automatically <sep><sep> but it is mainly the inter prefix that justifies more than any other graphic mark that needs to use in instead of in places in <sep><sep> the inter prefix is present in visual spaces of any kind often outside school or even before going to school in words that have posed them through media, internet, international, interval, interview, etc <sep><sep> their advantage is that they traverse several languages and have a system of an international dimension present at the same time in English and French <sep><sep> replacing some spaces with inter and getting as a result enternet, international, interval, interview represents on this plan more a difficult letter than an advantage <sep><sep> especially since the presence of a computer in places and schools today has imposed the graphic symbol inter in visual spaces all children in Mauritius in its phonetic and semantic symbolism English inter <sep><sep> for all these reasons we recommend as a general rule that the graphic sequences in retain as a symbol representing a nasal vowel in a general way except in three almost cases where it is necessary to use in in a sequence one antique Mauritian, etc. <sep><sep> b before sequences where sound <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> it seems that the final position of the sounds in the same syllable appears in various accents such as bileng monoleng peng zepeng etc <sep><sep> especially to avoid confusion between sounds like ing as found in words that come from English like meeting parking chipping etc <sep><sep> it is in Creole words that masculine enters a feminine form as in African American angel etc <sep><sep> complex vowels œ vs er ek u in Mauritian Creole there are several words that come from English with pronunciation er in the final position such as we find it for example in leader manager cutter etc <sep><sep> and women pay the most attention to this pronunciation when they have entered Creole <sep><sep> Grafilarmony proposed to use œ as a new symbol to represent this sound <sep><sep> which has given us Creole words written in this way marstœr master in English ofisœr officer in English printœr printer in English mixœr mixer in English etc <sep><sep> but grafilarmony proposed this option only on a trial basis without knowing how users will react to it <sep><sep> when the team that worked on the Mauritian dictionary published a prototype version of the dictionary in which they used er in it for example in words like burger from English burger and brushing from English brushing <sep><sep> negative comments that users of the dictionary received on this option forced the team to rethink its position on this issue <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some negative comments were expressed concerning the clarity of textual problems related to the technical difficulties in the context of text editing - it is known that it is a vowel where the two letters are supposed to be pronounced together and not separated which represents an evident complication in the technical aspect if the keyboard being used does not allow this function to work <sep><sep> For this reason, we preferred not to maintain the vowel in the final version of the dictionary, and we chose to respect the English spelling and write burger and brushing respectively <sep><sep> It is also for this reason that the vowel is not an option that the technical committee of Mauritian Kreol recommends here <sep><sep> In its place, there are two options that we have retained <sep><sep> In the final position of words where you hear the sound "r" faintly, we have proposed to use "er" as in leader, manager, sister in the hospital, etc. <sep><sep> Even though "er" is also used for simpler words like lamer, later, monper, etc. <sep><sep> In the initial or intermediate position of three words where you hear the "r" sound tends to soften and where the vowels and nn tipe are more rounded, we have proposed to use "u" as in rush, flush, brushing, etc. <sep><sep> This is why words like "duster" and "burger" have two options that are kept close to their original pronunciation and allow them to be considered as important elements in their language of origin and allow them to be considered as important elements in their language of origin because their pronunciation has not been altered when they were introduced into Creole <sep><sep> This argument found supports the argument we used here in section g and sex <sep><sep> For more details, when we mentioned examples of words that come from English and have kept their long vowels when they entered Creole, see the explanation here on how to deal delete case, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The opposition between y and i will represent the sound j, there are many people who have expressed difficulty in the sounds they make and need to know which to use between i and y in the words that appear <sep><sep> which to write station or station in the dictionary or dicitionary well or bien etc <sep><sep> the graph harmony proposed a complementary use between these two letters <sep><sep> i will be used in place of y whenever it is placed between a consonant and a vowel like in tension, kamion, morisien, dibien etc <sep><sep> y, on the other hand, will be used at the beginning and end of a syllable like in yer, may, abey, etc <sep><sep> the technical committee of Mauritian Creole has retained this principle as it allows these two letters to become complementary and their alternation avoids confusion when writing <sep><sep> the opposition between w or ou and oi will represent the sound w, opposing the option w or ou and oi in words like mwamoi, leroilerwa, kwinkoinkouin, etc <sep><sep> they have often been seen as one of the biggest difficulties people face when writing Creole <sep><sep> after discussions and exchanges between practitioners of Creole writing, the graph harmony committee chose w based on the argument that it is more easily established over time when referring to people who write and is more stable and readable by everyone once the principle is understood <sep><sep> in fact, if you apply ou or oi in a systematic way, there is a risk that we will find ourselves in a sequence where there are three vowels as in ous and wa where it is not too clear how to write <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> far or far  along with  me  neither  less <sep><sep> Therefore, for these reasons, the committee of Mauritian Creole orthographic experts has favored and proposed to generalize its use in other areas, even though we are aware that in some environments there are still a few reservations about its use instead of other words such as mwa, ledwa, lerwa, etc. <sep><sep> The only exception that we suggest here is the difference that can be made and sweetly distinguished between lwe (to read) and loue (to praise) my lord, based on the significant differences in meaning and pronunciation that exist here. <sep><sep> Summary criteria that have guided Graphic options: We will complete this part with a summary of the criteria that guided our graphic options here. <sep><sep> The main criterion of phonographic correspondence: The main criterion that has dominated our work relates to phonographic correspondence. <sep><sep> In other words, we have tried to establish a Phonetic-Graphic Correspondence relationship that is as clear as possible, by taking care to create an alphabet correspondence graph and sound selection for use when speaking Creole. <sep><sep> In cases where the criteria of phonographic correspondence were not sufficient to bring clarity, it was either because it created ambiguities between readers, or because it allowed more possibilities between readers and writers. We have applied their criteria without necessarily having a hierarchy between them. <sep><sep> Among these criteria: Transparency of reading level, proximity and an intriguing graphic for users, pedagogical efficiency, using a graph that is compatible with another alphabet, and is well received by the public users. <sep><sep> Three cases of consonantlingual particularities: the groupings of consonants in the beginning and end of certain words. <sep><sep> The letter c, as we previously mentioned in another section. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even though the alphabet itself does not have any specific functions in Mauritian Creole, there are three cases that are part of its symbolic visual universe where it is necessary to use it as a distinctive sign in the alphabet. <sep><sep> For example, when we write "cd" which should not be confused with the French verb "céder", or "vcd" which should not be confused with the French "cheveux". <sep><sep> Some consonant groups in the beginning of certain words in Creole have certain possible combinations that allow them to be written either with a single consonant like "sikolozi" and "sikiat", for example, or with a group of consonants like "psikolozi" and "psikiat", for example. <sep><sep> In their case, we recommend that both be considered as variants of each other. <sep><sep> Therefore, since these words are used in very close social contexts and in rather prestigious contexts, it is suggested that when writing, the long form should be considered as a reference and the short form as a variant. <sep><sep> This means, for example, that "psikolozi" and "psikiat" should be considered as references while "sikolozi" and "sikiat" should be considered as variants. <sep><sep> Some consonant groups in the end of certain words also have some words that present the same characteristics as in their beginning, for example, "artist" could be written with or without its final "t" as "artist" or "artis", respectively. <sep><sep> We can also cite other examples like "res" or "rest", "exak" or "exakt", "tex" or "text", etc. <sep><sep> Our recommendation for this is to leave it in cases where the final sound has been established in a systematic and definitive way. We will not add it but when its establishment is not systematized in a more preferable way, it should be added especially if you find it useful for derivations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, the text "donn" gives "textiel" by derivation, "alor" gives "ki" in 'sex' gives 'sexuel', 'artist' gives 'artistique', 'exakt' gives 'exacment' etc <sep><sep> Some rules concerning other orthographic conventions concerning Mauritian Creole punctuation, weekly days and months in the language, proper names and toponyms, traditional usage and apostrophe indication, time and quantity symbols for various scientific etc. <sep><sep> Besides the letters, there are also other conventions concerning the spelling in Creole, which merit attention. <sep><sep> They concern punctuation in spelling for the days of the week and months in spelling for the designation of names of languages, proper names and toponyms, traditional usage and indication of apostrophes, time and quantity symbols for scientific sizes, etc. <sep><sep> We will present the apparent differences and rules accompanying them. <sep><sep> The punctuation system in English and in French has many similarities but there are also three small differences. <sep><sep> Due to the greater difficulty in English concerning administrative and official planning but also in the educational system, the Mauritian Grammar Harmonization proposed that the Mauritian Creole be aligned with the English punctuation system. <sep><sep> This principle has been approved by Mauritian Creole-speaking members in meetings held on Tuesday and Saturday. <sep><sep> If we apply these rules to the various aspects concerning Mauritian Creole spelling, the consequence is that we need to use capital letters for writing the days of the week, months in the year, names of languages, and names of communities. <sep><sep> For the days of the week and months in the year and the names of languages, the days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> i want to fast in february march april but i see the sun shining out september october november and december <sep><sep> languages english bhojpuri french gujarati hakka hindi cantonese creole mauritian urdu mandarin marathi tamil telugu etc <sep><sep> names of communities english french gujarati indian creole hindu marathi muslim mauritian chinese tamil telugu etc <sep><sep> attention when a term designates a language or a community it is an adjective and not a proper noun capital letters are not used <sep><sep> in this case a tilet should be used like all other adjectives in creole <sep><sep> example creole language french book text produced mauritian french etc <sep><sep> punctuation marks for punctuation marks when they are used without space comma semicolon and hyphen you need to put them together and the last letter that comes before as in english compared to french where commas and semicolons are detached and the last letter that precedes them <sep><sep> name the technical committee for mauritian creole spelling has aligned itself with the principles of graphic harmony and recommends maintaining a tradition of a thread between a noun and its definite article as in the example the boy or the girl has spoken and the lady has <sep><sep> but when the definite article is separated from its noun by one or more words we recommend the same as in graphic harmony that does not follow tradition <sep><sep> example this intelligent boy this thief who put on the red dress <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Composition is also used in construction. It is my composed action. My grandfather, my two brothers, my godfather, my guardian, the campman, the groundsman, the nurse, the steward, are all my beloved ones. <sep><sep> Mrs. Lwi is a non-resident advisor for the family of an officer. Other compositions like Sanlamour, Sidafrikin, Taxismaron, Taxi-train, Zozomaniok, etc. <sep><sep> The prefixes "ti" and "gran" are recommended for use in compositions in construction and the prefixes "ti" and "gran" are used. <sep><sep> In general, these three levels are adjectives that refer to size and shape of something, from a small item to a large item, a big house. <sep><sep> But there are cases where they have a different meaning and the meaning of your adjective given. <sep><sep> For example, in the sentence "Li toma enn tifami ar mwa", it does not refer to size or shape but to a social distance. <sep><sep> Tifami means a close family. <sep><sep> Similarly for tîpwa and gro pwa, where it is rather a variety that is highlighted rather than a size difference. <sep><sep> Yesterday, we can have constructions with a big tîpwa or a little gro pwa. <sep><sep> So in these cases, ti and gro are prefixes and not adjectives. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> like in a large family or extended family where the elders serve as a reference point for social status <sep><sep> starting with the rule of affix orthography, it is done like this; when the prefixed words are used as adjectives, there is no need for agreement <sep><sep> when they are used as prefixes, there is no agreement except in three cases where we already have physical beings like grandfather and grandmother <sep><sep> reduplication of words is a process considered by linguists as one of the lexical derivation forms, in other words, a mechanism that allows the construction of new words from existing stock that is specific and richer in the Creole language <sep><sep> reduplication is a process where a language takes a word and creates another word with it just by repeating it <sep><sep> for example, while English and French have used suffixes -ish and -âtre, respectively, to create new words from existing adjectives, this is how we have obtained "bluish," "reddish," and "greenish" from "blue," "red," and "green," respectively, and in Creole, zo t is equivalent to blue blue, rouzrouz comes from red red, and verver comes from green green <sep><sep> the spelling committee of Mauritian Creole asked which agreement rule to use to write the words that are reduplicated in Creole, either in the same form  (largelarge, smallsmall, etc.) or in simple alternating forms (marchmarch, rollroll, beatbeat, etc.) or even in complex contradictory forms  (to lift, to lower, to rise, to fall, etc.) <sep><sep> visibility of words composed of long <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Translation of the Mauritian Creole text is as follows: <sep> <sep> Traditional Mauritian Creole can also be used to separate morphological units that are part of complex structures that make up compositions that are more compact and readable <sep><sep> A washing machine and a dishwasher, for example, become simpler to decode and read when we use traditional before and after prepositions followed by a single machine washing machinewashing machinewashing machine dishwasherdishwasherdishwasher <sep><sep> Similar in the case of conjunctions like through, across, etc. <sep><sep> Easier to read if we write them as through across, etc. <sep><sep> There are exceptions that are likely determined by usage frequency where you can put a hyphen as a single unit without tradition like baitfish <sep><sep> Parameters to be considered here could be frequency of use <sep><sep> The role of an apostrophe in Creole is identical to its role in other languages, meaning it is mainly used to indicate different types of elisions that occur when certain sounds are contracted. Also to give a unique form of pronunciation <sep><sep> Examples that provide harmony: I spoke with him, she spoke with you, we were happy to see you <sep><sep> But harmony signals difficulty in the case of pronunciation contractions, for example, I am going, let's go, let's just go and it implies the need for a more in-depth study of this issue <sep><sep> To avoid unnecessary confusion, the technical committee thinks that given that contraction in pronunciation is a specific mark of oral communication, it would be preferable, as far as possible, to give a longer form in writing: let's go instead of let's go, let's come instead of let's come, he came instead of he came. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For further reflections on apostrophes, we need to look at the part that concerns the division of my <sep><sep> Treatment of proper nouns when discussing the treatment of proper nouns in the standardization process of a language, we make reference to a certain number of things like names of people being renowned and the names of families, fictional characters or public figures. You understand names of countries, cities, villages, mountains, rivers, seas, oceans, etc. <sep><sep> Names of religious holidays, etc. <sep><sep> The rules here are simple <sep><sep> Standardizing Mauritian Creole does not imply the immediate creolization of proper nouns that we have defined their use except if the creolization has already been effective as in the cases of the names of countries like Mauritius, France, England, America, Africa, Asia, the Indian Ocean, Madagascar, Seychelles, Rodrigues, etc. or in the case of religious figures and those approved by the appropriate religious authorities such as Jesus, Mary, Joseph, etc. <sep><sep> For religious texts, for example <sep><sep> Therefore, to sum up according to the general rule of local toponyms, cities, villages, mountains, rivers, seas, oceans, etc. <sep><sep> Religious holidays and characters of your religion to keep their official spelling if possible, the possibility of being creolized will continue to exist on a literary and artistic level or on unofficial bases <sep><sep> Indication of quantity, units and time, another technical problem related to the standardization of Mauritian Creole is the terms and symbols used for indicating quantity, units and time <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The terms should indicate the amount of measure and the time for the terms that indicate the amount and measure each time they create a graphic creolization without any problem between the terms. When creating your creolization, it is recommended that <sep><sep> for example the indication of the quantity of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc. <sep><sep> indication of time first or second or third or fourth: get a table in the appendix to write numbers in Mauritian Creole <sep><sep> indication of weight: gram, kilo, kilogram, ton, indication of measurement: meter, kilometre, centimetre, millimetre, foot, inch, hand span, hand, square meter, square foot, square pie, square kare, indication of time: second, minute, hour, and a half, three and a half, etc. <sep><sep> eternity: forever, for an infinitesimal moment, for a quarter of an infinitesimal moment <sep><sep> a particular area emphasized here in some cases such as area for example because they have a very technical dimension and their creolization is not necessarily standardized, we suggest you write them as you understand them at the moment and consider them as technical terms. from English, such as we have done for words like deal, delete, and save that are part of the IT jargon. <sep><sep> another particular case of terms that have been constructed from a proper noun in cases where an acronym and a measure have been constructed from a proper noun such as Celsius and Pascal, we recommend you write them as you are in your original form <sep><sep> therefore in Celsius and Pascal, the letter c should appear even if it is not supposed to exist in Creole <sep><sep> symbols to indicate quantity and measurement for symbols we keep them as they are in their original and universal form <sep><sep> we propose a summary table for the registration of these spellings <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Summary table on indications of quantity and units of measurement: 
quantity name symbol unit length centimeter millimeter kilometer m cm mm 
Mauritian Creole name abbreviations: kilogram ton kg t

quantity liter l

The result if we have no problem orally we have no problem expressing ourselves when indicating time in Creole we come to the written plan it is necessary to think carefully about how we will decline all the possibilities that the indication system allows us to do in Creole 
<sep> 
The first problem we need to solve is the very difficult problem we will write five six er six or six 
<sep> 
The second problem is the treatment of consonant clusters that we have inherited from French that we pronounce when we speak but that raise a difficulty in writing trwazer trwa zer trwazer or trwazer 
<sep> 
Reflection and recommendation after debate and discussion here is our recommendation because the indicators of quantity exist in Creole by themselves, hundred three four thousand six etc. 
It is essential that you treat it in an autonomous way when writing time 
<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What eliminates the possibility of illicit physical interactions between travelers, etc. <sep><sep> because there is a common element that we find in all occasions, even though it doesn't exist in itself in creole, it is the logic that we use as a tradition when constructing an expression with it <sep><sep> so we write "enner sinker seter" etc. <sep><sep> because the liaison consonants that we have inherited from French are used when speaking Creole, even though all of them do not mean that it is obligatory to use the tradition when writing them <sep><sep> so we write "dezer trwazer sizer" etc. <sep><sep> symbols for indicating time during use symbol for indicating time in Creole we recommend applying the same principles that have been applied here for measuring symbols, that is, aligning ourselves with universal symbols h for hour min for minute optional f for second optional a <sep><sep> m for midday p <sep><sep> summary table on indication of time main declination in minutes indication of time in the morning recurring variant h at <sep><sep> m ten in the afternoon h p <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I wake up every afternoon  <sep><sep> I get up at five thirty am <sep><sep>  indications of the year and the main principles we used to indicate the time when writing Creole apply when indicating the year and the time for the reasons that apply <sep><sep> same problems posed by tradition and with the inherited liaison consonants that have been inherited from French are explained more in detail in the section <sep><sep> the difference between  an  and  er  it exists in Creole <sep><sep> recommendation for writing, you should write the same except in cases where it is not necessary, you should not add a traditional  e when reading it, information that is given is a an eleven twelve and so on  <sep><sep> section my way of cutting up Creole words the problem of grammar harmonies is not addressed a literacy obstacle that covers areas that are much more important and simpler than questions of graphics <sep><sep> but it is important to mention some of the loopholes here because they play a role in how we write words especially if we are still in the standardization phase <sep><sep> we will discuss four aspects that are linked to this question  agglutinated ion  the treatment of long words in which the form by agglutination is used  the treatment of certain words where prepositions are used  an    the treatment of words where negation adverbs are used  pa <sep><sep> agglutination phenomenon agglutination means referring to a linguistic procedure where two words that existed separately before have now been together to form a new word <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Much of my Creole that originates from French has been shaped by this process of glottal activation, with occasional reverse transformation at the level of pronunciation <sep><sep> many of my words like "laport", "lafnet", "lame", and "lipie" have been formed through the process of glottal activation, which has allowed each time for my French sounds to come together and give birth to a new word like "laporte", "lafenêtre", "lamain", and "lepied" with transformation in pronunciation respectively <sep><sep> it is important when we write in Creole that we respect the results of this glottal activation process and not continue to write as it was in its original language because it has become a completely different language <sep><sep> for example, "lakaz" should not be written as "la case" or "pir" as "la cage" in Creole on the pretext that it comes from French <sep><sep> because "la case" in French means a small cabin, whereas "cabane" in French means hut, and "la cage" means a small house for animals, while "cage" means a cage, hoop, or hutch <sep><sep> on the other hand, "lakaz" is equivalent to what the French call "maison", which means house or home, a place where people live <sep><sep> long words or compound words formed by agglutination in the process of agglutination can also create a problem of readability when writing, if the words exceed a certain length <sep><sep> for instance, words like "anvwadfami" (in waves family), "deplizanpli" (more and more), "detanz" (distance), among others <sep><sep> for this reason, we have already recommended using traditions for these words whenever possible to have appliances in the place of appliances and mop in the place of mop <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> but it is not systematic and we have to accept the deal as well with those long mori<sep><sep> in the same context when we are standardizing Mauritian Creole in writing there are many elements that will emerge and seem new even if on the oral level we were already using them<sep><sep> let's take a case of every<sep><sep> so all in all it does not appear as one word in itself<sep><sep> especially if we are comparing examples like every day or all the time that appear as one word<sep><sep> but as we start including it in all its functional and grammatical dimensions every day every five days every weekend every end of the week we have to rethink our position<sep><sep> otherwise we risk finding ourselves with an<sep><sep>extra long span like every end of the week or every three seconds<sep><sep> so in these cases every must be treated as one word<sep><sep> with a slightly higher degree the same principle can be applied to all <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> for example during all night and all day <sep><sep> during all week and all year on the other hand possibility exists to introduce tradition or simply not you have all throughout your life to have everything throughout your life for this <sep><sep> it is preferred to make it for beautiful in to separate morphemes that compose speech <sep><sep> treatment of words like and by preposition in <sep><sep> we are taking here the three reflections that have already been discussed in the introduction of the Mauritian dictionary <sep><sep> it is just a small problem of division of my but it allows to understand the problem a little <sep><sep> in creole when an is found in front of a word it is often possible to treat it as a preposition that comes before a noun like below in front in detail in flower etc <sep><sep> but it is also possible to consider it as an element that is part of the noun itself below in front in detail in flower etc <sep><sep> according to the process of agglutination more detailed explanation <sep><sep> when a phonetic sequence that comes after an are as sound in another problem poses a concern for this false pronunciation <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> for example there is a risk that certain sounds are pronounced incorrectly and in advance as well as in reverse as in the case of analfabet, analtiz, and anatomik instead of how they should be pronounced <sep><sep> therefore the temptation exists to treat them as separate words <sep><sep> but such application cannot be done in a systematic way because in certain cases there has already been a fusion between an and mo and I follow suit with it <sep><sep> under and also for example functions much better as adverbs and pronouns rather than as prepositions in Mauritian Creole, rather than as separate entities <sep><sep> there is another issue <sep><sep> in creole there is a tendency for certain words starting with an to be written separately but the sequences that come after it exist only in a form where it is preceded by an and never all together as in anrivann, antandan, and so on <sep><sep> if we write them separately there is an issue posed in the classification of the second item in the inventory of words in a sense that they do not exist all together <sep><sep> in another scenario if you write zot kouma enselmo there is a pronunciation problem that we encountered just now with an at the beginning of sequences after an starting with a vowel a <sep><sep> for this reason it becomes necessary sometimes to use a hyphen to identify certain sounds that allow at the same time to solve pronunciation problems and present them in a form where two syllables are integrated anarivan, anatandan, anarzan, etc <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But in other cases when it is already obvious that in the way people use their money has been fully integrated and that meanwhile they have no issue with the pronunciation they must be treated like my auntie does out of the three below under so on etc <sep><sep> treatment of words like using adverbs of negation is not a problem that arises with the negation adverb not it is quite similar whenever it falls into a combination with another item not want to not there are not yet and where both are debossed on a short-form conjugated form <sep><sep> if in terms of pronunciation this abbreviated form does not raise serious problems the question arises as to how to write it <sep><sep> the principle that has been retained by Mauritian creole in reunion that has been established since Tuesday is a decision to recommend the full form of these expressions whenever they are written rather than their contracted form which is part of the oral universe to highlight that students understand the functioning of the underlying constructions before they write it in their contracted form <sep><sep> but if you need to write the contracted form for example when transcribing an oral discourse it is good to know which option to use <sep><sep> there are two options presented here to use an apostrophe or not <sep><sep> for example not want can become want speak or speak not want can become do not have or not have not want can become yet or yet not <sep><sep> which option to choose in each of these cases there are criteria that we give you to determine whether you are one of them statistical or logical <sep><sep> whenever according to our analysis the abbreviated form appears more frequently than its long version in common usage for Mauritians we have chosen not to use apostrophes and instead <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> there is no <sep><sep> every time a long form seems more dominant than its short form in usage by Mauritians we have chosen to include an apostrophe ex <sep><sep> there is no <sep><sep> but logical criteria also has its importance <sep><sep> there are no homonyms in Mauritian Creole so there is a possibility that confusion on this level does not exist <sep><sep> on the other hand, there have been examples of homonyms in Creole <sep><sep> therefore, when we use an apostrophe to write "there is no" and "you don't want to speak" we are contributing to reducing the risk of confusion <sep><sep> the same principle applies to other words found in the same situation <sep><sep> but once again, the recommended principle here is to use the full form when writing and not the short form which means that the short form should not yet be favored in writing instead of <sep> <batch_sep>
