For terms indicating quantity and measurement, whenever Creole graphics do not pose any problems in construction, Creolization is recommended.

For example:
- Quantity indication: one, two, three, four, five, half (-edmi), a quarter, three quarters, a fifth, a tenth, a quarter, a fifth, etc.
- Location or order indication: first, second/second, third; Refer to the table in the Appendix for writing numbers in Mauritian Creole.
- Weight indication: gram, ounce, kilo, kilogram, ton;
- Measurement indication: meter, kilometer, centimeter, millimeter, inch, foot, yard, meter square, square foot;
- Time indication: second, minute, hour (one hour, two hours, three hours, etc.), hour-and-a-half/hour, hour-and-a-half (an hour-and-a-half, two-and-a-half hours, three-and-a-half hours).

A particular case: area (pronounced [e:rja]) In some cases, such as area, because they have a very technical dimension and their Creolization is not yet necessarily regulated (erya? sipe rfisi?), we suggest writing them as they are at the moment, and considering them as technical terms taken from English, just as we have done for words like deal, delete, and save that are part of computer jargon (see the section. 

Another specific case: terms constructed from proper nouns In cases where an initial and a measure are constructed from a proper noun, such as Celsius and Pascal, we recommend writing them as they are in their original form.

Therefore, in Celsius and Pascal, the letter C should be used even if it is not supposed to exist in Creole.
