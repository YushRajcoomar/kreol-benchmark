<batch_sep> <sep> In its beginnings, while at the same time, facing a great movement, it was a challenge to imperialism and colonialism. <sep><sep> On the LALIT side, we encountered great difficulties in finding ways to intervene. <sep><sep> They always differ, they always see what they need to criticize in MMM first. <sep><sep> On the political side, there has been a lot of excitement about the pressure of this great economic crisis. <sep><sep> Licensees more easily, and a strong production unit when it wants to without having to account for it. <sep><sep> There is nothing more democratic than "The Founding Document of the American Constitution". <sep><sep> Some sectors are functioning quite well, but expansion is very difficult. <sep><sep> In these last 6-7 months, we have found continued union movements divided. <sep><sep> If we cannot really understand these different levels - which we are discussing - we will have difficulty in intervening. <sep><sep> When we look at the context of Dulloo's dismissal, we find that there is still a possible partial role in Ashok Jugnauth's constituency. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I believe that we all here follow the news, watch the latest news on television, and discuss work and chat with friends, we are all well aware that today in the world there is a very serious crisis. <sep><sep> 'When will you become independent?' - 'We are waiting for you to take power.' <sep><sep> Now Seychellois people are telling us to return to Mauritius. <sep><sep> Lalit is proposing to mobilize people on the basis of demands that will allow us to get out of this "economic catastrophe" where we are now, and to move towards a true democratic and socialist transformation of our economy. <sep><sep> It had gone down a very dark road. <sep><sep> He hopes that the organization will expand to cover not only the Salfit region but also other regions. <sep><sep> Listeners are debating, we are crying, children. <sep><sep> And the workers of the world must organize as a class to take possession of the means of production, to abolish the work system for a peaceful and harmonious life on earth. <sep><sep> He uses this issue to proclaim himself as a monarch. <sep><sep> What the Worker's party has, it will share, it will share with its partner in the Government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sithanen continues to anchor capitalism in its 4 corners with a business exposing slavery and Morisyan nationality, its offshore, its frozen turism. <sep><sep> When he put something in his head no one could pull it out. <sep><sep> With these big industries that developed in Lerop, and maybe more advanced than Langleter, we have gained a consciousness of the upper class. <sep><sep> 4 candidates per constituency, he arrives with 84 seats in 21 constituencies. <sep><sep> In other words, the lawyer managed to expose that different mansions are not crumbling. <sep><sep> like "Is neo-liberalism bringing progress to humanity?", or "Is it our historical responsibility to use Diego Garcia to torture illegal prisoners?". <sep><sep> He took fundamental rights, that each of us, all Mauritians receive the same treatment that we are a nation, and made it “means-tested”; the Government created 2 different classes of citizens: <sep><sep> The last time Tras played, he played in Moris. <sep><sep> The crisis in the security industry results directly from the application of WTO regulations. <sep><sep> This can prevent potential development, psychological, in terms of identity, in work and democratic participation in a society." So, this means that you are committing linguistic genocide in a 2nd way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He talked in detail about the different responsibilities of a political party. <sep><sep> He believed that he would succeed in doing what others could not do; that he could mobilize his troops and lead them towards a better life. <sep><sep> Any hesitations, which previously made him seem hesitant, were disappearing bit by bit and he was gaining more confidence in himself. <sep><sep> From 2007, the financial crisis and global recession worsened the situation for the textile and tourism sectors. <sep><sep> It is immoral to decree that a Marine Park be established on land and sea belonging to other people. <sep><sep> We in LALIT are contributing towards the development of this socialist alternative program. <sep><sep> When we started our campaign, everyone thought that 'Larzan Lerop', money for Mister Tablisman, and nothing else. <sep><sep> LALIT organized a conference on Wednesday 22nd November 2006, GRNW. <sep><sep> We can also say that by the time the Government created the National Human Rights Committee (in 2001, seven years later). <sep><sep> We, we have to learn from these lessons. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even in France, small-scale farmers from the peasant association, led by José Bové, have started to resist against the effects of globalization. <sep><sep>Firstly, we need to compel the State to make capitalists invest where there is job creation, so that everyone has at least a place to work. <sep><sep> In Australia, on November 11 at 5.00 p.m., there was a demonstration in Sydney. <sep><sep> But as he was very ill, he delegated responsibilities to several ministers under the responsibility of his deputy, who was called Baron Toupoumwa, his own step-brother. <sep><sep> Now, it's clear that 75% of this money comes from the EU, and only 25% from the establishment. <sep><sep> All this to say that when job positions in the cane and sugar sector went from 55,000 to 3,500, job positions in France went from 110,000 to 55,000. <sep><sep> A systemic crisis means a crisis that is not cyclical (capitalist system, it thrives on regular crises, which bring it back to its reality). <sep><sep> All these federations cannot, as long as they remain separate, help to bring union peace and develop class-specific unity. <sep><sep> It was one of the most beautiful demonstrations we ever organized. <sep><sep> According to the law, if this limit is exceeded, then the USA would enter a “partial default”, in English a “debt default”. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, he went to make them a visit to different places where they were being operated on. <sep><sep> Conferences are being held at Orl Mama Bul Later, LPT, Great North West River, Port Louis. <sep><sep> These newspapers represent the interests of other bourgeoisie and bourgeois sections as well. <sep><sep> LALIT has also supported the demand for the police to have a union. <sep><sep> Often, if you get it right that way, then you'll realize the kind of democracy we have today, why our level of LALIT we call it a "bourgeois democracy" and not a true democracy? <sep><sep> "There is too much wastage, corruption," or, as some have gone so far as to say, "a massacre and a demand." <sep><sep> - You're not trying to make politics, are you? Camla said he would try it. <sep><sep> Yesterday Paris VIII University served as our research website. <sep><sep> In the last budget speech, when there was a Euro crisis, he said we needed to, economically speaking, look towards the Far East, towards the BRICS. <sep><sep> You can create a perception that everyone is on the same boat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the conference, among others, they adopted a resolution to support the demands and movements of workers coming from the Southern African region. <sep><sep> There should be no discrimination based on race / poverty. <sep><sep> Among the DSP members that Ram met in Perth, there were Sam Wainwright and Janet Parker. <sep><sep> Why not have the right to keep the minutes of the association in Creole? <sep><sep> Amidst accelerated depreciation and a rapid rise in prices, the reduced price that was there is quickly disappearing. <sep><sep> Linzi Bacbotte, dressed in an extravagant style similar to Bette Midler (creation by Florence Drachsler) felt terribly out of place just like Caroline Auckbarallee Jodhun felt with a chance - even if they felt the numbers were not easy to understand. <sep><sep> We express our concern about the "reconciliation" that is enshrined in the Sex Discrimination Act, for offenses of arson and other criminal offenses. <sep><sep> This program of the directions is marching along with a program for the strength of the Government and other establishments to stand still and stop driving people away! <sep><sep> The bank gave loans, Mechanical Pool borrowed a car, and the sugar cane plantations were given tax relief. <sep><sep> And, if he is ever found guilty of a crime, his seat will break again. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this systemic crisis in Mauritius, with one crisis after another, has had devastating effects on Mauritian society. <sep><sep> If you work hard every day, you can never afford to buy a Mercedes and go home! <sep><sep> but the sugarcane plantations have gradually closed down with the permission of the bourgeois and capitalist parties, one after the other. <sep><sep> This country has opened up its doors to the sea, which Israel claims to control (illegally) and to international waterways. <sep><sep> It did this to encourage people to read Marx in its original form. <sep><sep> to a politics of building scientific knowledge on knowledge and experiences that have been accumulated over a long period. <sep><sep> We need a Program – today – a program that creates a map that interprets the signals indicating how to get out of this disaster that is coming, how to stop turning backward in pro-capitalist historical blocks, and how to advance towards a new kind of society. <sep><sep> Finally, when everyone, even the police, says their heads are no good, then they change the date, they put it forward, to the 10th. <sep><sep> The Residents who have received notices are meeting and sending a delegation to meet the Minister of Law and Order this week. <sep><sep> It's moments like these, in a serious crisis, when people are beginning to realize the importance of the statements that LALIT puts on the table between worker and capitalist classes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The relationship between religion and Mauritianism where they are located with independence, do we have an “independence with religion”? <sep><sep> Sometimes words are plenty, but actions on the ground are lacking. <sep><sep> Bukharin, the child of the Russian revolution, and the greatest theorist of that time continued the work of Marx until 1930. <sep><sep> They used iron bars to break down the gate to enter. <sep><sep> If a worker has achieved what they have achieved today, public opinion, working conditions, trade union rights, have become a matter of political loyalty on an international level, as well as on a national level. <sep><sep> The largest street demonstration, and its significance in history This phase culminated when 100 - 200 families descended into the streets in Port Louis, shouting slogans 'Return our Diego', 'Close the base, go away', 'What are we looking for? Diego!' <sep><sep> 14th August 2011 - Navin Ramgoolam files a complaint against Berenger for "diffusing false news". <sep><sep> In some poor countries, true intellectuals were continuing to seek solutions. <sep><sep> The world is not running smoothly today, and it is clear that there is a hand of Lon in it. <sep><sep> We do not agree with this policy to CEB to guarantee the profitability of IPP against all carbon price increases; against CPI sanctions, rupee depreciation, and elsewhere making workers and ordinary people bear the burden of the energy crisis through price increases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And what happened this evening on the 23rd, despite the fact that the Lalit de Klas militants were well organized, we did not have the political strength to consolidate the success of the strike. <sep>
<sep> We already know that the "working people on the democratization of the economy" slogan is only meant to address the economic crisis to force historic concessions and share control of the economy with the new bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> We needed a lot of political punishment on the Diego issue this year, and LALIT has succeeded in making them think through the Commission. <sep>
<sep> All of this should give us more determination to succeed in our struggle. <sep>
<sep> The press must admit that they have put the economy in jeopardy. <sep>
<sep> All children must learn to read and write otherwise they will not know how to do it. <sep>
<sep> Following a press conference, LALIT sent a letter to Minister Gokhool, former Minister Steve Obeegadoo, and Archbishop Piat to present them with a copy of our program. <sep>
<sep> * Put the emphasis on the production and processing of food on a large scale. <sep>
<sep> And now it seems to have rained from the sky since it last took action in front of Parliament. <sep>
<sep> However, we are allowing the government to re-rationalize the man by giving him starchy food, rather than forcing him to diversify and create jobs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During training, the MSM had so much financing from commercial capital (all the shops) and capital in transportation (trucks) and doesn't know where this funding came from yet, which has caused its Sun Trust to become a fortune for the Jugnauth family for their political career. <sep><sep> Because their love was so strong they could have created a society that had not yet been ready to accept people who think differently. <sep><sep> Then, gradually, it portrayed PMSD as a junior partner representing the oligarchy. <sep><sep> I welcome Wilbert van der Zeijden, (Says "hi", to applause). <sep><sep> When we look at working conditions, there are several laws and factors that determine working conditions. <sep><sep> They try to disguise the true problems of imperialist piracy that fuel conflict. <sep><sep> And no rights that the Ut 79 strike questions, flat out question, capitalist system. <sep><sep> Is the time ripe for a new sun to rise? Will they be there to see it happen? Often these ideas, such as this one, were spread to muddy the waters. <sep><sep> They were replaced by many stronger forces, which are convincing people to try to create a life for themselves. <sep><sep> Some people have persisted in trying to make people believe that these are the 2 things themselves. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The dollar guard system, like reserve, has been operating for a very long time without anyone believing in it. <sep> <sep> And as the Party learns, it retains its program at the same time and may gain more influence. <sep> <sep> In Lalit, we have consistently supported the struggle for Palestinian liberation. <sep> <sep> CAN WE FORGET THE ROLE OF BERENGER IN ABOLISHING COMPENSATION. <sep> <sep> When there was a decision to be made, he called his ministers, let them make the decision. <sep> <sep> So, we have started a genuinely communal-religious organization and a genuinely communal political party in the trade union movement. <sep> <sep> He had also directly from lamars against the axe on a day. <sep> <sep> on the other hand, a parliamentary limb next to the presidency of the former speaker, elect a new speaker. <sep> <sep> The main objective is the education of children with a focus on Early Childhood Development (ECD). <sep> <sep> And I do not have the right to work for a second more, no more. <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, recently Nad Sivaramen has been appointed as the Editor-in-Chief of all publications of the La Sentinelle group. <sep>At that time, it was a follow-up to Ragini in 2004. <sep> This economic blockade was presented as a common economic blockade. <sep> And, this same media (Rupert Murdoch group) has almost acted as a "king-maker", deciding who the Prime Minister should be in England. <sep> People's "common profile" will determine whether they can become Prime Minister or President. <sep> All this shows that with the use of GMOs, the risk of hunger will increase. <sep> It seems that the enemy, enemy of the working class also took advantage of the capitalist ideology of this phonetic logic. <sep> When I passed by Um F, his children told me that he was still in Nablus. <sep> Then, in this case, there will be no place for PMSD in the government. <sep> In relation to what comrade Kreepalloo has raised, I believe that planting sugar cane in Mauritius is an extraordinary example of the class struggle because sugar cane planters have had to fight against injustices throughout their existence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>We have shared the dates for the year-end holidays, and will start in 2013. <sep><sep> 7. Ideological brainwashing by media especially media controlled by multinational capitalists and the advertising industry. <sep><sep> I believe all these men are the same, he thought. <sep><sep> We did work at Sart (a 20th organization has contributed and educated) to speak in Creole most of the year we had our International Hearing with all its positive feedback. <sep><sep> Clearly there are no solid proposals since MMM, as some media outlets have reported. <sep><sep> Our campaign has aimed to criticize the Government's policies and at the same time put forward demands that have the potential to bring about minimal competition and bring more equality among colleagues and reorganize at a higher level in general. <sep><sep> At the same time, the union work that RA does, be it in leisure, transportation, the Security Industry, creates a problem that unionists call "breakdown", that is, RA marches on the platforms with its comrades in other unions, or at another federation. <sep><sep> In fact, here it seems that all MMM and MSM have been equally affected. <sep><sep> When we look at the international level situation, we do not pretend that we will bring peace and a single cue for change. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee said we are living in a social and communal climate that is degrading day by day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT accused the main political parties of fraud and communalism in this election, accusing them of reducing the campaign to a power struggle and avoiding all debates on the devastating crises of capitalist economics. <sep><sep> But, its values ​​stand out, even converting some. <sep><sep> LALIT has already committed to this kind of action with pleasure in organizations in Mauritius and at an international level. <sep><sep> There are Workers struggling to make ends meet. <sep><sep> In the last 5-6 years, there are certain identity organizations that have raised their voice for the first time in favor of the Creole language, on a community basis. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie develops in a dialectical contradiction, in classes that are becoming bourgeoisie themselves and share the same interests as historical bourgeoisies, as they support each other. <sep><sep> Listen to the old story of Uncle Toulsi, who loved to tell stories long ago in a place where people gathered a mountain on their heads and diverted it, it was becoming true. <sep><sep> There is another person waiting for his delivery as well. <sep><sep> - Physical and psychological violence against children who grew up and lived with misery (like a prison) <sep><sep> Edna narrated how she lived that painful moment when the British Government expelled people who were living a peaceful life on the Chagos archipelago to make way for an American military base <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The capitalist class and the bourgeois state in its financial sense. <sep><sep> Where its service is its life is not as good as it is, promoting "lifestyles" that prioritize material wealth, using children in advertisements, making advertisements that promote anti-family ideologies in a thousand ways, glorifying a necrophilic culture. <sep><sep> That is why it is very important that this program you must criticize it, you must convince union leaders. <sep><sep> Meaning that it has long been absent, but it did. <sep><sep> Everywhere in the galaxy there was a forum, a hostel, a tavern, a conference, a workshop for this event to take place almost everywhere. <sep><sep> Once again we notice that the media chooses to focus attention on the process of childbirth. <sep><sep> They were all developed in a scuffle between branches and meeting programs. <sep><sep> Berenger just pulled out a small boat in an election, his first thing is that there must be a communal reaction. <sep><sep> By pretending he feels weak, convincing, he is acting by using more repression and threatening language against those who oppose his policies. <sep><sep> We said we would make banners on paper a little thin so that we could fold the banner, hide it under our sheets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, this blockaded bourgeoisie feels it doesn't receive the same "favours" from the State that it believes the Indo-Mauritian bourgeoisie benefits from. <sep><sep> Furthermore, we are learning to use our participation in media programs to popularize our program and our politics. <sep><sep> It is clear that it is the military installations that form their base. <sep><sep> For a long time Balram stopped feeling alive in his cocoon, little by little when the time allowed him, he would like to break out into the mud. <sep><sep> More than a week has passed since the petition was copied, but until now there has been no response. <sep><sep> That is why working-class must understand international politics and develop their own capacity for criticizing their country's diplomatic policies, and to confront this political situation in practice today. <sep><sep> They even put their tears into bottles and were selling them like sweet-cake frosts with those putting the bottles beside the statue of the gods because they had magical powers according to publicity. <sep><sep> Many experiences were classified over the years, followed by youth after years. <sep><sep> "This means a space where there are disfigurements under the bright daylight and a dark atmosphere to darken the offset camera development and turn white, and then get stored under a vinyl parasol," commented Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> Daneswar Boobun, who chaired the Forum-Debate, provided details on our campaign that started before the last general elections and continues through a series of forums that we are holding across Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the island, where tourists go, during the last 3 weeks, you can have 5, 10, 15, or more meetings everyday. <sep> He did the same thing in the 1970s, through his bourgeois ideology, in the bourgeois press. <sep> The main issue, and the deportation of the Chagossians, is there because they wanted to establish a base. <sep> in the last 10 years, all the parties in these two alliances have been complicit in maintaining the IRA law that prevents unions and workers from claiming their rights. <sep> Therefore, sometimes a union brings an analysis, it brings debate, but that doesn't mean it is effective. <sep> In the end, the world is raising its voice to condemn President Bush for his irresponsibility in continuing to protect the big oil interests that are causing more destruction to our planet. <sep> With this latest law by Minister Varma on Legal Aid, it seems to be open to abuse and police brutality. <sep> It already represents a great progress in the field of education given that the French Department at the University of Mauritius is offering "Creole studies" as an elective in the BA French program. <sep> Not only Minister Sithanen and Boolell, but the entire Labour Party is supporting and has been supporting capitalist globalization. <sep> But they will continue to fight to regain Chagos entirely because they are definitively against military bases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Senior brother is wet, junior brother wet without power, without power wet lazy, man wet hungry. <sep><sep> They created a Food Security Fund of 2 billion rupees, but most of it has already been disbursed. <sep><sep> It becomes a part of our political program that we share, that we discuss, and that together all members of our collective can do, and it is our duty to share it outside the party and to develop it further. <sep><sep> Route 443 connects Tel Aviv to East Jerusalem and passes through the West Bank but is reserved only for Israelis. <sep><sep> Today the military base on Diego is becoming a main base: it serves the new phase of global capitalistic destruction on the example of the United States. <sep><sep> The government is coming back with a plan to give certainty to the Security Industry instead of planning a development strategy based on agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> And big NGOs like Oxfam, Greenpeace, and others have masterminded this "social forum," and they have strictly forbidden political party participation. <sep><sep> It circulates internationally a document describing the Chagos demand. <sep><sep> The real power lies within the Ministry of Finance, and it acts in the interest of the bourgeoisie (that is, capital owners). <sep><sep> The budget also shows a State increasing its repressive nature while social inequalities are on the rise: 900 new guards, more surveillance cameras at every street corner, and a new electronic identity card. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The currency needs to be restored with the Central Bank to reduce the depreciation of the Rupee! <sep><sep> This dependence on tourism, IRS or Mauritius as a destination shopping makes us vulnerable, if there is an economic crisis in other countries. <sep><sep> There was no distinction between different sizes as there is today. <sep><sep> The National Assembly does not even know." It explains that the Minister of International Trade has officers who work in Geneva, Switzerland, called "Trade Negotiators." <sep><sep> They took control, often as if they had completely moved the relics, but then they put them in a corner of a tapestry, a small ceremony for birth, marriage, death. <sep><sep> This also satisfies some fairly common people, who have such a claim. <sep><sep> Comrade Lindsey Collen went to Ecuador where she created the anti-base movement (No Bases) and there were also demonstrations to close the Manta base, an American military base, which finally succeeded in closing. <sep><sep> in branches, in the LALIT Commission, during actions on different campaigns, through Revi, when distributing leaflets, holding meetings. <sep><sep> In the 1960s, the leaders of the Mauritian Rally (which later became the Mauritian Party and then PMSD) used 'Mauritian' to distinguish between what they called 'true Mauritians'. <sep><sep> to then use them as a common strike force, but behind a clearly pro-capitalist ideology. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And naturally, things have become even more dangerous because the Government has withdrawn all regulations that were acting as a security guard, preventing this kind of "melt-down" from happening in the past. <sep><sep> The Workers' Party, on the other hand, has come up with a program of "democratizing the economy for the workers," favoring a petite-bourgeoisie/bourgeoisie who wants to climb up the economic ladder to share control of the economy with the big bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> And it has analyzed, beneath all this hustle and bustle, the useless and unnecessary drama that is happening on the political scene, where different social classes, especially Workers, MSM, and MMM are represented. <sep><sep> In many countries, this has sparked major movements of protest. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is the case of Thierry Lagesse, former CEO of the Mon Loisir group, facing allegations of tax evasion on lottery winnings. <sep><sep> There has been a backlash against Berenger regarding the Metro dossier involving Minister Baichoo. <sep><sep> It is highlighted that Creole and Bhojpuri languages are considered inferior, stemming from colonial times when the colonizers and their academies, their civil services. <sep><sep> Jericho residents were considered as sex-workers without wages and merely a machine to produce cheap labor, and the majority of them unfortunately saw this as normal. <sep><sep> Prof. Mike Cole is an expert in "equality" in education, meaning that at the same time teachers in schools (from primary to university) can learn to apply more equality in classrooms nowadays. <sep><sep> On the 27th of January 1990, a total reversal in the Mauritian State's positions occurred. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is also the possibility to develop farms that harness solar energy to increase production on a large scale. <sep><sep> Another more political and social issue is the repression of the mother tongue which hinders children from developing their reflective capacity. <sep><sep> 1. How has the Euro (accompanying company) been used to restrict the economy, particularly the security industry? <sep><sep> Now they are trying to make us pay for their crisis and are trying to make the working class carry the burden of this crisis! <sep><sep> Today everyone knows where the millions that they all owe to the Alliance are coming from. <sep><sep> They have a tendency to favor the Creole language, which we never thought possible. <sep><sep> And finally, a political party is a political party because it is committed to concretizing its program. <sep><sep> Even if 90% of people easily recognize that "they are all equal", the working class has not yet reached the realization that its mind and necessary actions are needed to bring about the punishment it desires. <sep><sep> When we meet, we have shared folded posters, mockingly, among the present women. <sep><sep> This will make a diversified agriculture program much more difficult in the medium term. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before you cast your vote, you can sit down in the court with them. And it has done the same until now. Have you ever heard, when speaking of "fundamental rights", when found in the press, in democratic countries, in France French are writing Commissioner for a vote?<sep> Rajni Lallah, who was presiding over the meeting, explained how Lalit activists started together.<sep> We invite everyone interested in giving us a hand in this work to contact our members.<sep> Here, we get big bags like Pick 'n Pay, or Shoprite filling up shops in the main street, big bags replacing local baskets.<sep> There is already a law that makes it easier for workers to obtain licenses, which allows the employer to increase his profit margin by paying less overtime for the same amount of work.<sep> In the year that has just passed, we found a union movement that continues to fragment and weaken.<sep> Individuals in different industries are gaining new strength directly from the ground, directly from the workplace, all members are analyzing a situation together, and understanding it based on this, and then assessing it.<sep> In the past, they were getting something called Representational Status, they were able to negotiate for their members, but they were not allowed to sign an agreement with the employer that would be binding for everyone.<sep> Alain Ah-Vee has already gone on a visit.<sep> In addition, MMM-MSM documents are clearly stating that it is going to put PPP in the health, education and training sectors at risk (meaning that the hospital is also at risk of falling under capitalist control, which then imposes fees on the public either through insurance or direct payments from. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the working class weakens, divides, and is unable to offer resistance, this creates conditions for the bourgeoisie to impose its control through privatization. <sep><sep> What kind of platform today will rally all the forces of resistance to end the military occupation by Israel? <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen has explained step by step the demands in the petition. <sep><sep> The 4 Traitors and other opposing forces abandoned the strike, meaning the forces within the workers' movement that were against the strike. <sep><sep> Here we are tonight on November 26 at the MGI. <sep><sep> In 1979, faced with the rupee devaluation, an economic crisis, we find MMM representing a force outside along with the trade unions, which had just come out of a major workers' movement, the biggest challenge to capitalist rule that had been seen. <sep><sep> It seemed to be the integrationists and anti-Americans who had done this because Bhutto, everyone saw him as an agent of the UK and US sent to raise the voice of the integrationists. <sep><sep> But, if today we go back to the beginnings and say on the platforms, "Let's make a dime revolution!" workers will believe we have run out of gas. <sep><sep> After the 2000 elections, the MMM-MSM government had the Sachs report which it had commissioned, followed by the Seleka Committee report with the MMM option (Collendavelloo report) and the MSM option (Leung Shing report). <sep><sep> For the working class and poor people, democratizing the economy does not amount to much. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The political issues on the ground are shifting to find resolution at the administrative level. <sep><sep> However, because it has been introduced alongside what used to be called "ancestral language," even if this terminology is no longer used, when work of the AKM's caliber comes to the forefront (after spelling and grammar had already settled down), they raise a red flag. <sep><sep> We may suffer from food insecurity, and are we lacking access to water? <sep><sep> We found it to be a stepping stone for the United Nations to reach this stage. <sep><sep> Certainly, there has been a trend since the 1970s in the sugar industry and the French zone, today there are new trends emerging in those two sectors, as well as in transport, ICT, and construction. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, certain unions, like CEB for example, have incredible conditions. <sep><sep> For pharmaceutical production, Maurel for lubricant - just to name a few. <sep><sep> There are about 9-10 people who are ready to sacrifice their lives. <sep><sep> "Language" is a capacity in our genetic heritage that allows global representation outside of ourselves, we think in our minds, and we feel inside, all that is within us we serve. <sep><sep> Andersen is pursuing it through their local essence, De Chazal Du Mee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 2 Finns were given concessions in the Income Tax to plant sugarcane. <sep><sep> But, this is one of the difficulties when, for example, you try to start a revolution to transform society, or if you try to start a revolution, the main

return to the bustling city streets of Montagn Pous, where the clash between civilization and nature, like two calabashes, was ongoing, each one trying to outdo the other. <sep><sep> In MASA, there was a situation where the edge of the abyss was almost reached, including its President, who resigned. <sep><sep> And so, it is important for us to understand the Labour Party, especially to

southern direction. <sep><sep> However, there is always this right that has never been put into law, which states that the true value of the work must be recognized. <sep><sep> There are many other reasons why this year is special. <sep><sep> Rama Poonoosamy said that this might be the first time a Mauritian's work is being betrayed in so many languages. <sep><sep> Demonstrators are advocating

things when a big defender like Best Loser, Youssouf Mohamed, said that when he studied the Balancy verdict carefully, he is not happy that they have not fixed the Best Loser anomaly. <sep><sep> They did this at a time where they managed to cover all of LALIT's meetings (which were a success), its track record (also a success), press conferences and door-to-door campaigns (another success).

in Beau Songe with Kaya when Kaya died. <sep><sep> And when the European Union is compensating, Lalit says the money should not be given to the establishment. <sep><sep> Through a unionist way, as Comrade Reeaz said yesterday, a union is only there to solve immediate problems. <sep><sep> IN REALITY, WHAT CONTRIBUTION DO YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE IN THEIR PARTY AND IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM? <sep><sep> Another factor that has entered into the current flow of history: the civil case. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Shortly after the end of the "fight inflation with sermons" campaign, the newspaper L’Express, the MCB- establishment voice, came out with a big headline on page 1: "Bagasse: An underutilized potential". <sep><sep> If you, in your ignorance, are absent, you are not sick either, we will make you leave. <sep><sep> Today there are people who are always working in this sense as well, but we are not talking "work" in this sense. <sep><sep> it is a bank, a bank invested in a banking group based in Oxford, England. <sep><sep> LALIT has also supported the demand for police for their union. <sep><sep> Only with a grassroots foundation has given a boost in North Africa, Latin America, Middle Eastern, India, Latin America, Greece, Spain, England, everywhere. <sep><sep> Lindsay Riviere says that the question of electoral reform is somewhat secondary and that the real issue is how the MMM and Labour parties can share power. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin continued: After all the reports, we will have a debate on how the parties in general have been in 2008, and what we have missed. <sep><sep> You may have either a strong class conscience that prevails, or a strong communal conscience that prevails. <sep><sep> We may not have focused enough on the difficulties in the past, we have not focused on the issues to understand how to bring about a better future. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some consider some to be "true Mauritians" and others to be "false" Mauritians! <sep> <sep> This general context means that it is important to sway and have strict discipline (branches, commissions, publications, program meetings). <sep> <sep> But, as Alain Ah-Vee said, the fact that we had 62,000 visitors on our site relativizes the boycott of MBC and the press. <sep> <sep> Coming together in a democratic way to look at how the economy is organized - its labor, its capital, its production. <sep> <sep> So, they decided to launch a "New Series" and they called it "Number One", and they put forth their invented falsehoods as the greatest peace treaty. <sep> <sep> Lalit says that this subscription needs to have its deputy to replace Siddick Chaddy and has also denounced government tricks. <sep> <sep> This means converting the sugar cane farm and its infrastructure, to become a united modern agro-industrial production, aiming to preserve and transform food (canning, livestock production, freeze-drying, processing, etc) which plant, breed, fish supply for example. <sep> <sep> And this Advance Group that will soon take leadership of the Labour Party, was in opposition to the true founders of Labour, namely people like Rozemont, Anquetil, Cure. <sep> <sep> The Sanatan Dharma Federation has brought together communal and religious societies from all sides, in a second line of support for the Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> And this has led to the establishment of a basic program for all Lalit based on the Chagos issue, which has contributed to progress, up to the present day in 2002. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I have given an example of how our political program works. <sep><sep> A small regional newspaper wrote an editorial to say that the financial burden of controlling irrigation, production, and distribution was high without much return compared to the money coming in. <sep><sep> On the other hand, we are seeing reactions from communal-religious organizations. <sep><sep> We are affected by a funny kind of work that some of our branch members have to do. <sep><sep> And considering what LALIT has been saying since before the general elections, it is now becoming public. <sep><sep> During a press conference with the MBC, comrade Ram Seegobin showed a case in which there were 4 squares of land, each with the name of the community that each candidate is supposed to declare. <sep><sep> We are everywhere in politics, in every forum, in every corner. <sep><sep> In places like Morcellement and Bagatelle, etc., a series of magazines are also closing down. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister, like all politicians, takes the opportunity to assert his authority. <sep><sep> He goes where the phone is to try to get his own way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> White Paper MMM-MSM: News Archives November 25, 30, 2004. <sep><sep> It is a political reality that will make us pay a high price as long as the working class becomes aware, such as, and immediately dissolves the class society - because everyone will work with everyone? <sep><sep> The same goes for the SC and HSC Exam Fees. <sep><sep> To ensure a good translation of each textbook, we propose that the Minister of Education organize a major "national translation competition in Creole and Bhojpuri". <sep><sep> And they never write about all the expulsions, demolitions of Palestinian homes that have been happening in the last 10 months of 2010. <sep><sep> This makes the workers believe that they are talking in their interest (when they talk about the high price of electricity). <sep><sep> Then, when the ILO is organizing something for Africa, then ILO invites Ashok Subron to come and help, not as NTUC, but as an ILO resource person. <sep><sep> laborer Bala Subborayan, the Dawoojee family and Ittoo, professor Martine Desmarais, lawyer Jean Claude Bibi. <sep><sep> So the plan that the government has for the CNT, includes a reduction in workforce and a privatization process. <sep><sep> In fact, it is a crisis that LALIT has been analyzing for 3-4 years now. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There has been a Tripartite negotiation, which does not fall under the old system, nor the new system. <sep><sep> An economy based on agricultural development and modernization together with an agro-industrial sector that relies on the knowledge that people already have and that promotes progress as a support. <sep><sep> With the disappearing quota, how will the Mauritian textile industry maintain its employment levels? <sep><sep> How to avoid provoking repression, as in 1999, where incidents occurred that shocked us. <sep><sep> In Grande Riviere, LALIT is launching our new website today. <sep><sep> Today there was also a team from Rabbis for Human Rights from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. <sep><sep> In our last Assembly on Sunday, we also observed many mistakes in the way the list of people who received compensation was prepared. <sep><sep> 12. This indicates the nature of this group when a Mauritian journalist, Nad Sivaramen, who obtained US nationality and works for the Pentagon (US Department of Defense) writes an article saying that it is a good group. <sep><sep> Today, we are pleased to publish the notes on which Lindsey Collen of LALIT made his speech on "What is political lalit when it is not electoral?" <sep><sep> In Port Louis District Number 1 and Curepipe Midlands, where there are 3 candidates, reasonable results were obtained. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The support they were receiving began to fade. <sep> In 1997, X.Duval was encouraging the government to privatize, stating "By privatizing, the State will send the right signal". <sep> Then the political scene shifts to whether the partial should be fast, or slow, before or after March. <sep> There is also a newspaper that focuses on foreign investment, has more access to the economy, and has a circulation of 5 million copies. <sep> Therefore, the trade union movement here is not just a national event, but is also affected by the global economic dynamics that were unfolding internationally. <sep> Those who sided with their rival because they knew they wouldn't get the job, started to get close to him. <sep> It's a fiction because the real law guarantees continuity and stability. <sep> Let's point out that it's not Ashok Subron who designed the Lalit website. <sep> He explained that the budget is being presented in a time where there is an upcoming general election, a situation, and in the context of a global economic crisis. <sep> (Just to clarify, when we use the term "historical", when we use my name to define this former bourgeois section, which we call "historical bourgeois", it has a different meaning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I need to have a clear idea of what my family thinks so that I can become what I want, a free person. <sep><sep> We need to stop this infiltration, and if possible, end this penetration. <sep><sep> Today in the Zini state, workers are not able to provide for themselves and their families. <sep><sep> If it wants to do this, it has to create a separate foundation. <sep><sep> However, he left us with a memory that will mark our association forever: He managed to participate together with us in our last work. <sep><sep> But he took Maiden's course! The resistance was recovering the movement, but the movement was stiff, and the recovery was precarious. <sep><sep> The worker we call "manuel" also used his head. <sep><sep> This program came out in English version before the election. <sep><sep> They were just trying to become popular by any means. <sep><sep> But when Paloma parted ways with another season [of a TV show], she suspected that the TV cook was trying to keep his new job given to him by Diego with a glance, but when he decided to go back to where he was without TV. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people have lost their jobs, there are fewer people with money left to buy products. <sep><sep> In the Seminar at the beginning of the year, when my colleague Rada presented a paper analyzing the nature of media, we realized the importance of developing our own means of communication, independent of mainstream media through our website and our Revi. <sep><sep> GMOs are organisms that have been modified genetically to give them other properties. <sep><sep> Despite this, we have managed to make this point clear especially in the last part of the campaign. <sep><sep> What have I done with my life? Farouk is not gone! Tell my mother not to cry, tell my father not to be upset. <sep><sep> For it to function properly, it must be reigned solely by a non-profit, non-religious, non-political association. <sep><sep> When progress puts on a mask of rags, development in hell deepens; when success in a nuclear weapon race and victory blesses our miseries; when power in the hands of the military increases <sep><sep> Based on indicators in the meeting on Saturday 1 November, 2007 <sep><sep> This lack of clarity clearly represents an abusive use of this resource, making its use for a good cause more difficult in the future. <sep><sep> It is important to know how this law regulates working conditions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I met Um R that I had met before. <sep><sep> The opposition MMM-MSM-PMSD is already exposing its bankrupt political: MSM came out very weakened after the general election results, despite having more members of parliament than MMM. <sep><sep> (However, when he goes on a conquest in France, it is not easy for him, because the different literacy levels make it difficult for him in a foreign language!) <sep><sep> This has triggered a new showdown on this size. <sep><sep> A support that he does through criticism especially towards Ashok Jugnauth. <sep><sep> And if the comrades were there on 1 Ziyet, comrade Lindsey put a paper on the class bench, we understood what "class bench" is. <sep><sep> Maurel (who is not in the established bourgeoisie, but who is protected by the Government, especially MSM) to start an ethanol production process, has been blocked since establishment. <sep><sep> When soldiers found Mohammed, they handcuffed him and put a band on his eyes and put him in a jeep. <sep><sep> And there were almost a dozen national forums on different topics: should water privatization rights be given, should food sovereignty be ensured, can health care be provided by the private sector, can a sovereign country allow a military base, can the bank be liberal, should marriage between same-sex individuals be allowed, should women have reproductive rights, should rights be sold for mineral extraction from land where peasants live. <sep><sep> In 1978, there was a manifestation in Solitary Pond, then there was a big strike Ut 79, all movements were about to stop abruptly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He seems to convey his message in a very subtle manner. <sep><sep> On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Independence of the country, LPT has organized a reunion of 40 extraordinary poets. <sep><sep> After the report of friends Yannick and Kisna, there was a session of questions, answers and very lively debates on the embargo against Kiba, on how the movements of Chavez are facing difficulties with the rural bourgeoisie (Latifundi), on the agricultural policies in Kiba and their strategies for food security, on the personality cult of Chavez, on the opposition to the dictatorship in Kiba and how many officials of the State and corrupt officials are active in this opposition. <sep><sep> Leveche has let us know that there are certain common points between what they say and what the two points are, and former Minister Obeegadoo confirmed over the phone that he sees no problem with these two points. <sep><sep> It is very sad how many times we have been colonized to hear a prospective prime minister using Creole language in public meetings, in public gatherings. <sep><sep> and when Berenger goes as far as menacing Commonwealth so that Great Britain is forced to recognize jurisdiction, what does Blair do? <sep><sep> When we were distributing the same leaflet at the University of Mauritius, the police arrested 2 of our members. <sep><sep> To review the actions of last week and the tasks for this week. <sep><sep> And from today, when Wilbert takes the floor, behind that screen, there will be a new technological innovation. <sep><sep> Because a banking system like this, not only is it politically dangerous, morally corrupt, it is also extremely difficult to implement technically. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Both faxes, one addressed to Lindsey and one to the Family Commission of LALIT, are very sexist and violent. <sep>When Lalit wrote to the Red Cross about the issue of prisoners on Diego Garcia, they responded to Lalit to express their concerns. <sep>We also have a real nightmare where people with money can "buy" fake identity cards for their opponents. <sep>They are asking for a relocation plan if the government ever needs that land or to regularize their situation. <sep>The report states that the work of the Ministry of Lar and Culture relies on a definition of culture that favors "traditional ethno-religious culture" rather than promoting the modern culture that people are producing in Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Agalega. <sep>Regarding the third case, it is noted that TUTF's financial agreement is on a "federation" level (not at the level of a union or confederation), and it is this federation that qualifies for financial gain. <sep>In addition, the Government has started to guarantee (to a certain percentage) for Labank, to allow Labank to provide loans for university students and Small and Medium Enterprises. <sep>To maintain control, the team of the local authority will need to make a great effort. <sep>We have to evaluate informal democracy and formal democracy on the work site. <sep>The LPT dictionary is a prototype, and its web assembly is also a prototype. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the tenth grade, we made progress in harvesting, we did not find any harm or pests. <sep><sep> We, in Lalit, our concern and anger are to find the Earth covered with concrete and tar, where factory could put Cybersite and its electronic connections and satellites anywhere on the pink earth. <sep><sep> This year, on May 1st, it is entering a somewhat special period. <sep><sep> For this reason, we present this book. <sep><sep> Each of us will take 20-30 Revu in the sac, and distribute it everywhere. <sep><sep> When one sees people manifesting, dressed in the humble clothes of New York, saying "Occupy Wall Street", they first recognize that it is financial capital that has brought us where we are today. <sep><sep> Some ecologists say that we use "fossil fuels" rather than nuclear energy because of the dangers associated with nuclear energy. <sep><sep> Up in the sky, a thunderous sound invited people to return home and showed them to stop smiling in black. <sep><sep> In construction, there are companies like Bhunjun which was once a small construction firm and has become a major construction firm because it has contracts with the government. <sep><sep> According to the law, the police do not have the right to arrest or detain people without a passport and ID. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As we have found in the colonial system, the system of slavery, imperialist camps, resource piracy in Asia, Africa, Latin America. <sep> <sep> The Commission has members who are professors, who are in the PTA, who are in the preschool sector, who are in the LPT. <sep> <sep> The arrest of Antoine Chetty and Vinay Deelchand has exposed a true mafia within the heart of the land, and organized "counter" actions to kill and harm people. <sep> <sep> These documents demonstrate how the PTr, IFB, CAM, PMSD have been complicit in the British and American plot to dismantle the Chagos and establish a military base on Diego. <sep> <sep> If the Government proposes constitutional amendments in this sense, the Opposition will vote in favor, no doubt. <sep> <sep> In our Strategy Conference, Alain has said, it is for us to reflect on the concept of Mauritianism and Nationalism, their implications for the strategy we adopt. <sep> <sep> I own a woman whose husband has abandoned her with her two children and has gone to live with a younger and fairer woman. <sep> <sep> They all want to gain control over this part of the Indian Ocean. <sep> <sep> Establishments are entering into Joint Ventures with capital from South Africa and Kenya for these projects. <sep> <sep> Then, when these 2 bills come before Parliament, the situation will worsen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>  A funny question for a person who is not in the MMM party and who just said that he received a free ticket to the Presidency from Navin Ramgoolam, and he refused solely because of contractual language! <sep><sep>  All members who sit in Parliament, whether in government, in opposition or even as speaker contribute 4% of their monthly salary to the government's fund. <sep><sep> -Specifically based on party programs, based on a commitment to socialism, it can recruit people into the party. <sep><sep> He raised the question: "Why should we import tofu in a container, or a vacuum-packed when it is possible to produce it here?" In conclusion, M. Monty said: <sep><sep> For example, the tendency for the PT-PMSD government to move towards a form of repression against the press, against unions, against all opposition, supposedly to watch them and hold them accountable. <sep><sep> For example, there are several workshops led by representatives of anti-war and anti-military organizations from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, England, Germany, South Korea, and Palestine. <sep><sep> Because we have fought them at the level of ideas, analysis, and for the same reason why we still exist today. <sep><sep> We have seen how the Labour Party has resumed the development of State capitalism under new conditions and through new means since 2005. <sep><sep> However, during the 6-7 years, we have this confusion, meaning a semblance of the "best loser" system will disappear if we have one evening, meaning if it is not mandatory to bring your community on a Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> It also depends on how many people are present and the reason why they are there. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After 44 years of independence, there are still remnants of colonialism in the electoral system, communal classification, centralized power in the executive branch, and the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Do they have the right to put dirty water in front of my door? <sep><sep> Where South Africa's Apartheid had a nuclear arsenal. <sep><sep> 1984 - After the 1983 elections, there was a fleet where there were individuals who did not agree with the MMM "young" LDK - as they thought it was - because he was already a candidate in 1983. <sep><sep> What economic policies does this Government have? And these parties in power, what do they say their economic policies are: They defend a capitalist economic policy. <sep><sep> So, we are heading towards a more serious crisis today. <sep><sep> And they said we need to ensure education, health, pensions, and minimum legal working conditions (Labour Law) so that workers have enough to prevent constant rebellion, strikes, layoffs, job cuts. <sep><sep> They excel when there are problems one after another. <sep><sep> Furthermore, there are still 5 members of LALIT Alain Ah-Vee, Lindsey Collen, Rada Kisnasamy, Kisna Kistnasamy, Rajni Lallah who have been on radio programs or in newspapers of all kinds over time: <sep><sep> We believe that MSPA is even trying to dissolve itself now, as it has come to represent a company that no longer has the same economic interest. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, these two slogans represent the gradual punishment in the MMM strategy, which was introduced in 1981. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen, for Lalit, has also exposed how in documents like her page 9-10 Gokhool puts the spotlight on parents and teachers of the effect that language problems have on children. <sep><sep> In exams, he planted rice plants from various countries with considerable success - even if he only did it for the gentlemen who run the establishments where the meals are served. <sep><sep> The government is becoming increasingly repressive, attacking our rights and restricting our freedoms. <sep><sep> We say that individual rights should become real rights, not a long bureaucratic process. <sep><sep> I am telling stories to give an idea of ​​very different, very strange forms, class struggle, for us all to understand the concept. <sep><sep> Lalit was so focused on that theme that we even published a book on DIEGO GARCIA, a bestseller. <sep><sep> But also it should be noted that it has not developed particularly in one way. <sep><sep> The Supreme Court cannot classify people, it has said. <sep><sep> In ICT, a large ship has docked, the first companies in cyberspace. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he goes overseas to a country where he can exploit workers more, which forces working class to work for two or three jobs just to survive. <sep><sep> If there is a Prime Minister or First Deputy Prime Minister who wants to represent the interests of the private sector, he must stop pretending that he represents any constituency and infiltrate the Mauritius Employers' Federation. <sep><sep> These strict decentralization measures can integrate other cooperative developments in agriculture, such as among the younger generation, small-scale farmers. <sep><sep> The petty bourgeoisie is rising, and following behind is a leader, a kind of "justice", like Hitler and Mussolini, who start behaving like "Raddhoa" types. <sep><sep> The price of land is not only about buying and working on it. <sep><sep> The objective situation presents an extraordinary opportunity for LALIT, so we need to develop our means to seize this chance. <sep><sep> Quickly, a worker joins us at the lottery to show our united front, where past injustices happened. <sep><sep> * The state has a chance of things that happen "outside" of society, which is a chance at "independence" from all forces in society; <sep><sep> Ensure the right of return for Chagossians (and full reparations for the damages they have suffered). <sep><sep> He believes he can escape sanctions through his actions, even if they are narrow. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT, we believe that it is not just a local crisis concerning Zone Ero, but an international crisis that transcends European borders. <sep> However, there are ideologies like the American ideology, the great American revolution, that anyone can become Goldman Sachs, that any idiot can become President - yes, look at George Bush - that's an ideology. <sep> We have had a series of 3-4 meetings, political program sessions. <sep> Not so much scandal in the light, yesterday there was a book like this, as Berenger does like an example "Medpoint, Rose-Belle, STC, etc", but also the Medpoint issue has provoked a major political sanction on national level. <sep> How to create a repressive legal arsenal against violent men, to the point of even proposing to prosecute when a woman does not agree to file a complaint because she has no way to pay for a lawyer. <sep> 1) LALIT was born in a historic wave, and this makes a big difference. <sep> And since there is private radio, we have found an expansion of existing press leaks in the field of audio-visual, and a tendency to trivialize elections: the last partial elections. <sep> a worker employed by the establishment, Michael Wing Tim, an employee of the Municipality, 2 widow ladies, Veronique Topize and Bindoo Ramlogun. <sep> Sometimes it is associated with cyclical blindness, a pro- blindness from afar. <sep> Today all research has shown that statistically speaking, children can learn another language well, the more they learn their own mother tongue at an early age. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Paul Berenger recently criticized the repression of the police against workers who have lost everything: their jobs, a portion of their salary, and their dignity. <sep><sep> It's extremely troubling when we consider that the earthquake and devastating tsunami in Japan two weeks ago triggered a tsunami in the Guam region. <sep><sep> The future of the Security Industry and the Free Zone seems grim: by the mile of the beach is being eroded by VRS, and by the mile workers are losing their livelihoods as one after another Textile factories are closing. <sep><sep> Therefore, this implies that we might witness a shift between neo-liberal hegemony and an upturn. <sep><sep> Filtering through private companies to maintain jobs and sustain the demand in Mauritius' economy. <sep><sep> Indeed, it is rather an economic policy that we've been expecting since the PMSD, to a considerable extent, has approved of Singapore ever since the era of Lee Kwan Yu, as Prime Minister. <sep><sep> If we had the means, we would have certainly pursued reclaim actions, and should we have been successful in this, much of what ensued later would have been prevented. <sep><sep> Reality does not only exist in American films. <sep><sep> The Lalit party notes that the PT-PMSD opposition has conspired with the government to pass this law. <sep><sep> After its initial failure, where all Governments in Africa have refused to construct military bases in their countries, and where it had only its bases in Diego Garcia and Djibouti. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> While bureaucracy syndicates have another interest, its own interest, its bureaucratic interest for it. <sep> <sep> In this seminar session, we shall collectively assess how political situations have evolved over the past year. <sep> <sep> This is particularly possible due to the seriousness of the current systemic crisis. <sep> <sep> Pushpa Lallah said he learned a lot from this case. <sep> <sep> Those other laws that preceded the law saying, according to the American Constitution, "All Men are equal", were not marked by "except the blacks". <sep> <sep> Before we consider where the working class is and where the subjective is, let's consider a cube in which these 2 terms "objective" and "subjective" are spoken in Marxist vocabulary. <sep> <sep> That night everyone ate a pear from which Princess Prathna with her own hand had taken a bite. <sep> <sep> While the working class took power, it was a bureaucracy that absorbed and kept power. <sep> <sep> But even the Constitution says there must be such percentages for a Forum, when you send it out for 2 weeks, seven times with only 27 people, surely you're going wrong. <sep> <sep> They persisted even after Ziz Balancy showed they were not alike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the forefront in the fight against salt plantation, the fight against IRA, the fight against the Public Order Act (POA). <sep><sep> Climate change is bringing catastrophic consequences on agriculture, where people may not have enough food. <sep><sep> In response to a question from the public, he explained how important it is to preserve the mother tongue for children under 6 years old to reap the benefits later on. <sep><sep> We have posed the question, "What is the government's policy in the interest of the ruling class, when we, the people, go to vote in elections?" <sep><sep> There is no existence where the establishment is licensed and wins contracts through corruption and inflation, eroding the land, increasing its value by 70 to 100 times, it must always remain fertile land. <sep><sep> Another movie made with the reels of documentaries that Errol Flynn recorded during the revolution. <sep><sep> Whether the working class leans towards "democratization by the-PT" or "Get off Les by the MSM" which is engulfed in the interest of a "mountain bourgeoisie rising against state power". <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the recent introduction of Creole and Bhojpuri languages in schools, as well as the legalization of employment under certain conditions, represent opportunities for work that LALIT and pros organizations have been advocating for the last 30 years. <sep><sep> This neo-liberal political imposition, this privatization threat, this austerity, is bringing a form of unification in the labor movement through the "All Workers’ Conference" initiative. <sep><sep> Just for the record, to give a brief list of speakers who participated. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the occasion of "World Literacy Day", on 8 September, the Labour Federation is formally calling for the introduction of Creole language as a medium of instruction in our education system. <sep><sep> We tend to forget that workers used to start very early in the morning. <sep><sep> So, it is hypocritical that MMM and MSM defend trade unionists. <sep><sep> Because it is certainly true that the crisis can provoke a challenge to the capitalist economic system, a challenge to the capitalist system itself. <sep><sep> When the MMM wants, they talk about everything on corruption. <sep><sep> It is Lalit and the housing movement, together with residents, who sit in front of bulldozers when the government demolishes houses like in Sapelon. <sep><sep> In LALIT, our opposition is to “communalism” and “nationalism”, and we prefer people to unite around a conscious and clear political program, which they develop, share and promote together. <sep><sep> In their resignation, they raised concerns about the divergence in trade union strategies. <sep><sep> Also, soak up the distress, by wasting time where a young person is thrown into the labor market, and not creating more jobs. <sep><sep> This is so that the Government can control the prices of services, and also respond to the population. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As usual, the argument for privatization is that the government does not have enough funds to finance infrastructure projects or public service delivery. <sep> <sep> Then, in a religious assembly, Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolman announced that there may be a possibility for the Government to reconsider the possibility of having a power generation station in Pointe aux Caves. <sep> <sep> Since extreme-right economists like Hayek and Friedman that Reagan and Thatcher implemented, private companies put aside British workers, close their British factories, do what they want, and this also aggravates cyclical crises. <sep> <sep> And I will tell real stories from the degrowth movement from '79 to explain the concrete form that these two forces took, when one got stuck in a deadly struggle against the other. <sep> <sep> To explain this point he gave two examples of how traditionally a woman changes her name to adopt her husband's name and residence where it is often the woman who goes to live in the family home. <sep> <sep> Cut a goal to use as a bowl then take a small piece of kari that you want. <sep> <sep>Lindsey Collen read the translation The paper boat in English and said that through his poem Alain Fanchon succeeded in taking a simple theme and creating a very profound poem, which is at the same time a children's poem. <sep> <sep> Other children in the village used to call it Tantinn Timi. <sep> <sep> When we take a position against the base, what we are doing is finding allies. <sep> <sep> When we go into mobilization against the strike, the other thing that needs to be done, we need to seek maximum support for this strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that moment, where their ears are slightly exposed at a low altitude, 4-5 guards had put parasols on their ears. <sep><sep> We were mentally prepared to face this. <sep><sep> This session that my friend Rajni and I [Rada Kistnasamy] are presenting is on non-electoral class

small boat, even, in the poem, it comes to be one. <sep><sep> Here is what I wanted to share with you today. <sep><sep> For a long time, anger and frustration were piling up on the hearts of disadvantaged people who suffer all kinds of colonization and immigration. <sep><sep> Its degree of organization where politics; its degree of power vis-à-vis the state/support from the state/a

they are not normal elections. <sep><sep> Presenting ourselves as a movement that goes house by house to educate people. <sep><sep> The government is investing heavily in the tertiary sector, particularly in the university level. <sep><sep> This is to expose the ways in which the Israeli military occupation violates international law and human rights in the Occupied Territories and Israel. At the same time, his aim is to get Israel to stop torturing Palestinian children in prison. <sep><sep> Then, just after the banana salad, Bizlall forms another collective and only semi-public union within the FP U: the "Collective of the Free Sectors". <sep><sep> up to its organized religion, up to employer institutions, as well as formal institutions in the State. <sep><sep> Whatever you call it, it is the working class that will create this unity. <sep><sep> You have used the term "finality", but i find it in contradiction with the dynamics that exist in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Due to the limit of damage, it appears that the village election is going ahead before the municipal election against the MMM-MSM Alliance. <sep><sep> The MSPA has become 5 estates and more than 18 plantations without a mill. <sep><sep> As a threat to democracy, Ram Seegobin said that if the government were to abolish village councils, district councils, Lalit would protest against the move. <sep><sep> Today in the Zini State, these "neo-con" companies that increasingly control the press don't even have one bid to provide accurate information, such as the BBC claiming. <sep><sep> Using these two concepts, their goal is to destroy class consciousness among workers. <sep><sep> When one gives their word as a member of a party, or as the party itself, one should keep it. <sep><sep> LALIT has learned that the branches have fixed two meetings on alternative economics (contact us for details), one on stock exchange and other financial capital expenses. <sep><sep> and measures to institute a suspension, arrest, and prosecution of guards, organization for staging of civil lawsuits, pressure to change institutions that are corrupt and masked state violence. <sep><sep> Workers are requesting a Rodriguan COLA to compensate for the additional needs of Rodrig. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, there has been repression against people in the press: there have been crackdowns on private radios, arrests, and threats. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At least Jamouna's daughter managed to reserve a seat for a man. <sep><sep> LALIT sent this article to Le Mauricien, but it has not been published. <sep><sep> But when he obtains power, he faces a problem. <sep><sep> Hotel bosses on the West Coast provided transport for people to attend the demonstration, we withdrew. <sep><sep> There is a transfusion in the new ministers; Jim Seetaram. <sep><sep> Neither does he hesitate to come give us lessons on the "U-Curve" especially the "V-Curve" as he did on the radio and television. <sep><sep> With MPL, a husband can "hurry" his wife just by saying a word three times it can "hurry" her. <sep><sep> Small business in the site work sector has a new phenomenon on several work sites, whether public or private: workers start posting articles on the work site, selling with colleagues. <sep><sep> As soon as this person gets this stick, they can sell it to a company that will start a hotel. <sep><sep> So all this reflection and research has led us to develop this class analysis that began to be published in LALIT DE KLAS Review in 1976. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, Minister Gokhool is starting to implement this weakness in the political strategy of Obeegadoo by imposing its A-PLIS system which is accentuating the competition at the CPE level by creating a quality college that is only for an elite and it is also continuing to ignore cognitive and psychological needs that affect individuals who do not learn in their mother tongue. <sep><sep> But, the protesters have found out, it is time to do something else, so we have been heard to say that we are dispersing. <sep><sep> As Balram already said, people 'if they had to cook themselves to find a foothold because they only imitated what their parents had done in front of them when they were children. <sep><sep> Morning daycare, evenings and school holidays are a community service for working parents. <sep><sep> That is for the authorities, for privatisation, to go to the private sector. <sep><sep> one that raises the question that the Islamic world did not go through the "enlightenment" era that the West went through; another one was an analysis of the upheavals in France regarding the “Contract de Première Embauche” (CPE). <sep><sep> But, one must not believe that the class struggle was only between labor and planter, because the planter has been waging his battle against others for a long time. <sep><sep> He only has to be ailing to live, to pay his rent, pay his CEB, because over there, he is spending his money. <sep><sep> In a packed hall, Ram Seegobin for Lalit and Rajah Ramdaursingh a DCDM accountant, presented 2 different points of view on the budget. <sep><sep> Another world is only possible when all these military bases are closed and foreign military bases are abolished and when there is a global demilitarisation and at the level of each country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After a radio program with a member of LALIT, Ram Seegobin was talking to Nita Deerpalsing, and said 'You're aware, the government will take money with compensation, will make workers redundant, give establishment for VRS'. <sep><sep> Those in the nationalist current are busy paving the way for socialism to emerge, they are already taking a step forward, such as the collaboration between the working class and the local bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> More than a hundred responses from peace organizations, families, environmentalists, academics, war veterans, students, artists, filmmakers, grassroots parties. <sep><sep> Sometimes Berenger talks about his "values" very vaguely, things that everyone agrees on. <sep><sep> A political party does not exist in a void, in a vacuum. <sep><sep> Many in our Depressed Conference are similarly shocked by criticism of the concept of 'Mauritianism'. <sep><sep> In parallel with this, they do not report on the activities we are undertaking. <sep><sep> There is no reason to stop anyone, you stop him, you beat him. <sep><sep> After that, there was a particularly interesting testimony from a craftsman from Savannah, named France Prosper, who was a member of the OAU but continued to protest after Rima sold on 15 August, and gave his reasoning. <sep><sep> When the Labour government was destroying homes on state lands, activists from LALIT and the housing movement responded together with residents, sitting in front of bulldozers to protest against the demolition of houses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are 2 ways in which they are trying to fool us. <sep><sep> It is in parallel with the liberalization of the WTO, meaning it seems to go against the country one-on-one. <sep><sep> LALIT staged a protest against the US warship USS McFaul in Port Louis harbor. <sep><sep> Lastly, after the licensing of the 2 MTC directors, we found out that Jack Bizlall made a terrible blunder. <sep><sep> The more capital concentration in the media, the more it becomes a tool to guard the insistent capitalist society. <sep><sep> But, there are a series of elements lying but desperate, putting pressure for prices to rise. <sep><sep> There has never been a candidate team that has laughed so much as this team of 5 women during an unforgettable campaign. <sep><sep> While the colonial State is using repression to weaken workers' class organizations, it has also encouraged the plantation associations that have found a political voice in the Advance Group. <sep><sep> They do not have a more equal society, a society that is more sympathetic to people. <sep><sep> Its population is suffering due to lack of food, medicine, supplies, construction materials, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have been conducting analyses for over a decade now, with the aim of protecting the Indian Ocean (to protect the industry and ensure the guaranteed prices that are essential, especially when they become illegal according to the WTO), with the country now entering a "systemic crisis." <sep><sep> It's not just speculators, but even icons of mafia, all kinds of fly-by-night investors who are coming to do what the English call a "quick buck." <sep><sep> Ultimately, the "Equity Fund" that the government set up to save textile companies has not had any success, and the major shareholders, especially those from Hong Kong, have disappeared. <sep><sep> We need to understand these different levels of consciousness. <sep><sep> Leaded by composers and pianists like Rajni Lallah. <sep><sep> The second element that brings out this first challenge is what the First World War in 1914-1918 canceled out all political activities. <sep><sep> It doesn't say that the plan is more favorable to the social class. <sep><sep> The actions and methods of the bourgeois parties The traditional bourgeois opposition parties "action" is more focused in Parliament, in Municipalities and District Councils. <sep><sep> The MSPA boss even suggests that the value of the industry is not exaggerated. <sep><sep> We were, in a way, in need of our political affiliation.

We have found the development of new imperialist and militarist interventionist faces, by Western capitalist countries. <sep><sep> What is important is that Lalit has created a new social and

majority's work, and which has a State to perpetuate its established system, we must organize politically. <sep><sep> Paul Bérenger is in an alliance with Ashok Jugnauth. <sep><sep> There is a directive that is 'permanent', a spokesperson in the media year after year, who goes into all negotiations with employers and government, who goes to the ILO and other international conferences. <sep><sep> He said - do we agree that the links with the US and UK, who support the State of Israel. <sep><sep> and the assurances they might lend money by estimating their value by including all these prices, they have failed and seriously threatened to fail. <sep><sep> LALIT supports the initiative of a police group to form a trade union. <sep><sep> It can no longer fight the historical bourgeoisie, so it is trying to develop sectors that are not under the control of the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> And even if we have not yet found clarity - between us - but we have clearly

and universal rights. <sep><sep> It is important that we follow what is happening in labor, especially in relation to the role of union bureaucrats who, as sheriffs, take their time in fighting to gain control over the sector. <sep><sep> This is a phenomenon that is quite new in the modern age. <sep><sep> There were people who were more qualified to make this innovation. <sep><sep> There are

land-owning individuals who had the right to vote. <sep><sep> Traditionally, the Plantation Workers Union (PWU), Artisan and General Workers Union (AGWU) within the Mauritius Labour Congress (MLC) played this role. <sep><sep> And every time Bérenger spoke, people started shouting "cousin, cousin" and made racist remarks about Bérenger, when in fact the MMM was implementing the program it had

including Diego = 84 First Past the Post, plus 20 Proportional, from a list of names of the Party - in a list determined by the party. <sep> <sep> When there is an unequal society like this, each individual or group of people, when they will understand why they are in difficulty, they have 2 ways to interpret their misery. <sep> <sep> But apart from this, we must realize that the problem of Chagos is not just a humanitarian problem. <sep> <sep> Since we formed as a party in 1982, there have been general elections in which we have put up candidates, and there have been general elections where we have not put up any candidates. <sep> <sep> Indeed, the MSM-MMM did not intend to postpone the elections for a year. <sep> <sep> They forgave the MMM-MSM for its persistent and absolute abuse

Nadja Rakowitz from Frankfurt has had a last visit of 15 days, we have had a second Marxist visitor to help us in our ongoing education. <sep> In conclusion, I would have been glad to explain to you briefly the new beginning that will unfold within the trade union movement. <sep> It also laments the fact that the lack of a space for literary criticism can grow, and that is why two people have been invited to criticize the novel for its launch. <sep> And those beneficiaries of cane fields, they support the St Felix artisans who are losing their jobs due to the Blueprint. <sep> Besides, L'Express talks about the general strike, the main headline being "The itch in the potatoes." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What we have been proposing for a long time, is the need for constructive internal movement of the trade union, whether in the public or private sector, to establish a program of demands that questions the logic of the capitalist system itself. <sep> <sep> In the security industry, as Nita Deerpalsing, etc. are leading a campaign against employers in the security industry on a communal basis, they are on the march with them. <sep> <sep> Even though in their political discourse, they say they are against communalism and against the Best Loser System. <sep> <sep> But tonight was not a mess they were looking for. <sep> <sep> To conclude, we would like to happily say that this program will be based on which we will be actively involved during the electoral campaign and also afterwards, in preparation for an extra-parliamentary opposition. <sep> <sep> Instead, the Labour Government and then MMM-MSM believe that it is better for everyone in the country, workers, artisans and smallholders, they see short-term benefits. <sep> <sep> What we have found, and what we have only partially discovered, is that we have received nearly a month, 6 weeks, of our computer levels, and some of them are computers from Lalit, which have files that have been destroyed piece by piece. <sep> <sep> In terms of public services, the Civil Service Federation is still fragmented. <sep> <sep> In terms of bilateral relations, we have developed interesting relations with Australia over the last 5-6 years. <sep> <sep> The education system has become so decrepit that languages that the majority of people speak, namely Creole and Bhojpuri, are considered as illegal languages. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Similar to the workers who brought the welfare state challenge and the "New Deal", some capitalist states have become slightly more privatized. <sep><sep> It will be a special campaign where different organizations will campaign for a 'Language Plan of Action' to implement the various tasks that different states have signed on mother tongues. <sep><sep> Dr. White concluded that there was police negligence. <sep><sep> He always felt very good when he was with Sami, even though he was legally married to another woman and had children with

the state and government took a commitment to provide alternative work to those who were licensed. <sep><sep> In the UK, there was a big protest, more bombs. <sep><sep> In other words, once again, the Ramgoolam regime is favoring the bourgeois state. <sep><sep> He was the first scientist where the Westerners found the world in a way a prelude (that is, as ecologists found it), and this vision

<sep><sep> As for the Palestinians, this year, we have witnessed many advances. <sep><sep> And in the history books, to prove their representation as a single class at the end of the spectrum, often they form alliances, the two parts representing the interests of two different sections of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> And all this is happening at a time when the Ramgoolam government is preparing for the 2013 Budget, at a time when the economic crisis in Europe is worsening, the UK is entering a recession, and even in Eastern countries such as China and India, there is an economic slowdown. <sep><sep> Between these two assemblies, there often used to be meetings with the OAU, so that we could discuss how the hunger issue is unfolding. <sep><sep> But, can there be equality when there are different social classes dominating or being dominated? <sep><sep> Apart from this economic problem, how do we feed the children? <sep><sep> The visit of the Prime Minister to Bihar recently was somewhat symbolic of his royal reign, as he looked at his ancestors' village. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A group called "civis romanus" was formed, Roman citizens, and all those who were not

the boss, and he is the one responsible for the economy. <sep><sep> In the context of conflict in the Middle East, the occupation of Iraq and the resistance movement developing there, the struggle to abolish all its military bases becomes crucial. <sep><sep> So it does a Re-Make with the MSM, then talks to Navin Ramgoolam, then Re-Remake, then re-Talk, and now, re-re-Remake. <sep><sep> So, that's how we see these two alliances. <sep><sep> This year, the European Court of Human Rights will hear a call that the Chagos Refugees Group has brought forth on the question of the right to return. <sep><sep> Some countries, as Ram pointed out, even in America, they have succeeded in finding places where they need to point the compass. <sep><sep> And why do we call it a "degreving movement," because it was a strike that started in its time, a degree of mobilization that existed, the strike was leading to strictures. <sep><sep> 3. "Wanted" leaders did not become participants in the "cover figure" until 2-3 days before the demonstration. <sep><sep> Minister Badry even went to Moscow, going to the Kremlin, because he was considered 'communist,' while at the same time Bolom Ramgoolam and Duval were running a hysterical campaign against MMM because it was 'communist'. <sep><sep> Even a Mauritius foundation is making everyone believe that "everyone has built their homes and walls" in places where the water needs to flow! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government needs to heavily invest in the development of the industrial sector in all our economic zones, including Diego Garcia, plus Baroswa, the fishing industry - and not just in this specific area known as the "sea food hub". <sep> <sep> Unlike the other regions, the Ministry of Labor did not perform as well; Minister Grangob-Bonnvenn became the flag bearer for the Ministry of Labor. <sep> <sep> When done properly, it is an extremely well-received allocation. <sep> <sep> There are several points that LALIT needs to address together. <sep> <sep> "Class politics, what does it want to tell us?” <sep> <sep> I would have been happy to return to this demand for the decriminalization of abortion and the way in which we have brought about mobilization around this demand that has allowed us to arrive at a situation where this bill for the legalization of abortion was voted. <sep> <sep> Everyday life for the Palestinian population means being undermined by Israeli arms, detention without trial, movement restrictions imposed by the Apartheid Wall. <sep> <sep> There needs to be a genuine creation of jobs, not just a focus on "micro-credit". <sep> <sep> But this marketing, it corrupts these political parties. <sep> <sep> In Cuba, they say, from the outside, the buildings may not look extraordinary, but on the inside, buildings are beautiful and lively. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The way Navin Ramgoolam acts, he is not only autocratic and dangerous, but he can also create frustration within the working class; some would have been happy to have a more important role. <sep><sep> - We are demanding good working conditions. <sep><sep> At the same time, we are the only political force that has taken up economic strategy issues based on the French Zone and tourism, two fragile sectors. <sep><sep> At the same time, the unemployment rate in general during the last 30 years, that is to say the level of wages and the quality of employment, also examined certain sectors in more detail. <sep><sep> There is a series of social crises, dramas, and crimes in the family, more tragic, more violent, and more sickly than the rest. <sep><sep> It’s like changing the final score of a football match after the match has ended by counting a goal for every 25% a team has had "ball possession". <sep><sep> During 2011, there was a new relationship between Navin Ramgoolam and "comrade Jacques" and also the Guimbeau clan in Lesid, who borrowed a lot of money to develop their distillery. <sep><sep> Genital mutilation, forced labor, different forms of harassment on a person's body, are also categorized as forms of participation in what is called sexual aggression. <sep><sep> So, to mobilize everyone successfully, to lead a campaign in a united way, is not easy. <sep><sep> So, the police had actually BANNED this series of slides projections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many members were arrested and placed in front of the court. <sep>
<sep> 3 Governments have organized plantation exchanges for their animals. <sep>
<sep> And only before that, in this context, 2 months ago, in Ut, a military regime made a single drastic cut to withdraw subsidies on the artificially increased carburant prices that had a significant impact on public transport. <sep>

<sep> After some weeks, MMM met with OMT-FNAS, OMT-FNAS withdrew its 30 candidates. <sep>
<sep> But when we look at the history of this machine, we find that its value is determined mainly beforehand by all the work done by workers alike. <sep>
<sep> What is the government proposing to eliminate this inequality? <sep>
<sep> So today, unfortunately from what I know, there are very well tightened ties in Mauritius, a political party dating back for a long time acting as a political party. <sep>
<sep> The first language people use is what they learn in school. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that tears are flowing every night and terrorizing the villagers in the last week of the month. <sep><sep> - we have bilateral links, meaning one-on-one connections with socialist parties in other countries. <sep><sep> On the phone, Dinesh told him that according to a convention that the country had been forced to sign, there was no right to give any subsidies. <sep><sep> without maintaining pressure on issues of sovereignty and decolonization, without denouncing this military base that all Chagossians suffer. <sep><sep> After 9/11, it was almost necessary to bomb the civilian population of Afghanistan and Iraq, but as the British Foreign Minister finally admitted. <sep><sep> We need to reprint free books to send, so that children can continue to learn. <sep><sep> For example, the American dollar (the currency) is a key player in the global financial system. <sep><sep> So, the situation, RIOT was providing assistance on the streets. <sep><sep> "the committee notes with concern the non-governmental information consistent..." on the issue of police violence. <sep><sep> 1982: here, our candidate is saying that voting for MMM-PSM is without illusion and on a list of 10 points in their program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have mentioned that to make the strike, you must make a secret ballot, meaning each worker must vote one by one. <sep><sep> It has popularized child health and distant child games. <sep><sep> Then with this money, the foundation was started. <sep><sep> In 1955 RM became the Mauritius Party with J. Koenig as president and Guy D'Arifat as secretary. <sep><sep> Well, that's example of a land where the beginning should have been. <sep><sep> But when it has been pressed like this, as if there was production in proportion, this "all correct" becomes a kind of treasure. <sep><sep> And bright colors, strong colors, all film songs, including, they too, in your memory. <sep><sep> Well, the first thing is that we don't need to make concessions on strategies, in political language. <sep><sep> 50,000 workers in the Sugar Industry sector have now become 5000 today. <sep><sep> In fact there is this collective force that is represented through unions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that they use their monopoly on information and space and time to suppress all ideas that challenge the infernal logic of the capitalist system. <sep><sep> His independence allowed him to have lunch with Sir Ralph and they often spend weekends together. <sep><sep> When they went to Timi, they went to a party where Balram was. <sep><sep> Last year we found out that IPCC (Inter-Governmental Panel on Climatic Change) - which has 5 Mauritians - and Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on ecology. <sep><sep> - Many institutional sessions that use Kreol language for its administration and/or its pedagogy: J.Harmon and G.Chung, P.Lallah. <sep><sep> If we take Lerope, for example, we find the various ways the state in France, Lalmayn and the European Bank have been protecting the bourgeoisie since the Eurozone crisis. <sep><sep> Central Onivo Committee, the 3 people who resigned were replaced by other members. <sep><sep> Ten LALIT activists were present for Mike Cole's intervention. <sep><sep> Along with the rupee depreciation, this led to an increase in the prices of all basic commodities. <sep><sep> It's getting more volatile, and it's people who are volatile, with the economic crisis already behind us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To combat corruption, to address the serious problem that is arising due to the AIDS disease. <sep><sep> We took the Medpoint example that Rajni mentioned, to analyze this case. <sep><sep> There are 80 participants from different parts of the world, such as the Mars Voyage, the Palestinian villages, and individuals coming from Israel in pairs, organizations in Israel like Rabbi's for Human Rights also attend the voyage. <sep><sep> This family has remained here for generations - a farm that grows vegetables and raises poultry. <sep><sep> And then, negotiators announce that there is an intervention by the Prime Minister which has increased by 20%, instead of 16%. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie's "Historical Bloc", which has been reigning for a long time, is developing cracks, and it will need to be reconstituted if it wants to maintain the capitalist system in power and profitable. <sep><sep> There is Plan A, B, C, D, and there are plans in which the government is not only seeking specially crafted solutions for the financial sector, which has been the favored sector until today by the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The political force that it is bringing is to survive when it entered the Labour sector from the MSM, and eventually it has entered and his brother benefited an 80-acre piece of land close to Bambous. <sep><sep> "The End of History" (The End of History, 1992), a book by a certain Francis Fukuyama. <sep><sep> Which other country has another 1950s that are still relevant until today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And then he said "Now listen to the purpose that you have broken and that you have kept with me to carry out my base". <sep><sep> He encouraged cooperative movements to finance plantation. <sep><sep> There is a theory that law comes from God. <sep><sep> This justification came out of colonial inequalities, where it protected historical bourgeoisie with all its arsenal of laws and practices. <sep><sep> We are now looking at how we can influence workers, organize workers in different economic sectors to bring their demands to the forefront, through the trade union. <sep><sep> And they have chosen a place where 78% of the time in the year, the wind will bring pollution on the sea, this is unacceptable. <sep><sep> It was an extraordinary evening where even the artists themselves found that this ambiance had no equal. <sep><sep> The government made a mistake amending the law to remove the "good conduct" eligibility for prisoners serving sentences for these crimes. <sep><sep> Because we must not make a mistake in saying that Mauritians are naive. <sep><sep> He gave an example of the Alain Tolbize union. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The police have opened a case against L. Collen and R. Seegobin following the campaign "Platform Pa Bush" launched in December 2002. <sep><sep> People of all ages, normally they build strong organizations so that democratically they have a service in the countryside, and so that they do not have to go borrow, or resort to borrowing, a "professional" enterprise that serves the people. <sep><sep> There, people need to organize themselves to stand up to them. <sep><sep> And this election has been a catalyst for a process of confronting the plunderers (oligarchs) and the local bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> In 1992 it was even justified by this line when the Lerop Ini creation where it was said how Mauritians would have access to European passports if Mauritius had a status a little like a French DOM-TOM. <sep><sep> The defeat of the MSM-MMM would have been even more massive if the PTr had not been so credible in opposition. <sep><sep> True to form, he sold this to someone else. <sep><sep> I advise my comrades to reread the Diskur Bidze Pravind Jugnauth when Berenger was Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Either the capitalist class will impose a solution of austerity based on shocks and devaluation, or they will impose it through repression by a coalition government. <sep><sep> Last year, there was a huge pre-electoral rally for the Prime Minister. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A systemic crisis, it differs from an ordinary crisis, as it threatens the continuation of society in its existing form: it can provoke a force. <sep> Norman Tanbanivoul for Sant Idriss Goomany, Father Phillipe Fanchette, Jayen Chellum for ACIM, also took the floor. <sep> Instead, Ashok Subron and members of the Lalit youth group are looking for a solution to these problems, they choose to launch an association that serves as a platform to denounce the technology used in websites. <sep> Here, PMSD and Xavier Duval attempt to form a new detailed bourgeoisie in this sector. <sep> This figure represents an increase of 25.3% in the number of people who normally speak Creole language at home in 2000. <sep> Lindsey Collen explained how in the year 2000 when Paul Berenger and Aneerood Jugnauth came to power, that is when the government proceeded to arrest Cehl Meeah and many people involved in hold-ups and burglaries were caught. <sep> In addition, he made a call on the radio, he said that Lalit has a place here, he called on Lalit activists to come together here. <sep> He also mentioned a "power-sharing" with a "communal connotation". <sep> The General Assembly will take place in September 2011. <sep> Central Command/Combined Joint Task Force for Horn of Africa. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We received 2 militants from the DSP Australia, we had 2 speakers on a particular topic (Mike Cole on Education from a Marxist perspective, and Nadia Rakovitz on Marxism from the Frankfurt School. <sep><sep> So, to return to what Comrade Anand said, what are the different social classes? <sep><sep> But in contrast, Marx said you can't say "Here live in nature", because in fact it's like saying "Nature lives in nature," because man forms part of nature itself. <sep><sep> There is a series of activities in Gaza that will culminate in a protest on December 31. <sep><sep> After each paper, there will naturally be plenty of time for discussions. <sep><sep> Under what conditions did the Government pass the ERiA bill before 2008, the trade union movement united in a common platform against the introduction of new pro-employer laws. <sep><sep> And this movement, which had a meeting in La Chaumiere, brought together all "Mauritians", and if so, logically, it gathered all employers as well. <sep><sep> The Government realized that its bias was in favor of employers, if the working conditions and pay in the employer's hands and unions, this will satisfy the employers. <sep><sep> A mess in general, but it is a reflection on the economic and political crisis situation. <sep><sep> Mr. Pakeeree and his children, they are also victims of patriarchy because they have lost everything they loved. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Until today in LALIT, we are still criticizing and challenging the nationalist policies in Mauritius, a policy that favors the employer over the workers. <sep><sep> This is why LALIT, along with the trade union movement, started opposing the privatization of Telecom under the Ramgoolam-Berenger-Jugnauth regime since 1992. <sep><sep> But the law says that if you find it normal for a government to take a loan for two years, well, when you are protesting with more than 11 people, it is also normal for me to catch you and put you in a case. <sep><sep> Now there is a new "cycle of hope" emerging after the victory in Seattle. The "cycle of globalization acceleration" imposed in Doha by the Bush Administration and certain "neo-liberal hawks" has died. <sep><sep> So the US State Department has reorganized the warlords who were completely discredited in the eyes of the Afghan people. <sep><sep> We have been committed for many years to bring about this mobilization. <sep><sep> In a broader perspective, there is a world of difference between the Workers' Party, which represents all kinds of interests as a party, and the "State". <sep><sep> Employers have come to terms with this until the unions finally agreed. <sep><sep> 2) What different types of crises exist in the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Both alliances have used comminution and casteist arguments in their campaigns and they both preserve a Best Loser system that encourages communal reflexes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not only that, Abu C. has come close to our house with his van. <sep><sep> The Lalit party along with the Mouvement Lakaz have been at the forefront of this struggle for the rights of all people. <sep><sep> even in Mauritius, there are strong arguments that have circulated in this ecological wave. <sep><sep> In the night of 29th October, the army has blocked the entrance of Jame. <sep><sep> Port Louis in 4-5 different schools, Curepipe L’Hotel de Ville, and in a series of villages: Surinam, Bambous, Rivyer Nwar, Pamplemousses, Mahebourg. <sep><sep> Peace was created by Henri and Marie France Favory. <sep><sep> They want to know, "Will Abe now, how will the Lalit movement proceed with its campaign?" <sep><sep> In the carriage, the plants were being roasted in the sun. <sep><sep> They began to kill their well-informed, well-fed mosquitoes (that we have not heard of so far). <sep><sep> They have already raised funds for MPA Chagos meetings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 1990, there were 115,000 Palestinian workers who had permits to work in Israel everyday. <sep><sep> Today, we will have Rajni Lallah and Joelle Hoseenee. <sep><sep> The United Nations Human Rights Committee has given them lavapers. <sep><sep> And it needs to find which class of worker, between classes, will have more opportunities to apply his program that will make everyone equal. <sep><sep> I come back to the point that comrade Rada made, he is not addressing the fact that most people Mauritius Rodrig can not, for example, stand as a candidate because of language barriers. <sep><sep> There, Japanese soldiers will receive them, with signs of heads that show respect. <sep><sep> Today, if the State of Israel continues to lean on the Miray on its path, it will take it right to go to university and come back. <sep><sep> In particular, we have cowled, and are cowling, for the importance of bringing light simultaneously to everyone: <sep><sep> When the government decided to start production in its army, consumers began to have hope. <sep><sep> There was also a plot against Paul Bérenger, who had killed through Bérenger, all, while he was the "leader", when he appointed a dozen new members to his Central Committee, and a half-dozen new members to his Political Bureau. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Which capital class should ally with other classes to ensure the continuation of its reign in such a crisis as what is coming? <sep><sep> What we have to do in this Conference is to understand the situation as it is today, especially to understand the difficulties, to understand the obstacles. <sep><sep> Emphasize courage, this concern brings more strength to us, which promotes the mother tongue in particular – not because of ideological reasons, but because it is better for everyone, especially for oppressed people, especially for all children. <sep><sep> On 6th November Rajni Lallah launched a new program in the LALIT series, namely Liberation Fam. <sep><sep> This text was written quite well in Marx's life, in 1848, and he wrote it in response to criticisms, which are incredibly relevant to us today, that he did not emphasize enough on the economy in his analyses on class society. <sep><sep> Then, a series of RIOT jibs arrived, the guards started descending into the jib, started looking for 'leaders', someone to "ring the bell", to trap the head in the jib. <sep><sep> He took a great risk because he could have ended up here. <sep><sep> The way he does this is partly through some anti-big-capitalist demagogy with a dose of racism, even if his current policy favors a capitalist class only under a large denominator. <sep><sep> LALIT has made many efforts to invite union movements: the trade union federations were invited to the Food Security Front and to the International Conference on the economic crisis. <sep><sep> We find it worrying and dangerous that confidential information such as health information may become accessible to other government institutions and may be used for other purposes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MMM is calling for 30 proportional deputies, then to create the Best Loser communal constituency. <sep><sep> and 4-5 teachers on the topic "Democracy in the workplace and worker's rights." <sep><sep> In Mauritius last Saturday, the 26th of January, I believe there was, not too sure, or rather, where they brought together trade unions, NGOs, some alternative political organizations. <sep><sep> They were looking for water sources early in the morning before sunrise. <sep><sep> For example, in the last village and municipal elections, they circulated notices in Creole. <sep><sep> When Mount delegate was talking, we know Mount delegate himself, and we know his name is Suresh Jahal, and we know he is a worker. <sep><sep> LALIT was against that strategy which is forming a New Historical Block. <sep><sep> What we understand in Mauritius is that communalism is an evil we should get rid of quickly as it's better without it. <sep><sep> When taking a show of hands vote, if you see your comrade voting, if you see a better union representative voting, then it is a collective vote. <sep><sep> Additionally, there is the fact that there is a new generation of workers who have not had the oppression of LALIT in the past. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Tuesday, the police were given an additional 23 hours to charge and arrest the secret. <sep><sep> meaning when he decided to leave his own political party, the MR, when he entered the PMSD, and when he found the MMM competing against him. <sep><sep> These demands that Lalit has brought forward, in the history of the workers' movement, call for transitional demands. <sep><sep> So will Navin Ramgoolam replace this strong leader? <sep><sep> to resist "adequate formality or appropriate informality" in our conversation. <sep><sep> However, Lalit is looking for strong employers to shoulder the crisis in its own system. <sep><sep> Minister of Labour Shakeel Mohammed presented amendments to ERiA and EReA in Parliament in December 2012 and 3 different union movements opposed these amendments separately. <sep><sep> On the other hand, there was a concern that employment would be the biggest challenge for the working class and the trade union movement in Mauritius. <sep><sep> They're calling for the system to be turned upside down, to reform it, according to many electoral needs, but it's all. <sep><sep> A good person, very favorable to strikes, but a union leader who is not in a strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He also explained how in the last election, the MMM focused on the case against DSK, a predator, who, through repeated denunciations, must suffer the consequences of his actions. <sep><sep> We are pleased to publish the speech of Radha Kistnasamy, a leader of LALIT, on the issue of "Energy", especially on conflicts between different bourgeois sections and the issue of energy. <sep><sep> But, Cader Sayed Hossen, has announced that he is going to file a case in favor of the Best Loser system in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> There have been heinous crimes in the family institution, and truly tragic events. <sep><sep> Because what we are not witnessing is the reign of capitalism, there is not enough democracy and freedom for us to control production/distribution/finance. <sep><sep> Last year, there were many problems with the sugar cane harvest. <sep><sep> In addition, it is a Resistance case that has been brought to ensure that communalism attacks are not included in the Constitution, but they have indeed clearly ensured that Best Loser will not be affected at all! <sep><sep> So, one after another, you get one girl after another. <sep><sep> When you look carefully, the minister is breaking the monopolistic hold of Mauritius Telecom so that other telecom companies can enter the sector to do business. <sep><sep> LALIT has formally demanded that the Mauritian government (in repeated form) introduce such legislation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain M. has presented a report on the branches of Rose Hill, Plaines, Stanley, Mountain Ory, and St. Pierre. <sep>
He condemns the illegal occupation of public beaches by dangerous fundamentalist forces. <sep>
Thus, children must go to school in the morning and do this; convince parents and children through recourse to big ideas like "progress," "development," "success," "social uplift," and even ideas like "freedom" and "equality." <sep>
- Pleasure for the members of the association promoting the Creole language: Pushpa Lallah (Playgroup & LPT), Lindsay Morvan (JUSTICE & MPRB). <sep>
Yesterday, in the conference chaired by LALIT Rada Kistnasamy, Lindsey Collen, explained how LALIT will organize for this Friday. <sep>
With the death of Liliane Simonet Tigresse yesterday [Sunday, December 10], at the age of 70 in ICU Hospital Jeetoo, Mauritius has lost a Mother Courage. <sep>
As a comrade just said, intellectual power oppresses him, kills him subtly in other compartments. <sep>
Here my dad started saying: 'We have a Seychellois family; Let's start Seychelles proceedings'. <sep>
We have obtained good support for tracking and distribution continues in other regions through branches and regional LALIT. <sep>
• For compensation for the suffering that all Chagosians have suffered and continue to suffer. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recently, a new phenomenon has emerged among the WANTED: 15,000 Youngsters who have come to Azir Moris, with Jameel Peerally. <sep><sep> With the dawn of decolonization, visits to the grievance have systematically increased, and efforts are being made to suppress the flames of the unrest. <sep><sep> Registration begins this Saturday and will last for a month. <sep><sep> Capitalism is intelligent, it adapts well, it knows how to deconstruct the struggle through promising offers, all of this. <sep><sep> Behind all this lies the shifting of the crisis burden onto the shoulders of poor people and workers. <sep><sep> We need to act consciously, in the face of oppression. <sep><sep> It shoots what will come after it puts the spotlight. <sep><sep> and contribute more to the development of LALIT programs, for everyone to become more active in political life, and make an individual contribution to make our program a movement. <sep><sep> There are some selfish interests of certain leaders who prioritize everything else. <sep><sep> It brings modernization, but not necessarily focusing on what is old. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, on the 10th of January, Ram Seegobin will be on Radio Plus at 4:30 in the Grand Journal. <sep><sep> Everyone thought Didier Robert would be there to meet Arvind Boolell, and they were expected to have a meeting with the Government and MSPA this week. <sep><sep> LINKS, Australia, 2006, an article on Alternative Economy, by Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> As everyone was expecting, DSD and his allies won the election with a comfortable majority, and Dinesh formed a government where women held many important positions. <sep><sep> After this, a new "turn" occurred where there was a formal meeting between Ramgoolam and Berenger. <sep><sep> This means women don't have any role except to follow "the leader". <sep><sep> Soon after, there was a regrouping of 20 colonies on the other side of the road. <sep><sep> But it wasn't just the women who were saying this. <sep><sep> When we talk about neo-liberalism, what it really wants to say is that in the past, a sufficient social democracy had developed before the development of an entire world nearly being overrun by the class struggle after the class division, even up to the collapse of the Fukuyama gate in the USA, where a new movement called "Occupy Wall Street" was triggered in 600 different cities. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He spoke at length about the great demand that the LPT is receiving from associations and even private companies for adult literacy programs for their members or employees. <sep><sep> LALIT is leading a campaign to develop a new stable sector that will create jobs on a large scale. <sep><sep> What's extraordinary when you reread these articles is how each article helps us understand the reality of today, even if the article was written in 29-30 AD. <sep><sep> Watch out for the risk to your career with improperly managed CID, when CID strikes. <sep><sep> According to the responses we receive from some surfers, it seems that they come specifically to check our analysis on the events shaping reality and the news section to keep it as up-to-date as possible. <sep><sep> Finally, Mr. Dookun set up a company called Blendax to produce toothpaste. <sep><sep> Then we had civil societies, we had a lot in the past, in the history of Mauritius, where there were organizations that brought in funds, for example for people's rights like voting rights for women. <sep><sep> The government is making political efforts to allow the private sector to make IRS, meaning selling land to billionaires abroad, creating huge estates. <sep><sep> This is the government policy nowadays, something that employers have been looking for for a long time. <sep><sep> In the book of Esther, there is a character named Jacob, an important figure in Judeo-Christian relations (I believe). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One day a council governmental group came with an motion blame against the question of Madam Lemer. <sep><sep> Too many small businesses bankrupt, 80% after 3 years of existence. <sep><sep> I don't wanna find a pretext where the earth's surface is an inch away. <sep><sep> And he puts that 2nd term in the context of this celebration of Independence Day where all nationalists are celebrating Saint Mars and the Government has invited French parasite in parade. <sep><sep> You will also find some dynamics that can exist. <sep><sep> Union leaders in civil and para-state services don't seem interested at all with other major threats posed to workers. <sep><sep> Women and their plastic bags and a plastic bag are walking to go to their village and pick fruit from the other side. <sep><sep> Comrade Ram: There are two points worth mentioning. <sep><sep> They continued to bite the ground (with all sorts of new exceptions to tax). <sep><sep> He defends the interests of the working class in the short term, but especially in the long term. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the various rare occasions where this has been possible, what the parents have done is just annoying, they have entered the school to protest. <sep><sep> In his account, he stood together with the oppressed people, with the working class. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, BIOT also contained a few islands that were illegally occupied from Seychelles, but later Seychelles reclaimed and regained them. <sep><sep> His father had to deal with 24 establishments. <sep><sep> There was something that went like this "An orphaned people without a country". <sep><sep> Because of this, everywhere in the darkness of Bomatom, there were groups against the dominant power, but they weren't too efficient because their strength dwindled. <sep><sep> Apart from the economic crisis that could be serious enough to precipitate the devaluation of the rupee and dramatic increases in the cost of basic needs, there are social crisis threats when the pressures exceed tolerable limits. <sep><sep> But if that 19% is applied to all public transport companies. <sep><sep> Bagatelle Dam also experienced a significant delay, and now with the water shortage, we are paying the price for that delay. <sep><sep> MMM had an anti-criminal strategy, based on "Mauritianism" since the 70s. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes, his imagination and speculation are more important than his own reality. <sep> <sep> Do not take 7-8 steps, sit at a table, make a decision, create a unity like this. <sep> <sep> - Then there was the pretext of "combating terrorism" - Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan invaded under this pretext. <sep> <sep> If global warming intensifies and depreciation increases (25% in 2 years), it is a true crisis. <sep> <sep> What has happened on sugar cane and textiles is Europe, when 15 member countries have become 25, it has included many new agricultural products. <sep> <sep> In another sense, the film has come a long way from where "The Naked Civil Servant" left him, and later, in particular, in normalizing the way society looks at people who live as transvestites, or in English, "transvestites". <sep> <sep> Today, when Herman Assy reports it (with a special background), he talks about something like "After RA, who presented his proposition last week, LALIT has taken a stance." <sep> <sep> In the days to come, GWF will be contacting other trade unions for the development of a common action plan on this issue. <sep> <sep> As we find today with its VOH, FCM. <sep><sep> That is what any Minister of Commerce (like Cuttaree) can do to place his own chair on issues like CAN, COMMITTEE, WHICH SECTION IN A SERVICE, which he is "offering" to "multinationals". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before 1980-81, the MMM, it must be said, had an anti-imperialist discourse, where it criticized the illegal occupation of Diego and Tromlin, as well as the militarization of the Indian Ocean. <sep> <sep> However, the right to strike is often interpreted in different ways. <sep> <sep> Here a boss made photocopies of LALIT tracts, while our 2 members were waiting. <sep> <sep> The Data Protection Act specifically allows sending private data of anyone with secrets of the country overseas. <sep> <sep> National systemic crisis is within a crisis that is international systemic and they are linked, but they are not the same thing. <sep> <sep> For more than 6 years, in LALIT we have been predicting that without real economic diversification, Mauritius will continue to suffer from the systemic crisis that threatens the standard of living and quality of life of workers. <sep> <sep> Despite the fact that there was inside it, the life that should have been treated like in many cases, it was actually found to be more a Radhoa case, as NHRC full-on launched during Radhoa times. <sep> <sep> If you are interested, send us an email at lalitmail@intnet.mu to apply. <sep> <sep> Finally, in 1982, all the members of LALIT who were in the MMM resigned and formed the LALIT party. <sep> <sep> You will not be able to get more than where Mr. gets his dividend, his profit, starts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The accused was arrested by the police "ris" Roland Fozoo and Devianand Narrain from his home, and they were taken to the police station. <sep><sep> MMM had a very basic and simple analysis, but it was truly the first-class analysis. <sep><sep> In one of his big rallies he said "that many creoles have succeeded". <sep><sep> Because of this, it is impossible to eradicate poverty in the capitalist system, but they don't say it's impossible Justically, they say "minimum wage" or they say "a bus driver must get a minimum wage by Remuneration Order" and this is supposed to represent a fair wage. <sep><sep> There are two types of crises: a production crisis, on one hand, and a balance of payments crisis (in the US, for example) where the balance of payments goes into the red. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah spoke about a mobilization campaign for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> Ready on April 18th, which provides a list of archived documents. <sep><sep> And they are reducing the population to a nation of "house slaves" who will cook for the gentlemen, clean their clothes and hotels, look after their children. <sep><sep> This means we resist this general atomization. <sep><sep> There are military forces shifting rather toward the East, like in Australia, Thailand, the Philippines, to be able to supervise China. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he came out first in the fourth examination, his father wanted him to continue until the sixth because that would give him a chance to work in the government as a monitor or nurse later. <sep><sep> True love cannot exist when social inequalities are still ingrained in our existence. <sep><sep> In the Sugar Industry, even though it's called the Cane Industry, profits have decreased by more than 50%, and many planters are stopping cultivation of their land. <sep><sep> comrade Ram Seegobin participated in a 12th program broadcast on radio on the political crisis. <sep><sep> People, by the thousands, continue to protest against the arrests, detentions, kidnappings, torture and assassinations of opposition to the military regime. <sep><sep> Everyone was participating at all levels in discussions to change the Constitution itself, so that we can emerge from this series of institutional crises. <sep><sep> Some sectors have developed well, especially in the PL region where there are 2 sectors, one leisure, one industrial, and others have remained stable: B.Bassin, Richelieu, Rose-Belle. <sep><sep> The press, and radio have taken a hit, but it's difficult to have a strict debate in the context of this type of daily program. <sep><sep> For 7 years, we have had a program for agriculture, using land to produce food, developing agro-industry and fisheries, and developing renewable energy. <sep><sep> Let's look at these different parties one by one: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not only did Ramba start talking to Ramou, but he also began developing an affection for Aisha Bibi. <sep><sep> And now the Government no longer has the same central role as before. <sep><sep> They call it "marketing." And in economics, you cover all aspects of society. <sep><sep> With the work that has been carried out in the Morisyan Creole Academy, along with the support of organizations and individuals who promote the mother tongue, there is a need for necessary tools for the mother tongue to be the language of children in the Republic of Mauritius today. <sep><sep> We had set a meeting place in the small garden behind the Garden Company because there were too many police officers in front of the Garden Company. <sep><sep> But at the same time, his gaze showed a firmness and intensity that made many people feel uncomfortable when he looked at them. <sep><sep> There were members present of the Chagos Refugee Group, representatives of Amnesty Mauritius, and several artists. <sep><sep> Each sector of work has its own award, and the award helps determine the minimum. <sep><sep> His business-mindedness told him that if he knew how to draw, new developments, new situations, or new events could fill his position. <sep><sep> Soon after, an armed colonel arrived along with a radio phone call. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These estates are no longer considered legitimate or legal. <sep><sep> Except for one person who supported MMM-MSM, and Ram who endorsed it, all other members predicted a 40-20 loss in favor of the Social Alliance. <sep><sep> When you examine it closely, it doesn't seem fair to Lend. Lend is an old society, it's moving along, being ruled, and being attacked by British colonization in its borders. <sep><sep> According to them, the system is just fine. And politics, according to them, doesn't match with the economy. <sep><sep> It even includes measures that reinforce historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> However, at the same time, we are also finding some enlightened positions taken in the press that could bring some progress for the Creole language - which has been there since Gilbert Ahnee, J. Claude de LEstrac, Mrs. <sep><sep> While Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared that negotiations between the two communities should establish two separate states as the only viable solution. <sep><sep> Once they even published a poem by Aziz, 'We are all Creole,' which clearly shows that the divisions that are troubling Jericho hide a much more positive reality. <sep><sep> Throughout its 50 years of existence, there have been 5 times when PMSD has joined forces in a coalition with PT. <sep><sep> People are busy with some plantations, taking care of animals, engaging in small businesses, and working in civil service spaces of the Palestinian Authority (hospital, school, administration). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Meanwhile, we must condemn those who are contributing to the alimentation of this war zone, that is, the illegal occupation of Palestine and the complicit role of the Zionist state in supplying arms to Israel.<sep>
<sep>And we know that this crisis will last for several years.<sep>
<sep>Prior to this war, most recent wars, they were known as “pre-war -war”.<sep>
<sep>A large part of the underprivileged section who they call "underprivileged" - in Mauritius and partly in the world - do not manage to survive this long "downturn" in which we have found ourselves.<sep>
<sep>This has led to relations between trade unions and political parties in certain countries such as England, where the trade union movement launched the Labor Party.<sep>
<sep>All this is happening at a time when there is a very serious economic situation.<sep>
<sep>At the same time, the police are vigorously enforcing "Rogue and Vagabond" laws against them.<sep>
<sep>‘Morisyanism’ abstracts the class society and aims to disarm the working class in the struggle between classes, it obscures concepts such as the class struggle.<sep>
<sep>They cannot predict what will happen after this.<sep>
<sep>The Mauritian government must immediately initiate proceedings for an Advisory Opinion at the United Nations General Assembly to bring a case for an "Advisory Opinion".<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, in all ways, today is not like before. <sep><sep> They have come up with different plans, with the same objective, which is to survive in this crisis. <sep><sep> Another way to conduct is to develop and revitalize our Program. <sep><sep> It is a strong leadership, and not easy for either the employer or the repressive State to reach it. <sep><sep> So we have transport to only go to the village center. <sep><sep> I told them how among the reasons there is a decrease in the production of perishable products, an increase in the consumption of imported food in China, and the use of clay to plant corn to produce ethanol. <sep><sep> We can create a front, a class that we regroup against City Power, with goals different from the bourgeoisie, but make our voices heard. <sep><sep> These two classes, objectively (that is to say to count or not), have conflicting interests. <sep><sep> - Freedom to move (3rd time instead of .5 hour) making it impossible to leave the house to go to the university every day. <sep><sep> The representative of Kolez Form VI stated that it is difficult to return to the Sixth Form College. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And at that time, despite the fact that the Lalit de Klas group was a very united group, a very militant group, a very active group, but the political direction that eventually had to separate it, was the MMM party. <sep><sep> Those who believe that, likewise, this so-called princess, must ascend the throne, with the necessary skills. <sep><sep> Families who want to progress towards equality and freedom in society must hesitate to enter as a boss in this kind of patriarchal organization that hinders the freedom of expression of the workers' organization. <sep><sep> Minister Xavier Duval has launched the YEP program (Youth Employment Program) to absorb some unemployment. <sep><sep> It is rather an economic crisis triggered by the takeover of financial capitalist power which has displaced the capitalist in production, especially in sugar, textiles, in a former colony's economy like Mauritius. <sep><sep> But sometimes we use materials with a somewhat negative cultural dimension. <sep><sep> Lalit and the Refugee Group Chagos went to Mumbai in a delegation in January, 2004, and put Diego Garcia as an item on the NO U.S agenda. <sep><sep> What we have managed to do makes it a good second day. <sep><sep> So the sabotage of the Zone of Peace process corresponds to the economic, political and military interests of the USA. <sep><sep> The answer must be that we should not confine ourselves to these restrictive frames, these linear frames. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen spoke at a conference against Lager in Johannesburg, organized by the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and the Anti-War Movement in South Africa. <sep><sep> The occupying army interrogates them without the presence of their parents or a lawyer. <sep><sep> There are citizens who are already 25 years old and have NEVER voted in regional elections. <sep><sep> It is a time when there is a lot of talk about national unity, national pride, all communities must march hand in hand. <sep><sep> This leader depends on his private army, his private network that will bring him to power. <sep><sep> Whether you vote by candidate number or by symbol. <sep><sep> Then we share this deeper appreciation together. <sep><sep> So, there should be pressure on Opposition sections to get into Government. <sep><sep> He has represented, in history, the interests of the secure bourgeoisie and the reactionary petit-bourgeois living, especially in Beau-Bassin-Rose Hill. <sep><sep> like CIEL and Rogers, who themselves master the art of waiting for us, waiting for us to work tirelessly 8 to 10 hours a day, can they even improve their profits? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This situation, it seems, could be of interest to my family, and my friends in the Liberation Family Movement. <sep><sep> Otherwise, we will go on the same trajectory as the MMM, if we ever seek to unify ourselves with the Quran which includes the bourgeois elite. <sep><sep> In April, Ashok Subron announced that he is withdrawing as a member of the Central Committee of Lalit within its branches. <sep><sep> This organization which Marx, Engels and other revolutionaries founded in 1864 when in Europe there were big meetings called Universal Expo which allowed workers from all over to come together in one city. <sep><sep> In Yemen, the same situation, when Saleh is weak, now, in El "Nou", the Islamist Quran is gaining strength, even the pro-Al-Qaida Quran. <sep><sep> His work is a right and in a job our rights must be respected as individuals. <sep><sep> Tim Kan John, a banana plantation worker, is quite satisfied with his harvest where he is harvesting 50,000 bananas per year on a plot of land. <sep><sep> Despite his populist form and the fact that his buttocks and abdomen are quite noticeable, he is getting quite a bit of popular support for his stance because there is a lot of frustration among the masses about how the buttocks operate. <sep><sep> Currently, he is located in a place called "The House" and he is providing comfort to confront the Israeli settlers. <sep><sep> There is a debate about whether the workers of St Felix will receive their Blueprint, and he has promised that all artisans will receive their Blueprint. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Currently, the Trade Union Trust Fund is financing the union. <sep> There is no longer any perspective and only those who have money or whose parents are abroad can go out to find a more lucrative job (Brain Drain). <sep> Meanwhile, on the political front, there has been significant development this year with the appointment of Paul Berenger for health issues. <sep> But we know that what has been further exploited is the fisherman in this region who work in the "so-called" BIOT that we do not recognize. <sep> And this analysis, we are popularizing it through a reunion campaign, poster, leaflets, DVD movie sessions, and this campaign, for sure, is deepening our analysis. <sep> And this year the theater piece, TRAS, for re-editing, and we hope to present it on stage, it will be another homage to a great literature. <sep> They are not just putting their advertisements in the spaces where they place their advertisements (advertisements which, incidentally, are also a form of bourgeois deviance in the same). <sep> Let's remember that the only excuse for giving the boss public money is to prevent layoffs. <sep> In the budget, Pravind Jugnauth has confessed that they will only deliver ... 2,500. <sep> This violence is occurring in a context where we are experiencing an economic crisis which is responsible for worsening in the social situation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - Ram Seegobin was invited to the Asia Pacific International Solidarity Conference, 2005 where, among other topics, he spoke about the military base in Diego Garcia. <sep> Then, when we went to meet with the unions, what they were transporting, what they were wearing, it was important to note the reality their sector was facing. <sep> In the midst of general confusion, we didn't even realize there were arrests being made. <sep> Without all this reflective work, strategic development and action, perhaps our two mother languages would forever be more marginalized. <sep> He has been in power for a long time, since Independence, if you look closely: from 1969-82, 83-91, 2005-2012. <sep> On Tuesday, all the candidates were supposed to sign a letter to say they didn't want to participate in the communal best loser exercise, and if the Electoral Commission never appointed them as a communal best loser, they're already saying they refuse that best loser position. <sep> And he went even further, he said why workers aren't developing an "Independent working class foreign policy." <sep> To begin with, it was a pre-electoral period where no dice were being offered. <sep> Regarding Diego Garcia, LALIT agreed on the date for the BIG CONFERENCE FOR THE ABOLITION OF FOREIGN MILITARY BASES, meaning 7-10 March, 2007 in Ecuador. <sep> At the same time, big US multinationals like Chevron, Haliburton, Unocal and French multinationals like Total Oil must stop holding dictatorial powers; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is hope for an alternative, I find that people are gradually adopting the capitalist system. <sep><sep> This reflects an unpredictable crisis: Sithanen vs Bheenick, Ramgoolam's nominee. <sep><sep> We walk from The House to reach the villages. <sep><sep> This is how we envision women's liberation within the LALIT Party. <sep><sep> Sometimes walking together with the working class, sometimes truly taking the form of a working class. <sep><sep> Yesterday, multinational corporations like ExxonMobil, that have a big interest in the exploitation of oil resources, have massively financed the Republican Party and President Bush. <sep><sep> And without even being colonized by Great Britain when they return. <sep><sep> Even a sector like the French zone, which is difficult, when there is a bit of union experience, strike experience. <sep><sep> Such as in the police (many officers and special police officers are mentioned as PMSD  <sep><sep> Its debt (sovereign debt) has exceeded 99% of its GDP, this is almost the level of Greece. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, the situation in Mauritius is taking a worrying turn with crises arising in the textile and tourism sectors. <sep><sep> Some people say that the mother tongue is not yet being adequately taught in schools. <sep><sep> Having competent doctors means having people who have not reached a dead end. <sep><sep> However, if efforts can be made to broaden workers' councils, this could lead to the development of "dug power" and a move towards workers taking control, a true open democracy. <sep><sep> Secondly, there will be a need to re-evaluate the levels of TU school and TU colleges. <sep><sep> It would have to start the university program again, just to keep abreast of the latest developments. <sep><sep> No, because they know that if they say this, they may experience a backlash when the problem is revealed, and they may say "Let's train our population in information technology!" before the issue escalates. <sep><sep> As the Municipal Council is now, councilors quickly become bureaucrats who are only concerned with selling permits and organizing auctions, negotiating contracts; when they are not fighting to become the leader. <sep><sep> Especially since there is no policy to make the Mauritian economy less dependent on exports and imports. <sep><sep> If a multinational company suddenly takes control of water, raises prices, starts rationing water, and the Government says, "Sorry, I had to change my mind." <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This global movement to take a step back has revealed that, from the outset, as Marx was saying, there is an international plan. <sep><sep> Today, the PT in its governmental program and in its discourse from the throne, is describing it as representing the bourgeoisie of the state in a clearer way than ever before. <sep><sep> What we will do in the 2nd session that is supposed to begin in an hour, we will concentrate a little more, even though we have already said a lot on the issue of "nationalism". <sep><sep> Now the entire trade union movement has broken into pieces in front of the Ramgoolam government: instead of demanding the revocation of ERiA and EReA. <sep><sep> Apart from STAAF, there are 4 other projects that ACALAN has completed: Translation Program, Terminology Program (in which Rada Kistnasamy was present in a seminar in Pretoria recently), Master's and Doctoral conversion program. <sep><sep> When you arrive in Tel Aviv, as soon as you enter into Palestine, every second in a minute you realize that you are in a country under occupation. <sep><sep> Present in Berlin for this intellectual work was a 50-year-old academic and activist, who had already done economic studies. <sep><sep> So Lalit de Klas did a lot of work to strengthen the Sugar Industry Labourers' Union (SILU) and the Union of Artisans of the Sugar Industry (UASI), before these 2 unions went on strike. <sep><sep> 4 x 20 constituencies, plus 3 more seats, it makes 84 seats. <sep><sep> There was a debate on the need to develop a regional strategy and organize a regional strategy in the face of the blackmail that imperialist countries are imposing through their "Economic Partnership Agreement" with regional blocs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The first thing we propose is for the government to stop its stupid policies where it is trying to make everyone in Mauritius become servants for foreign rice. <sep><sep> In May 2001, Lalit wrote to the Minister of Health to accuse him of serious negligence. <sep><sep> For the first time in Mauritius' history, voters will have to vote for a replacement for a Member of Parliament whose seat was vacated by the Court due to electoral fraud. <sep><sep> When it becomes illegal to use slaves' memories, then it is the employers who were compensated by the British colonial government and the Mauritius Commercial Bank that benefitted. <sep><sep> We all know that the recession is beginning to bite in America, and the influence of global capitalism. <sep><sep> But that power comes from the uprising of an Establishment that has an interest in IPP and other related interests, which includes the MMM and those close to it. <sep><sep> The Trade Union movement organized many demonstrations against the measures in Business and Employment Park in 2006, on the issue of redeployment of 200 DWC staff, on subsidies on fuel and examination fees. <sep><sep> The last point was to announce their new case of "Crime Against Humanity" which they will bring to court. <sep><sep> L'Express represented the interests of an urban bourgeoisie, it also had a strong communal-based approach, in this case, Creole. <sep><sep> So is it worthwhile for us to delve into questions that concern a union and its importance? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Has the decision to publish school books in Creole and Bhojpuri been finalized? <sep> 
<sep> But, that means when we talk about the clash in class, it is something quite ordinary, it happens every day. <sep> 
<sep> These two things can be seen as a balance, when one goes up, the other goes down. <sep> 
<sep> Yes, especially those who have to pay a fine of Rs20,000 to close their case. <sep> 
<sep> Xavier Duval, through the organization of the Creole Festival, a celebration that focuses more on promoting the identity of a community, is taking on the role of a comminal leader that his father used to represent. <sep> 
<sep> It wouldn't be surprising if in a year, the MMM and the Labour Party announce that they will face the crisis, as “true patriots”, they are forming a national unity government. <sep> 
<sep> By definition itself, he is helping with what was already responsible for the economic crisis. <sep> 
<sep> Under the condition that historical bourgeoisie doesn't get tainted when “other families” come into the big bourgeoisie. <sep> 
<sep> Yesterday, the MMM-MSM Alliance and the Labour Party systematically opposed the government of England and America. <sep> 
<sep> And Berenger has already announced (before Chady's resignation) that he wants to hold general elections "beyond 2005". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If he doesn't do that, he will have to pay the worker 120 days of salary and 6 times the severance allowance. <sep><sep> The only way I can become what I need to be is to guess. <sep><sep> But today, thanks to the political policies of Government after Government, how do parents do casual work, seasonal work, contract work, whether they are in small sectors like domestic workers, truck drivers, construction workers where there is no payslip, or they are self-employed in the informal sector of the market, fishermen, farmers, small-scale planters, small entrepreneurs, who also have no payslip? <sep><sep> According to the Labour Act, an employer can dismiss an employee without paying severance allowance only if the worker has committed misconduct. <sep><sep> What LALIT is saying seems more true, more fiery than what MPM or Subron are saying, then that link is important. <sep><sep> Yesterday in Cuba and Venezuela they did that. <sep><sep> Many people often say "claims and demands are the same thing". <sep><sep> It is a "working arrangement" in the sense that the trade union movement it represents is the only well-developed organization in the working class in Mauritius today. <sep><sep> He has made an Order in Council that the Labour Authority will do that. <sep><sep> This was an example of bankruptcy of the Social Democratic parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is the TCSB that decides whether the reduction in income is justified or not. <sep><sep> At the same time, workers in Mauritius who are going abroad on contracts, in Canada, Ireland, Qatar, Workers are becoming mobile. <sep><sep> In the Free Zone of France, for example CIEL has a license in Madagascar, in Bangladesh, it has a license in Las Palmas. <sep><sep> Difficult for the STC to face the increase in rice and petrol prices at the same time. <sep><sep> On the African continent, the process of decolonization has taken different forms. <sep><sep> Some sectors have been well developed, especially in the PL region where there are 2 sectors, one leisure, one hospitality, and the others have remained stable: Bois Cheri, Rivière des Anguilles, Bamboo, Black River, Mount Ory, Moka, St Pierre, RH-BB, Plaisance, Cpe - Rose-Belle. <sep><sep> When God brought up the debate about agricultural diversification on the main roads they say that they need to diversify so that there is self-sufficiency for Mauritius and Rodrigues depends only on their tables. <sep><sep> Like with a physical, the Government aims to grant pensions to the elderly. <sep><sep> but litigation becomes a movement that has the political capacity to bring that transformation of natural power that we are aiming for. <sep><sep> So Minister and Department for direct recruitment. Opportunity is sure to be taken." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This explanation is necessary so that it is not an arbitrary decision when rejecting their candidacy. <sep><sep> During this labor strike, there were large mobilizations, large demonstrations in the Garden. <sep><sep> The ruling class, which we commonly refer to as the "bourgeoisie," is facing a major difficulty. <sep><sep> This is my "hunch", when children use it among themselves, they appropriate it because the situation is informal. <sep><sep> which provinces' children still show through the English medium from the first days of school." <sep><sep> The construction sector is a sector where work is well organized, very professional. <sep><sep> Two days later, early in the morning, Princess Prathna, accompanied by Yosi, left her bed in the forest to go and look for the Lalang Soumra Bandouk in her house. <sep><sep> Language issues like "subject" at the school level in LPT, we always say that we are not against children learning as many languages as possible. <sep><sep> Our philosophy is that: the 1972 census divided the population into 4 categories, and when we look within these 4 categories, we find Mauritian citizens so we have our place anywhere in it, so we are free to decide. <sep><sep> It is not only the sugar industry and textiles that have been affected by WTO regulations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This ultimately helped the bourgeoisie to control the private sector and MMM became less pro-worker. <sep><sep> The University of Mauritius is launching the second Stand-Alone Module on Creole Languages for the year 2008-2009. <sep><sep> There are 885 million people who do not have access to potable water. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is a great strength in our program when we develop an in-depth understanding of the political work we are doing. <sep><sep> The "First past the Post" system of philosophy has two aspects. <sep><sep> There are supposed to be certain beneficial forces that operate in its favor, or the feminine is supposed to be fragile and in need of protection from men, or remotely, Europe is supposed to be the health of the world, or there is supposed to be a single "nation" or a single "element". <sep><sep> Today, we are also presenting an interactive film called Program for an Alternative Economy which already sets the scene for the kind of program necessary for agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> A strong breeze was blowing and the clouds were covering the sky. <sep><sep> The State of China held prisoners illegally in their military bases, especially in the Guantanamo base in Cuba, which the State of China illegally occupies, and also, closer to us, on Diego Garcia, a territory of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Readers of the LALIT website may be interested in an interview that LALIT member Lindsey Collen did for a newspaper, but which has not been published, as far as we know. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Are we facing a crisis that we ourselves have created? <sep><sep> He will present a paper on socialism, with special reference to South Africa. <sep><sep> With MAAS returning to the scene, with Navin Ramgoolam saying that money from Europe can be used to restructure the economy, here, we find that LALIT was saying something absolutely ordinary. <sep><sep> Everyone is walking, returning home in a row. <sep><sep> In Glasgow in Lekos there was a demonstration on Saturday 13 November organized by the Scottish Coalition for Justice. <sep><sep> Those present pledged to assist in a campaign to attract people to a program for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> When we look at our history, we find that for us, a program, a manifesto, demands and demands, it is a very important step for people to know what we are looking for. <sep><sep> Henri Marimootoo, Weekend journalist, began publishing a series of articles from declassified British documents. <sep><sep> But at the same time, Bérenger used a mysterious remark and calculation to appoint 3 judges of the Intermediate Court. <sep><sep> Big sectors, not just the security industry, but also sugar, transport, are laying off workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And also in Mauritius there are progressive movements (Lalit among them) that have protested against these kinds of laws in various governments. <sep> <sep> But sometimes, the MMM keeps only 6, losing 6. <sep> <sep> On Friday, the 25th of June, Ledikasyon Pu Travayer organized the launch of Lindsey Collen's latest novel "Orl Mama Bul Later" in GRNW. <sep> <sep> It is because Lerop usually represents a large part of the walk for justice, textiles, fish products, and tourism. <sep> <sep> So the question arises whether the MSM-MMM will come together, and who will be on that list? <sep> <sep> And the organization negotiates with employers in their name. <sep> <sep> This work leaves the field of social work to become pre-political work only when it is conscious, only when it mobilizes oppressed people, and only when it is done publicly, clearly and openly. <sep> <sep> The political force of our action means that they must adapt to a new reality where popular support for our program and actions is necessary, so they review and slightly distort it to change the appearance of a program. <sep> <sep> They were blowing up fireworks for a girl's wedding, and the girl is a chief collaborator in the village. <sep> <sep> From that moment on, there was respect and sharing between them and Timi. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So if it was possible to advise different social classes, to bring about permanent harmony between different social classes, then the state would not exist. <sep><sep> Lalit is launching a campaign for reflection and debate on the creation of a flat income through the development of food production on a large scale. What Lalit is proposing is reasonable. <sep><sep> Carol Benson says she realizes that it is difficult for people to imagine how Creole language can be useful when it has not been used yet. <sep><sep> We, the people of Mauritius in general, need to unite our forces, along with the Chagossians' voices, to stand against the base that caused the suffering of the Chagossians and the destabilization of our country. <sep><sep> Their policies favor establishment, large traders and industrialists, bank owners and hotel owners. <sep><sep> The images that the media shows is a platform that brings together in the same reality both the poor and the rich. <sep><sep> All our public meetings during the campaign were successful, with a balance between assistance and content. <sep><sep> It could not allow the heroic peasant history behind the iron curtain of modernity, development, and dignity. <sep><sep> Europe has started to gear up, and Europe and Japan have begun to challenge its supremacy. <sep><sep> and this through more use and explaining theory and practice in detail in the content of its musical style when it plays its instrument. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Jean-Claude from Caprinin once told them about a time when one day in the festival of fendane at the hotel, when they asked him for good health. <sep><sep> We make it through contrasts in the way others use the expression "an economy in crisis" to explain the way we find "an economy in crisis". <sep><sep> They have to do this to prevent the death in their own country. <sep><sep> We are a part that has a role to guide us from where we are in reality today, to that day which we can imagine. <sep><sep> There have been 2-3 occasions when a member of one party has asked another member to explain and justify the political significance of their vote in the Parliament Member on 4 Ziyet. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we find a classic text for analyzing the finance of the media, "Advertising: The Magic System," by Raymond Williams. <sep><sep> Lizinn is closing, many workers in institutions received VRS and early retirement. <sep><sep> In fact, Sahit Deir Balut is a great producer of fresh vegetables. <sep><sep> It started in the country of Lerop, and it blossomed. <sep><sep> The establishment must diversify its plantations, and its mills: starting to plant all kinds of vegetables and fruits, and develop a transformation industry for many of them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The third type of challenge and maybe the most important challenge, is the challenge of the working class against capitalism. <sep><sep> As we know, to respond to Yves, the financial capital section, among capitalists, who wield their power more in attracting cash in transactions, not in production. <sep><sep> There is the file LALIT, Fam, Ut 79, Language, Security Industry, a 30-year-old file that three work tasks have been completed (Only the keywords are missing.). <sep><sep> However, in Lapes, the basis and sovereignty of these proposals have not yet been made public. <sep><sep> And it has become more complicated with the results of the general election on 4 July. <sep><sep> a small group of people from the Adventist Church and 12 animators from National Women's Council have actively participated in the course and have shown great interest in learning. <sep><sep> (1) A large concession on taxes (reductions and abolitions of certain types of taxes, the absence of a true tax on capital, very low corporate tax, the absence of customs duty for certain areas, etc.) organized by political parties. <sep><sep> Spoiling and children looking for attention, spoiled children wake up with their limited knowledge. <sep><sep> This political-financial scandal has exposed the cruel economic liberal system that is speculating on essential sectors such as energy and making people poor and the working class carrying the burden of bad governance. <sep><sep> F.M. remembers from the Biddya meeting, she is a 46-year-old woman, divorced and has 5 children to take care of. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT also denounces the abuses of M.Assirvaden, chairman of CEB, who promotes government propaganda when he announced and justified this increase. <sep> <sep> Then the unions often criticize them, criticize the victims. <sep> <sep> The number of parents and children who are stressed when they know about exams, when they know that they have to get into a system where there are particular lessons, it's frightening. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, they are not taking comfort in it. <sep> <sep> It does not motivate its forces to fight for simple palliative measures. <sep> <sep> They each bend their knees, take small steps, and hesitate. <sep> <sep> This 1% (up to 10%) that gives them power also does not make them "responsible" because the system they control only has one goal: increase profits. <sep> <sep> I will tell a story from when I was in England in 1971. <sep> <sep> Then he found out that the questions they asked were not good. <sep> <sep> Similar to the houses in Mauritius that are still being arranged, are aimed to be landed to a neighboring plot. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In conclusion, the Labour Party and its allies do not have a balance sheet: they have allowed one crisis after another, as if learning no lessons. <sep> Omar chose to enter into business with his father Aisha Bibi. <sep> And today he is even more, we can say, in ICU. <sep> The economy of Mauritius, although it had adapted to global capitalism since its inception during colonization, has resisted quite well against the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. <sep> This type of development benefits more plantation and establishment owners with lots of land, in these regions. <sep> As Neeta Deerpalsing said about what Bahadoor said, for example. <sep> Even now, we are finding a White Paper on electoral reform that Ramgoolam announced is coming at any moment. <sep> When he takes political power through elections, the PTr inherits this colonial state, its laws, its administration and all aspects that make up the state. <sep> *We are bringing amendment to improve the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), especially to guarantee the right to strike and trade union freedom; while the Government is proposing a different approach. <sep> Also, it was said that the Faugoo Report will not be made public. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Those who have entered have also been stabbed. <sep><sep>He must do it before people start suffering from food shortage. <sep><sep>Those who had parabolic antennas were looking for news from neighboring countries or international stations. <sep><sep>We need to read what they had to say, we understand how they, in their time, understood how to build a political movement that questions the entire system. <sep><sep>So, when the revolutionary ideologues asked the kind of performance someone thought they had given their own rights, there is a reason. <sep><sep>This is why I was saying it was only independently that, apart from the content of the six books in the series being launched today, the Playgroup initiative was extremely praiseworthy and memorable in terms of cultural planning, because it not only fills a void. <sep><sep>He realized it very well and this, I must say, allowed him to accept his fate without resentment. <sep><sep>There is a need for a response from all classes oppressed by this system. <sep><sep>We are living in a time where capitalism - a system that has reached its most advanced stage - is dominant. <sep><sep>Also, we were a team of 6 to collect everything today so that they could resume work and children could return to school and university. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He entered the police sector (security guard, there is a party today). <sep> <sep> For lots of people in the world up to today, the most important law they face is this "sublime law": you will pay! you are going to pay on earth; you will realize! Don't go wrong. <sep> <sep> Its challenge is not the fact that the capitalist system turns all workers into merchants. <sep> <sep> Sithanen made the same serious mistake when he started a plan to provide "transitional" support to the private sector (Mechanism for transitional support to the private sector). <sep> <sep> First, he says there is a "campaign" being launched on Measuring Accompaniment and European Union money, where there are problems between the Government and the EU. <sep> <sep> Today is the time for it to make its strategy public! <sep> <sep> And these officials, especially when they get organized support like Raddhoa, they know. <sep> <sep> In 1994, Lalit launched a major campaign through a local and international petition. The petition was addressed to the President of the Republic of Mauritius and a copy to the governments of Hollande, France, and the UK: the colonial powers of Mauritius all the way, so it was directly involved in the atrocities that slavery causes. <sep> <sep> Geological Survey published on its website on Tuesday, March 29, 2011, at 4:58 p.m. <sep> <sep> Before the 2005 elections, all the leaders were clear that MMM and MSM did succeed in collaborating until the end of the elections, and so it would be a "2 to 1", MMM-MSM would necessarily report the victory against Labour. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Migrant workers were exploited but at the same time had to prepare for a new life cycle.<sep><sep>Ashok Subron, before taking the vote, announced that he would abstain, but also assured that he would respect the majority decision and participate in the work that the commission will carry out on the reorganization of work concerning youth.<sep><sep>- Tendency towards "Economic Democratization" (which aims to widen the bourgeoisie of the state and which conflicts with the historical bourgeoisie).<sep><sep>This is not the first time that this campaign has been brought into history.<sep><sep>But how can they guarantee that they will get Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)? So, there are people who are in need of social assistance.<sep><sep>He tried to create misunderstandings where he said if Meeah asked to meet him, then he would receive him, if he receives Meeah, and announces that he will be "pleasantly surprised".<sep><sep>In 2000, no one could have said "spoiled vote", nor a "spoiled sympathy vote".<sep><sep>Members of Lalit, Ram Seegobin, will appear in the District Court of Port Louis, Wednesday 13 January, to settle a case based on a charge that the police have brought against him as he has "disturbed" the police.<sep><sep>Launched by Dis-Moi, it seems clear why.<sep><sep>If we sum up our analysis of that era, as I said before, we had a colonial political regime, and before that, decisions went until the end of the 19th century. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These are actions that galvanize support across party lines in politics to which we are entitled. <sep><sep> So, it is not entirely clear what the Tian Li process will entail. <sep><sep> Immediately, the government has started saying that bus fares need to be increased. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie reveals itself evidently since a very small and average bourgeoisie means that family already owns means of production and will use state power to consolidate their economic base, enlarge their economic base, so that they themselves become bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The printing sector was where class consciousness was somewhat more pronounced, standing beside the proletarians. <sep><sep> Politicians were trying to gain sympathy for their life story overshadowed by lies and suffering. <sep><sep> Other parties do not have much electoral weight, but elections are often held on a tightrope, and as they are electoral parties, they come together for greater electoral and seating power either in Government or in Opposition. <sep><sep> This Creole communalism (in its current incarnation) is inherently unstable because it can be "climbed". <sep><sep> He works until he is 100 years old without ever stopping buying or using these products. <sep><sep> At the start after the speech by Ram Seegobin, we went back to this idea of starting a union. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As always, a music session would strengthen your friendship with music harmony. <sep><sep> We make a call to all citizens to take a stand against all forms of division and communal drift. We make a call to all workers and non-communal organizations to avoid falling into communal traps and refusing to go with the flow in communal and sector meetings. <sep><sep> We have successfully executed all that we collectively planned in the Action Plan presented at the LALIT Seminar on Planning in November 2004. <sep><sep> Every contribution to this struggle will be recorded in the history of humanity and in the history of our country. <sep><sep> And when there were bombings in Gaza, LALIT organized a vigil with Saint Idriss Goomany. <sep><sep> Yes, do not hesitate, come join us in the course "Understanding the world to change the world" organized by Brans Lalit (Plaisance-R.Hill) every Sunday, 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, at New Eton School, Rose-Hill. <sep><sep> he was known for his sharp wit, shooting with words, not guns; <sep><sep> It was not the first time a Lalit militant had a police case. <sep><sep> After a 4-day race that targeted modern educational models, especially literacy techniques well known like My Generator; Think, Tell, Write, and Read; <sep><sep> He also went to Cairo for action to break the blockade in Gaza, Gaza Freedom March, and even if they did not manage to break the blockade, they made a series of quite direct protests in Cairo. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are organizing a meeting and debate on the food security issue, especially in the context of the forces that are driving globalization. <sep><sep> 3. In many countries, there are police unions, and they help reduce issues for police officers. <sep><sep> And for the first time in history, we are accusing the Government of something much more serious: genocidal language. <sep><sep> We will be integrating our campaign into our University Student Union this year. <sep><sep> After dinner, Aziz went to assist at Kamomi's place, giving him a copy of his new poem. <sep><sep> However, with no program, it is difficult to choose which parts to use to create a cohesive whole, but they are not working together. <sep><sep> For more details on the World Social Forum and International Youth Camp, visit the website www.wsfindia.org. <sep><sep> An association is acting in a way to promote a new level of understanding. <sep><sep> e.g. Youth can't realize this, but the Labor Award long ago specified how a Tableman must pay his workers during harvest time, giving a specific amount per ton of cane and varying if it's flat terrain or hilly. <sep><sep> They are not even a guard to watch over the workers. There have been demonstrations, threats of strikes, all kinds of mobilizations, why? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Also, check the food, fry it, toss it, put it in, ready to put in plastic if you need to eat quickly. <sep><sep> One morning after a sleepless night, he went to see an old acquaintance in the village of Hamlet to tell him to find a good girl for him because he was happy to get married. <sep><sep> The concept of "Zwif People have no country" assumes the second definition of a country. <sep><sep> - Putting an end to the metabolic crisis, as Marx described it, which divides agricultural resources through the urban-rural divide, leading to the weakening of the soil in the countryside and problems of sewage and salt in urban areas. <sep><sep> In general, when you find a group, or even a movement, you know who is in leadership, and you know that these people are assuming responsibility for the majority. <sep><sep> He had a majority in Parliament and finally managed to pass the law. <sep><sep> Then on May 9, 2003, the Ministry of Economic Development, Financial Services and Corporate Affairs, brought it to the Ministers' Council for adoption. <sep><sep> And if you find it in writing, you hear it in all meetings, in the 1970s, you can say up to the year 1979-1980. <sep><sep> Geneva Convention article 76 clearly states “Occupying powers have no right to deport or transfer detainees from the territory under its occupation to the occupying country”, that is, in this case, Israel. <sep><sep> The first wave of workers from other countries emerged from the Philippines to come and work as household employees. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this sector represents a fragmented workforce. <sep><sep> He uses this type of slogan, the boss, this type of ideology to exacerbate the crisis from his side and to transfer it heavily to the workers. <sep><sep> But, it must be remembered that in the revolutionary period, the working class was a minority in Mauritius (peasantry was the majority and it could not rule a democratic state), and it was desimitated by the Lager. <sep><sep> In order to be able to build a large, large base on Diego Garcia, a base that is largely responsible for the soil, lagoon and sea around Diego. <sep><sep> Especially since a while ago, he was having trouble with Kamla. <sep><sep> The land issue, like in Mauritius today, is a critical issue in Palestine. <sep><sep> The consequences are clear: more poverty, unemployment, rising prices, insecurity in the countryside, land disputes, permanent language shift in life, social and cultural life are deteriorating. <sep><sep> It is on the same scale as the example of Ram, when he explains the collapse of the MMM strategy based on "Mauritianism" by dividing its content into class struggle. <sep><sep> Its cane has ended up breaking in the SUDS sector, which has since gained more importance. <sep><sep> Berenger could, for example, say that he noticed that Father Gregoire did not provoke any confrontations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Dharam Raj, a great manager who had the ability to handle political considerations with sensitivity, is now discovering the fragility of human relationships. <sep><sep> To do this exercise, he needs to consult the community that each deputy he has declared on his form, he needs to consult the latest population census in Mauritius where everyone had to classify themselves by community. <sep><sep> This year, he ended up ordering the Alliance Sociale government that was elected in 2005. <sep><sep> The Blueprint and VRS laws should be amended to ensure that every worker gets a piece of land to diversify plantations, based on collective ownership. <sep><sep> This will create many employment opportunities in Mauritius, not just in the countryside. <sep><sep> There is a big mural with the words Che spoke, what Marx said, what Castro said, showing that more interesting things are in contrast to public displays. <sep><sep> Then sit Boolell, who has many political ambitions, has a queue of supporters, which has always been there since his father's time. <sep><sep> There are other protesters (a 100-year-old who was excommunicated from this public garden). <sep><sep> There are all kinds of serious family dramas like lagers and even gruesome crimes. <sep><sep> So, today, this PT is not even mainstream, even if it represents fairly defined classes (compared to MMM which lost its way representing the classes it represents!!). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is the reason, why in 1951 they created the Action Group, which will become the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) and later the Mauritian Party and after the Social Democratic Mauritian Party (PMSD). <sep> <sep> At the same time, Laloo Chedee should have marched with capital to ensure that Mauritius succeeded in starting its own wage system he proposed a special "patriotic" block with capitalists. <sep> <sep> He had a policy to unite the working class as a class, and the vision to abolish the work system for a wage. <sep> <sep> The Workers' Historical Block is no longer playing during the current systemic crisis, even though Ramgoolam is trying to connect the sugar sector syndicalist with him. planters and establishment. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen explained the weaknesses that exist in the position of Sir. <sep> <sep> municipal councilors from 4 municipalities, parents-teachers associations (PTA), and educational associations such as Education for Workers. <sep> <sep> In Ut 79, there were some people who were not really prepared to face some consequences like dismissal, like repression. <sep> <sep> Dharam Chandee, who had also lost his job when he was very young, ended up resorting to the informal sector. <sep> <sep> Ashok Subron and Veena Dholah say their job, that's it. <sep> <sep> If we look at the MMM Program for the 1976 elections, we notice that the MMM started to overcome itself because of 'working arrangement with the bourgeoisie, started to choose a path that would satisfy the bourgeoisie, even though it was conflictual. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A single question, commentator burzwa is forced to question the capitalist system. <sep><sep> The anticipated general elections of 1987 made Bérenger per. <sep><sep> And then after the sharing of power 3an Jugnauth, 2an Berenger. <sep><sep> The Porlwi District Court was very lively when we had to come for our case. <sep><sep> If you, as a trade union movement, if you accept this logic, all you'll be able to say is, "Very well, Sir!". <sep><sep> He said that for more than a month, we have been doing door-to-door visits and distributing a leaflet to ask for votes in constituency number 7 on all these key issues during the electoral campaign. <sep><sep> - We propose a Parliament where there are 75 Members. <sep><sep> After the vote, both the union and the employers have claimed various amendments. <sep><sep> When illegal employment is used, there is a class bias that many people have found, have been realized. <sep><sep> The Opposition Members walked out, although they didn't disagree on any legal point. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not everyone knows what kind of sugar campaign was there before 1972. <sep> And you will expose in the future, just like the actions of Great Britain 40-50 years ago and question in the British Court and just like they will expose and question in the European Court of Human Rights shortly. <sep> It is for this reason that I will try to demonstrate why, despite the contents of the books, it is only the Playgroup that took the initiative to prepare this material. <sep> In textiles as well, there is a threat of massive closure of factories: through outsourcing to other countries, and through companies that go bankrupt because they cannot compete with the competition from large Asian producers. <sep> And when we can see the serious violations of the IBA guidelines with which they had agreed, what did they do? <sep> They understood it, they did it, within their limits. <sep> Lindsey Collen referred to the fact that problems caused by certain Western ideologies, including ones like Huntingdon, where there is a clash between civilization and religion. <sep> When there is a proliferation of confederations, it weakens the working class a lot. <sep> Even if the debate has not yet taken center stage on the issue of the working class having control over the use of land, what to plant on it, and what kind of production to have. <sep> meaning that there is a sharing with the state bourgeoisie (the capitalists themselves, who have been and are being destroyed in the bourgeoisie through state power) and possibly with a minor bourgeoisie (contractors, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, large landowners). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>So bacial observations on how police brutality operate their operations and, with their permission, we are publishing it as an article. <sep><sep> But, it was not good for LPT, nor was it good for LALIT when there was this kind of lack of clarity in the period of time. <sep><sep> When Xavier Duval came, he truly abolished the Capital Gains Tax on real estate, tax on dividends and interest, and also extended the Tax Holiday for Freeport employers. <sep><sep> so Lerop can no longer afford to continue to subsidize agricultural production, especially in sectors concerning Mauritius directly, on sugar products. <sep><sep> - Uncle, how can we get news on what's happening in the imperial field? - I have some contacts. <sep><sep> Netanyahu even had the nerve to say in his speech at the United Nations that Israel and Palestine together are too small to be divided in the airspace. <sep><sep> You are forcing children to choose their religion, to enter another group. <sep><sep> LALIT is there to provide direction, come up with a mobilization program to strengthen the working class in this struggle, and lastly, for the working class to take power. <sep><sep> So since March of this year, we have made a lot of efforts to put things in order and the political office, and the Central Committee, an item to restart the functioning of the youth group and to put a law in place for that. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen concluded by saying that this is truly what we are working on together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Questioning the existing mode of production, overturning the way production is organized, capitalist appropriation of all means of production. <sep> <sep> And the PMSD has never defined this democratization strategy of the economy, which aims to broaden the capitalist class base and allow for a new bourgeois state, contrary to the PTr's emergence. <sep> <sep> So, the error lies in believing that Marx is not an ecologist or an anti-ecologist, he is more of a Stalinist phenomenon. <sep> <sep> This warning was very clear to everyone present at the conference. <sep> <sep> A problem, whether looking for a solution or simply addressing the issue, and at the same time trying to reduce the problem in a way where the root of the problem is exposed. <sep> <sep> We find that there has been a resurgence of reactions based on communal and casteism after this revival. <sep> <sep> I am here as a language lover, also concerned with language teacher training. <sep> <sep> However, all political parties in power since Independence have ultimately realized that the media has targeted them. <sep> <sep> But what people do not realize is that nowadays, in many countries, treatment with medication, meaning with pills, has become more common than treatment with serious interventions. <sep> <sep> Ultimately, universal suffrage, property classes, bourgeoisie, it was not against clean universal suffrage, it was against reverse universal suffrage. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it's not so important which language you introduce as a second or third language. <sep> The use of the mother tongue in the education system and the municipal system is in favor of cooperation, counteracting the competitive system. <sep> And Pravind Jugnauth has not been elected in Number 11, while the leader has been out of Parliament. <sep> People are going down in numbers, but with no program, rather to denounce a system that dominates people, that breaks people, and to denounce a society being destroyed by financial capital, namely by banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and the like. <sep> Tipol and Zanzan who are in sixth grade (Tipol is failing) cannot read, write or count. <sep> What ancestral values? The suffering, the martyrdom that my grandmother endured? <sep> Then, on the 16th and 17th, Radio Plus reported Ashok Subron's resignation as a "news bulletin." <sep> The same evening, there was an exclusive dinner at Rs500 at Domaine Anna (for the bourgeoisie and upper-middle class contributing to FCM) plus a Rs50 discount on curry leaf soup in Bambous (for workers and poor people contributing). <sep> This same systemic crisis, the same class conflict between the oligarchy and other sections of the bourgeoisie, have put the poor MMM and Berenger in a knockout. <sep> In Kiba, there is more calm, and there is deeper, more profound. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The class struggle is neither a political struggle nor a trade union struggle. <sep> So we can guess that Paloma wants to go to the beach by himself and dive into the world of Diego without Diego. <sep> But where we'll take a position that the CIA finds correct in these "virtual" groups. <sep> For a while, there were scientists who were attracting attention from authorities at the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels, which were too high for life to unfold normally. <sep> Even though we have reference to his own way of staggering to measure: your growth rate of 4.2% which the PT-PMSD government announced has been re-estimated to be as low as 4.0%, and now they are predicting a figure of 3.3%. <sep> They may well appreciate, as yesterday we all appreciate, certain elements particularly in the everyday life of Mauritians - which Raymond Williams describes as 'ordinary culture' - that have extraordinary value. <sep> 2 interesting points, then, to discuss: On religion, and on energy, electricity. Where we find how this can happen, how communalism is there, then because it encourages, it worsens. <sep> We have to overturn this same State that the current government is part of. <sep> When he doesn't speak, he makes the MSM angry. <sep> Maybe we doubt as we surface the sea, but where land, no. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and Lerope is preparing to reduce the cost of electricity by 39% in the next 4 years, and the seaweed is still a problem in the sugar industry. <sep><sep> Two American nuclear submarines USS Houston and USS Corpus Christi have lost their way. <sep><sep> We have more potential allies than before: the British and American people have started to question in large numbers the legality and morality of their governments when they separated Chagos from Mauritius before Mauritius gained independence in 1968. <sep><sep> Despite how much they can explain why the farmer, the government farmer, inflated trucks, dockers very often violent, and a sense of loyalty and of the same, even if they work well. <sep><sep> When I look at the pavement, I see the dirty water that runs. <sep><sep> Today this fragmented union movement is slowly tearing the Ramgoolam government apart. <sep><sep> It slightly this capitalist problem also makes world letter law. <sep><sep> There is no guarantee that there will not be further reductions until the price it offers is at the same level as the price on the world market. <sep><sep> But, the first time we hear it and others say it. <sep><sep> This courage to work here, when you sell it, it becomes like a product with a price. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kimanyer arrives in a situation where a large class of workers, a class of influential workers, support our program. <sep><sep> -Sam Wainwright from DSP on the history of class struggles in Australia. <sep><sep> While he was encouraging economic development with America, the Ptr regime did not hesitate to suppress all forms of protest in favor of the inhabitants of the Chagos and to suppress all demonstrations against the Diego base. <sep><sep> This means that IPPs (Independent Power Producers) will have a guarantee in energy production for another generation thanks to the personal advice of the Prime Minister, Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> Timi and Balram had decided to cultivate their land in order to feed themselves and their future children. <sep><sep> There is a branch of Rozbel, which meets weekly for independence and has many members. <sep><sep> You are calling a worker and if you tell him his work has value, you must take into account all social insurances, next to it; meaning what level of laws you will offer him; what level of education you will provide him. <sep><sep> According to us, there is a lack of a long-term vision and until now they have not set up a clear strategic plan to create jobs quickly. <sep><sep> We also find that in the last three months, the work carried out by Lalit in the campaign to free Diego continues. <sep><sep> There is a declaration in the Road Map regarding the diversification of agriculture beyond sugar cane on a large scale that has not succeeded in the past. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And given that class activities must bring this challenge to bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> When you give an appointment, you keep it, and your friend knows you will keep it. <sep><sep> Some models to include: Politics Language; Multi-langue Mainly Zenez; Mother Tongue Based Multi-Lingual Education; Modern Pedagogy; Ways of writing in Morisyen Creole. <sep><sep> A special appeal to universities that support students studying their mother tongue to strengthen it. <sep><sep> If we do this, we will not go far. <sep><sep> In Mauritius also, we are finding this nationalist trend, through slogans like "Me, 100% Mauritian". <sep><sep> It’s really a matter that calls for the law, because you can find it normal to fast, and the law says you have to pay a fee. <sep><sep> There is a philosophical problem here, the boss will say, "If we make more profits, workers will get more hay." <sep><sep> Especially, in 1997-98, we attacked in the Supreme Court this "Privatization Fund" which started to stock capital from the privatization of Mauritius Telecom when it gave its shares. <sep><sep> Here, there is a new phase of politicization characterized by a Ladies' Pool Reunion where GRC is starting to become a force again. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During a press conference, Pierre Joson, spokesperson, mentioned that former workers of Lesid disabled faced the possibility of demonstrations and other peaceful actions in the upcoming days. <sep><sep> Waiting as a trap, heavy with pain and tears, finally enveloped the resistance in despair. <sep><sep> He will return with his Drachma, which he believes will assist at a level equivalent to a massive devaluation. <sep><sep> it started in the cities in Lenor England such as Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle - all names of football teams in the English League. <sep><sep> Diego - for the first time, under pressure from LALIT (and once again, our opposing allies), the government has taken a case to an international Tribunal. <sep><sep> even within the Labour Party in England, under its leader Tony Blair since 1997, in the PS under Mitterand (opposing until 1995) and its successes. <sep><sep> When there is a debate on PRB, we find that this fragmentation in the civil service. <sep><sep> Creole as a Foreign Language LPT has conducted 3 courses of 8 weeks with 3 different foreign groups learning Creole, 2 Granbe, and a Rivyer Nwar. <sep><sep> The Trade Union Movement, as it forms part of Mauritian society, also enters this crisis period and faces the consequences of this crisis. <sep><sep> Moreover, there is a bourgeoisie in power, namely an investor section, who feel hindered today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Working Government seems to be moving forward with the introduction of mother tongue. <sep><sep> So Wednesday's session helped us develop our ideas on the Program, where the ideological, educational, and economic aspects were discussed. <sep><sep> For workers, as Lindsey mentioned earlier, especially during the late 1920s until 1935-1936, when there was a major economic crisis in Mauritius. <sep><sep> We have the advantage that Mauritius is a small island so our agriculture can be protected from GMO contamination. <sep><sep> Ramgoolam made it clear that he has no intention of participating in a legal process without the consent of the party, meaning without MMM's agreement. <sep><sep> He emphasized truth and when the truth comes out, it was too late to do anything. <sep><sep> PMSD supports the new labor law proposed by Bunwaree, which will give more freedom to employers to exploit workers. <sep><sep> We have heard many union leaders talking about the need for a labor law that "protects workers". <sep><sep> We all arrived in Mauritius through sugar cane, in a certain way. <sep><sep> Kamini, a young woman of about twenty, was sitting at the back of the cathedral. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If our program says we must retrieve property from them, retrieve who owns and controls the land, most workers will agree. <sep> <sep> We will succeed in closing this colony down. <sep> <sep> This helped us understand a lot of things about the State: <sep> <sep> all our members year after year have contributed to the association and its development <sep> <sep> It also gives an idea of how much he has witnessed this emotional music, which so strongly evokes the presence of a mother in his home. <sep> <sep> He is a front-liner where all sorts of members of all sorts of political paths. <sep> <sep> And it is more important today that there is this kind of political party. <sep> <sep> This particular link is especially I believe between political leadership and the working class avant-garde. <sep> <sep> If TCSB finds that it is not justified, the employer must either rehire the worker or pay 120 days severance pay and 6 times the annual compensation. <sep> <sep> We are, it is a clear bee and it is a very ambitious bee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You can have a country where there has been dictatorship for over 30 years, plus, in one single cut, you hear there has been a huge, massive revolt. <sep><sep> Immediately, we put that plan into action. <sep><sep> Bizlall continued to do work to re-establish a public sector union through what he called 'liberated sectors'. <sep><sep> For example, if there are, 100 workers in a company that gets VRS and gets a portion each, then, together they exploit 100 portions to diversify plantations. <sep><sep> Electoral Reform: For an electoral system where neither the population nor the deputies are classified by town, a generalized electoral reform is needed, where a proportional dose replaces institutionalized communalism. <sep><sep> It is only the PMSD that was acting like a true imperialist agent in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Venezuela provides Cuba with oil, and Cuba provides people with experience, like doctors. <sep><sep> So, here, where this kind of confusion needs to be clarified. <sep><sep> Even the 39% reduction proposed by the European Union is not for preferential prices since the prices available from Europe and the prices available on the world market. <sep><sep> So, every person who uses social networks like Facebook needs to realize this dance that entrepreneurs make profits through the popularity of Facebook and its data. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We had a huge demonstration 'La Marche Du Pain' in Quatre Bornes in 2006 against the new labor law. <sep> According to LALIT, his dance has a tendency to win bed bugs. <sep> It is problematic, given that MMM does not oppose foreign military bases on Mauritian territory. <sep> In Laswed there are many people who are bilingual: Swedish and English. <sep> On the other hand, Minister Gokhool did not mention the important issue of pre-primary education where many children do not know how to read/write. <sep> Ramou decided that he will not taste alcohol until he dies; Ramba was against women drinking alcohol; Balram only had a small whiskey. <sep> For workers, their main concerns are salary increases, better working conditions. <sep> The Jericho's western face fell into the sea and its natural beauty has had great strategic and political importance. <sep> Today, if it is not elected, it will not be there. <sep> They do not find it immoral when it comes to people's access to water - a basic necessity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But suddenly, no one seems to be taking notice. <sep><sep> Introduction When people write about the history of Chagos, they often claim that history has happened without any Chagossians being involved. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy said that LALIT will campaign in issue number 8 to demand a vote on our platform. <sep><sep> Yesterday on the MMM land was protesting against the English colonialists (anti-Alexandra protest in 1969), against the American imperialism (anti-Vietnam war protest in 1970). <sep><sep> If you get the wording of the Official Secrets Act of England, if someone works for MI5 or if he is an officer, he swears allegiance to the Queen until today. <sep><sep> When the Taliban comes to power in Afghanistan, they introduced servitude (which is a longstanding social tradition in that region), they banned music, education for girls and women, and forbid women from seeing a doctor. <sep><sep> The tourism sector is increasingly replacing establishments such as the Burgeois political section: its Minister controls restaurants, discos, public spaces (even where clotheslines are placed). <sep><sep> All dispensaries are full, all doctors in Lari Desforges exhausted, and the government is struggling with epidemics. <sep><sep> The history of Mauritius and the history of Chagos, the history of America and the history of England, force us to express ourselves in this way. <sep><sep> -There is panic emigration, already. It creates a situation that may seem strange, especially when there are many workers coming from outside Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that time, there are intermediate classes which are more parental with working classes, or more parental with the bourgeoisie that owns any production, depending on time, depending on other factors ankor. <sep><sep> For the first time, the Government of Mauritius officially received a representative of B.I.O.T. <sep><sep> Now, we need to quickly close or stabilize the welfare state, because this will give an advantage to "certain service providers". <sep><sep> The first PMSD that the Government, both Ramjuttun will play a play at La Louise there. <sep><sep> But it is precisely the political escape of Hurnam that is attracting more attention today. <sep><sep> And since we are also (he is in our program) to develop the Creole language in its formal form, we have published books in Creole. <sep><sep> we put the emphasis totally on "alternative economy" in the textile French zone. <sep><sep> In particular, they have identified precise procedures for Multinational companies in different countries to enter into SOCIAL SERVICE through the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that is part of the WTO. <sep><sep> And furthermore they have started quarreling with "invented capital", in English they say "fictitious". <sep><sep> What we criticize a lot, what LALIT and other revolutionary socialist parties around the world have denounced, has become something that Sarkozy could criticize. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the police have clearly strongly discouraged all sectors from going in that direction. <sep><sep> Yesterday there is a partial election financing in Rivyer di Ranpar as well as another partial in Triolet/Pamplemous which allows Hurnam to exercise power to paralyze the tendencies in the MMM which would have preferred Hurnam to disappear from their party. <sep><sep> We need to differentiate between what was committed as a crime, UK and US, and what was complicit, namely political leaders who participated in discussions at Lancaster House in London. <sep><sep> Is the solution to the crisis in the Security Industry to transform it into a Sugar Industry, where other products such as ethanol or electricity can be developed from bagasse? <sep><sep> and also it is more possible to make European consumers pay 3 times more than on the world market. <sep><sep> So Ashok Subron has developed another strategy for him to represent the new trade unions that have just been established in Rodrigues. <sep><sep> From the outset, we inherit a system, thus, which condemns a majority of children to become adults who will find a job at the dock. <sep><sep> And today, following the impulse of PT, more than 40% of workers work in these sectors are also insecure, and banks will also work. <sep><sep> We must succeed in bringing a new system, a more rational, democratic, egalitarian system, without any form of discrimination and repression. <sep><sep> Today, even Israel's armed forces have left Gaza, Israel continues to block Gaza. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And when you come out, if you have not managed to restore yourself in a viable life, you become a deadly dancer for society as a whole. <sep> <sep> When he will come to sell the bay leaf, he will sell it for Rs100, Rs200, Rs300 million. <sep> <sep> The government is looking at it as an economic crisis, one that is passing. <sep> <sep> LALIT is writing a letter to the Minister of Justice to take a position on the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions. <sep> <sep> In the field of informatics, it is not just a diploma that matters because it is a field that is constantly changing, what matters is the ability to develop programs and innovate. <sep> <sep> It was not by accident that Lalit and MLF were together in this phase: these two organizations believe in the importance of people's auto-activity being oppressed, like a listless engine. <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee was on Radio Plus on 2 September discussing the Palestine issue. <sep> <sep> In our program for this election, LALIT is proposing an alternative economy based on agricultural diversification and agro-industrial development, measures that can create jobs quickly. <sep> <sep> At that time, after 5 days of the fuel strike, the month of November I felt I still had the energy to serve, we went, we helped out the Vacoas Transport garage, we pulled the buses. <sep> <sep> just polemics, just political criticism of the government and opportunism of parliamentary opposition. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Unfortunately, the sugarcane industry is facing a more serious problem than in 2006. <sep><sep> And when Rajni Lallah was finally on a two-year program on the economy, half of it was abruptly cut off, during the program. <sep><sep> Can Kamini balance the books? The books, really? She talks about her problem with Dharam Raj. <sep><sep> He was bringing it to where he had decided to go. <sep><sep> The date and place they had chosen: the 10th anniversary of 9/11, on Maiden Island, Plas Darm. <sep><sep> We need to keep in mind what is happening to desperate men. <sep><sep> MSPA is supposed to come forward with a proposal to unlock the overall situation, and St Felix has taken a wrong turn. <sep><sep> In many corners of the world, it is the ruling classes, the bourgeoisie in different continents, in different countries together with the state, that are on the offensive. <sep><sep> Instead of denouncing the violence used by the police, Paul Berenger has given a reward for police violence. <sep><sep> Lalit is entirely in solidarity with the workers and trade union militants in FPU and FTU, who have suffered police violence. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The shiny police car that Rama Valayden was driving was actually Jean Marie Richard's. <sep> <sep> This signifies another fragility in food production. <sep> <sep> Until the security industry reset started coming out of the European and global markets and were seeing it's quiet, it didn't bring too much conflict. <sep> <sep> If you remain calm, barely interested, the Prime Minister will offer you a ticket to pose here. <sep> <sep> In 1971, Ramesh Khaytoo led a completely different movement in Tablisman Anna. <sep> <sep> Now, when the working class has been weakened enough by economic realities, ERA is starting to overturn that reality. <sep> <sep> For more than 60 years the Palestinian people living in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem are facing military occupation and colonization. <sep> <sep> we demand the emancipation of women that has been born through the women's movement. <sep> <sep> And we will build support on the mobilization that we have gained through ongoing campaigns that have already started. <sep> <sep> Not just the economy but that was the slogan on their newspapers, always a price, where they put a date and price. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is the CSC which insists on no longer calling Chagossians by their former appellation, which has developed a derogatory connotation, namely "Zilwa". <sep><sep> When young people mobilize as an oppressed group, that is when they may be able to truly fight communalism. <sep><sep> They will say, you know us, we are Mauritians, we live the 'Mauritianism' way of life. <sep><sep> It has also led to many calls on the radio, saying "Lalit has a place in Beau Bassin for the First of May". <sep><sep> During the National Assembly discussions on Tuesday, 23 October, Ramgoolam unveiled another side of his desperate strategy: restarting discussions with the MMM on the electoral reform issue. <sep><sep> and its compatibility with human rights as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Covenants on Social, Economic & Cultural Rights. <sep><sep> They say he was given a new title that allowed him to enter the adult world. <sep><sep> The colonizers used to classify people, like here, based on their appearance and lineage. <sep><sep> The FTU seems to have left the CSG, they have joined forces with the CTSP and Bizlall. <sep><sep> They have sometimes downplayed or even ignored the geo-political and economic interests present in this region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Why doesn't he call his supervisor to update his reading. <sep> <sep> What this means is that his culture is not something external that "leaves" or even "invites", but rather something that is part of life. <sep> <sep> Territorial inhabitants occupied by Palestinians continue to dwell on their land, cultivate their olive trees and resist against walls, against military occupation. <sep> <sep> To contribute to this, the Port Louis association has made a donation of Rs1,000. <sep> <sep> This cause  There is No Alternative  (TINA) had become a popular slogan. <sep> <sep> Insecurity at work (precariousness), in social life (constant miserable conditions, isolation in poverty, labor and terrorist misery. <sep> <sep> According to Jonathan Ravat, from the ICJM, this report asked these families for their opinion on access to education, laws, cleanliness and social services, and these "poor" people have expressed their opposition to the introduction of Creole as a medium. <sep> <sep> 15 years ago, the situation was different, and Ziz Rault would have interpreted it differently. <sep> <sep> meanwhile, the International Labour Office (ILO) has found it even more difficult to implement this union strategy. <sep> <sep> It is not surprising that the PT is facing difficulties in publicly announcing its position on electoral reform, especially since neither its Political Bureau nor its Central Committee have met since May 1st! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This confidence could be initially based on productivity relatively higher than in the USA, but it is no longer true. <sep><sep> This is because WTO regulations are benefiting small farmers, not only in Asia but also in Latin America. <sep><sep> In 2006, he said, imports amounted to Rs10 billion of nutrients. <sep><sep> Further imposing a quota for these large countries. <sep><sep> With all-inclusive tourism where every tourist pays for everything before arrival, it does not go into small businesses, small restaurants, nothing. <sep><sep> We found that Berenger, MMM, and Lapres are conducting a special campaign. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, on September 23, he signed, I am saying these two anecdotes, Ramadan evening, September 23, Saturday night, Ramadan evening, because today is the day after Ramadan, 30 years after. <sep><sep> Nobody wants to eat!" Until cartoonists find it funny to say. <sep><sep> Now he is looking to install a new base in Africa. <sep><sep> This kind of repression against an artist and a social worker is unacceptable. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Rose-Belle Police had issued a search warrant for "Rogue and Vagabond" against Roland Fozoo and D. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, centralization of mills and mechanization in sugar cane fields has accelerated, supposedly to reduce production, but it is yet again the working class that is carrying the burden, as there is destruction of livelihoods for artisans and laborers. <sep><sep> One day they had heard a faint moan, as if a woodlouse was trying to speak. <sep><sep> In Barcelona, the troops barricaded themselves, they put a veil over every face. <sep><sep> The disparity between a worker with a Work Permit being 2 to 3 times less for the same job in the same area compared to an Israeli worker. <sep><sep> The strength comes from the integrity of the class it represents. <sep><sep> It is because since the time of the Ramgoolam Government, it is a government whose economic policies are to make the capitalist system work well. <sep><sep> In the 'Unity' feast. of May 1st, 2008, what happened? <sep><sep> The first question is "What is a citizen?" The second question is "What is the law?" and the third question that arises is "What relationship exists between citizen and law?". <sep><sep> You find where gluttony and greed have led us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MFL believes that the famine-policy must not be part of the combinations in the communal councils like the "best loser" communal councils. <sep> <sep> The Social Alliance has already been shaken by its bench-bencher proposals. <sep> <sep> The LPT has its prizes of positions, its lobbying, and it makes its petitions, its actions. <sep> <sep> But, before that, there were enough beds to sit in the elections, there were beds, big beds in the 1921 elections, after the 1921 elections there were big beds between supporters of the Liberal Action and people throwing stones at Oligarchs. <sep> <sep> For a long time, certainly since before the general elections, and we had dedicated our electoral campaign to this question, we have resubmitted the question of sugar and disik production. <sep> <sep> The PMSD has also had people in its fold people in the lumpen, like somer and people sitting in illegal trafficking. <sep> <sep> And also, rights and property owner, which is a more serious matter. <sep> <sep> For a long time people wanted to bring it, we have no illusions that they, or others, have what it takes to bring such a victory, by themselves. <sep> <sep> It avoids going into a demonstration against an incinerator, organized by an institution that wants an IRS here! <sep> <sep> And yet the MSM has often reduced its funding - Sun Trust. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He took a position against the increase in tax on the disc. <sep> Alain Ah-Vee also explained how the UK and US are taking care of Diego for their economic and military interests. <sep> He shows ordinary life in Palestine, and in every picture of Garo Nalabandian, an exceptional photographer, you find a cultural clash expressed in the everyday life of people in Jerusalem: <sep> In the neighborhood, he will bring threats, make peace, build universities. <sep> He praised what he called "essential political work" that Lalit has been doing since 2004, and he remarked that "there is no sector in which Lalit has no position". <sep> And this building is shared by LPT and Lalit. <sep> Equality that we seek is an equality that can only be achieved when class distinctions are abolished. <sep> PWU has "graduated" because politically, it has become too strong. <sep> From its greatest economist who criticizes capitalist corporations to commenting on ordinary life as editorials of Mauritius. <sep> A Ministry of Education conflict, a phase of a crisis, is necessary for all of its Ministerial staff concerned and all of its MIE staff concerned, to study this crisis, and to study the documents that created this crisis, with the idea that in the future the Minister should stop acting like children. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Isn't he being put in a precarious position by making him alive? <sep><sep> At the age of fifty, Jamouna started having health problems. <sep><sep> So, LALIT says that if you think well, you need to rethink your political ideology. <sep><sep> Moreover, we find that there is a struggle between the two Ministers, Soodun and Bappoo, we even find that there is a struggle over the leadership of the movement. <sep><sep> What he was doing was that a language (like English here) should not necessarily become the medium of instruction for a child to learn it well. <sep><sep> Even a new Constitution was proposed by an organization that was auto-erased in March. <sep><sep> There are people who act in a way that provokes poverty, that provokes communalism, but who adore the national anthem, yet they live in their huge, grand buildings. <sep><sep> The Government boasted in its budget speech about the Lawman, but during its term, it did not even clean the gutters of the houses that its Finance Minister promised to clean every year. <sep><sep> The State must ensure very often that there is no disorder, rebellion, chaos which, in turn, makes it harder to serve this exploitative system. <sep><sep> We learned these two crimes from the Lutte Ouvriere in France. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Will the boss become more strong and arrogant, or will the working class have more means to defend the economic and social rights we already have.<sep> There are 500,000 refugees living in shanties in the slums of London and Paris.<sep> Will you spend on transport to reimburse, or will the boss provide transportation for the workers.<sep> That young thug was lurking around when everyone was asleep.<sep> With whom? - Don't tell me you don't know, Tantinn.<sep> In 1996, immediately after the assault, Lindsey Collen said how Berenger was on TV washing election laundry and he clearly blamed Cehl Meeah.<sep> However, we don't know much more than what was in one short article in the newspapers.<sep> Berenger and Jugnauth have become representatives of big capitalists - Mauritian and imperialists.<sep> And when Wisye Lakur came to finally remove his "protege," there was a violent struggle where police and Jean Marie Richard were involved.<sep> In a campaign speech, on the 12th of January at Mama Tuke, Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam confessed that his father previously and now, backed Secretary Lindistri, as a political strategy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Three weeks ago, Trwa Sadou decided to go to Princess Prathna's family in a large forest where they were able to take care of her education and prepare her to face the future and allow her to see the sun's rays through the screen of poisonous gas. <sep><sep> He produced committees, "recovery committees", solidarity committees. <sep><sep> What to plant, and what to do with the produce? <sep><sep> But, he said, there must be a common reaction to the results. <sep><sep> The class struggle is entirely based on the reality of people: Reality is a plantation, when there is resistance, a worker can face a company, or its employer. <sep><sep> Ironically, after Minister Boolell showed that the strategy of focusing solely on bilateral negotiations had been a failure, Paul Berenger, of the MMM party, said that his party's strategy had not changed for 10 years. <sep><sep> What we expect from a political party is that it takes a clear political stance, it takes a principled position. <sep><sep> They argue as if all parties in the mainstream should come together: MMM, PT, MR, MSM, PMSD, PMXD, etc. <sep><sep> In other words, we should not merely "get" a film, as we normally do in the cinema, but "envision" it. <sep><sep> This means that it should be more than twice as frequent as it already is. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The drastic increase in the price of necessities due to the illegal protection declared by the European Union has had a significant impact. <sep> When preparing to attend the Ut 79 strike, discussions about the weaknesses and strengths of the trade union movement, for example, when a union's leadership appears weak, we cannot rely on them. <sep> Several witnesses who shared their experiences shed tears of emotion, showing their deep feelings, and this, apparently, is a defining feature of a major protest movement such as this one, which lasted for three weeks. <sep> Then, when we meet Rima, we find Rima coming in, just as we found Ton Auguste coming in, we know there is a problem. <sep> But, in a time when workers are mobilizing, disappearing like we are today, in a crisis, things can change quickly. <sep> Hence, we must look forward, in this era of change, finding ways to bring progress. <sep> Firstly, there is no analysis in these traditional methods for dealing with these major crises. <sep> This time, in 1979, it was a challenge organized by the working class, followed by strikes in prison. <sep> In the past, this was somewhat the case in Zone Francaise, but now it's less so, but today it is more common in the BPO-ICT sector where workers are fighting for themselves. <sep> This is how it happened that someone left the country with a suitcase containing Rs300 million. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in a sense, once again, we are discussing the evening of "socialism versus barbarism". <sep><sep> Ideas that emerged during this meeting were both dangerous and immediate for the family unit, and for everyday family life, when there is a rise of communalism, racism, and fundamentalism. <sep><sep> - Why did Berenger say "it's just a small piece of Crown Land" when Ganoo gave him a part of land in an irregular manner? <sep><sep> Regarding the climate as well, we don't know when we will reach a "point of no return", but this moment may be approaching fast. <sep><sep> The cut-off day, when the UN Committee for Human Rights was out, sparked an interesting debate: The Committee gave RA the reason, stating that it was right not to grant permission to eliminate their candidates because they did not include the community in their Nomination Paper for the general elections. <sep><sep> In the case of Air Mauritius, a scheme has been organised, with two trade unionists taking part. <sep><sep> When these two sides became news again, they had a temporary breakdown in their relationship. <sep><sep> The mobilization campaign that the LALIT Party is leading has put forward a program for an Alternative Economy in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Reefing in Board, court, commission, ministry. The working class was relatively strong, so strong that the State had to put it in an industrial relations context. <sep><sep> Our campaign is focused on the demands that we have developed over the past few years. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Business owners have a monopoly on a twenty-year agreement to run a sugar cane plantation, with operations in 4 key areas: nursery, refinery, ethanol, electricity - they want to use their monopoly position to maximize profits. <sep><sep> Very carefully planned: a bulldozer to clear the land, a crane to gather the olives, plastic bags to store the olives, empty roads or fields to break the olives that are too ripe. <sep><sep> However, the threat on the table gives us an idea of the kind of repression it could involve. <sep><sep> Personally, I do not agree with the fact that Dharam Raj is a thug. <sep><sep> OMT-FNAS Dev Ramano and FMP Jack Bizlall have formed in PMT, which has since disappeared as if no one has explained or noticed. <sep><sep> L'Estrac is assuming that the MMM, under Berenger's leadership, cannot satisfy this "representation". <sep><sep> LALIT's policy is based on the interest of all those who work to live, against the interests of those who live on capital, live on rent, on dividends. <sep><sep> To exacerbate the situation, by doing one thing, that is, imposing a tax on this financial capital movement, the Tobin Tax. <sep><sep> The terrain is so difficult that even the military might have difficulties, only donkeys can pass that trail. <sep><sep> Sunday continued to take care of Timi and his family until God called him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and we also put the emphasis on "the program," a program on which a political party acts, a program through which it seeks a radical transformation in society in general. <sep><sep> MMM, while it, seems to have lost power as it seems to have been taken over by big capitalists ("IMF conditions," it announced, "representing the essence of economic management" - Berenger). <sep><sep> And what the experts are proposing now will exacerbate the crisis. <sep><sep> They have only received the value of a raw zucchini. <sep><sep> It is also necessary to mention the PMSD campaign to detach Rodrig from Mauritius. <sep><sep> The Jugnauth Plan (ERCP) has now been announced to be aimed restructuring that will bring licensing, but without devaluation of the rupee. <sep><sep> "Gaza is like a prison under bombardment," he said. <sep><sep> And working-class people are still in a precarious position, unfortunately, to challenge that. <sep><sep> Everyone takes a big hubcap goal and puts it in front of them. <sep><sep> To say that the Medine sugar estate that has a cane field today on it is agricultural land, the government just needs to sign a paper to turn the land into residential land. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "I AM SCREAMING ENOUGH!" Today, the Government Plan and the Employer Network and its Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS) are being questioned. <sep><sep> But everything he does is to make people believe him, MMM doesn't represent that community. <sep><sep> -42% of workers work for small businesses, meaning 80% will close after 3-4 years of existence. It's concerning. <sep><sep> We don't want people associating us with such a lack of integrity. <sep><sep> Article GN 230 states: "Every Association shall: 8(a) keep its books, documents or records in English or French or such other language as the Registrar may approve; <sep><sep> The rise of economic and military powers in relationships as China and Russia represents a direct threat to US capitalism. <sep><sep> After the PTR/MSM alliance collapse, Pravind Jugnauth met with Paul Berenger to discuss electoral reform, Navin Ramgoolam met with Jayen Cuttarree too. <sep><sep> We have formally requested a meeting with the organizers of the strike action. <sep><sep> There is another aspect where you need to explain the reasons why you are making this request. <sep><sep> Finally, workers are being encouraged to participate in their own exploitation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Those same bourgeois ideological leaders today are asking, "Can capitalism survive?" <sep><sep> But the government was unable to bring the law to the forefront because the trade union movement had merged into a common platform. <sep><sep> In the MMM team in 1976, only Berenger remained. <sep><sep> Due to the high sulfur and white sand, olive trees were blighted with a yellowish powder of sulfur and a reddish powder of rust. <sep><sep> He paid the price when there were inmates in prison, only after a major national strike movement in Mauritius. <sep><sep> He brought the newspaper. He made jokes, laughed. <sep><sep> Also, when we look at television after 2-3 weeks like this, we find that the crisis we are analyzing in Mauritius for a long time, we find that the world is suffering from it. <sep><sep> And Tuesday there will be Rajni Lallah along with Penny Duggan. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen was in Court with about 20 militants in solidarity with Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> Minister Choonee even came to justify the military presence here as a kind of Madagascar/French resettlement because the SMF coincidence was present in Paris. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We know that the Greek government did not anticipate an economic problem in the country when the event occurred.</sep><sep> It is amusing that electoral politics have become similar to "selling a product", meaning a "communication strategy" or in English, "spin", the role of the press has become important in elections.</sep><sep> Some have already noticed that all types of private universities are getting involved in Moris, landing or settling.</sep><sep> When Martin King turns his head, he looks like he is being watched by lightning so that no one can find his hiding place.</sep><sep> Instead of closing mills, converting to a leisure park to preserve the cold and vegetables.</sep><sep> But, there is a big religious celebration coming.</sep><sep> Its goal is “the coming together of all communities to create a Mauritian entity free from all distinctions of class, race, or religion.”</sep><sep> Being a union member, they pay their dues for the union to do its work.</sep><sep> and develop sufficient strength in the working class and oppressed class to challenge the capitalist kingdom itself.</sep><sep> Dear: Perhaps I need to make a comment from home, if you allow. When we come up with a new idea.</sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Let us be aware of the contradictions that exist today, which arise from our reality. <sep><sep> It is positive that the union movement is continuing until the employer recognizes the workers' rights and dances when the boss tries to change social security. <sep><sep> Paul Bérenger, in opposition, claims paternity of this corner. <sep><sep> This year marks 63 years since World War II and to commemorate this, on the 23rd of June, a ceremony was held in Okinawa. <sep><sep> We are talking about it constantly: for example, when we say: <sep><sep> (This immensity, it can be "great unity" like the current establishment, and also many "smaller unities" that work together, like a true cooperative.). <sep><sep> and all of this financed by different capitalist sections, each in different proportions by different sections; <sep><sep> International research has shown that it is an advantage for cognitive development when using the maternal language to show all the sizes. <sep><sep> Members of LALIT were invited to speak on the occasion of the International Family Nursing Week. <sep><sep> But, Wanted, when it was a bit of a disaster, in the era of all kinds of funny people were running the show - businessmen in marketing in the internet. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This was the time when the major movements of the local political sphere in the United States and France had just taken on a capitalist ideological economic approach. <sep><sep> We need to focus on the debate that the MLF has provoked towards a new program for women's liberation, a new manifesto. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Ram Seegobin finds it quite challenging for the Prime Minister to establish an alliance between now and the upcoming Parliamentary elections. <sep><sep> For Paul Berenger, there is no issue with the increase in prices, while the prices of essential items such as flour, oil, and sugar have recently experienced a rise. <sep><sep> And he noted that no journalists have come for the "Journalism Collection" anymore, except for a few on their personal behalf. <sep><sep> In Le Mauricien's Monday, 23rd September issue, it seems that the last statement made by Ashok Subron has sparked his departure from the ILO in Geneva, as Ashok Subron returns with arguments that he resigned because he disagreed. <sep><sep> You develop the Kreol language, and learn other languages afterwards, based on this development in the mother tongue. <sep><sep> While he was in intensive care at the hospital, there were always nurses keeping watch with love throughout the country. <sep><sep> You were telling me that if millions of people were to mobilize in movements like Occupy Wall Street, it would seem like a dream, unrealizable. <sep><sep> Historical bourgeoisie has a tendency to closely connect with power, especially when there is no political representation of the clergy in Parliament. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But more importantly, Timi was making contact. <sep><sep> a large sum of money was allocated to the State since the tax was collected, a large sum of foreign exchange reserves, reserves that in the past the State controlled. <sep><sep> K. a teacher from the UK was quite present just to support. <sep><sep> How is the Alliance Social government doing this today? <sep><sep> What kind of hypocrisy is it to talk about negotiation and peace while at the same time imposing colonial expansion on a territory whose future is supposed to be determined by bilateral negotiations? <sep><sep> You will find that her husband can "sweat" only because he, on the other hand, is obliged to sit in front of the law laid down by the employer. <sep><sep> So, when the decision was made to go on strike, all SILU-UASI branches had to meet, week after week, to choose a date. <sep><sep> Mauritius far from the food shortage, and many countries, one after the other, are barring exports. <sep><sep> At this stage, he had not yet offered a compromise with "all" bourgeois class, but only with "progressive bosses". <sep><sep> Sometimes he can't go to university because checkpoints are closed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the new guidelines, we need to follow the coming months. <sep><sep> Where the resources are used in a certain production, without expenses, it naturally recycles in the environment. <sep><sep> Also, it goes against the interests of the inhabitants of Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega, St. Brandon. <sep><sep> Surprised, Jean-Claude told the General Manager of the hotel that he would be happy to meet him. <sep><sep> The Medine 1970 Strike In 1970, there was a pearl strike. <sep><sep> What is needed today is a huge movement that mobilizes behind a political program that proposes an economic alternative, a new development that favors the inhabitants, not in the interest of a capitalist clan. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the government, the ruling class, and the neo-liberal "apostles" must stop thrusting us with their "inevitability" and their "Single Thought." <sep><sep> And we have taken pleasure in initiatives in the past 5 years: especially on the issue of appealing a case before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. <sep><sep> Just as there has been in the past against the apartheid regime in South Africa and as there is today against Israel. <sep><sep> The IRA Law, it's like a state dictating the Trade Union Movement and the Worker Class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT had a significant celebration of Labor Day, especially with enthusiasm after our Congress in February. <sep><sep> On the 8th day, the government initiated the Moody Commission, which it said will form the Village Council. <sep><sep> organizing correct activities that help people gain dignity, stop destroying themselves. <sep><sep> I understand that many family societies in the areas are somewhat like that, meaning the family article with the political article. <sep><sep> In short, all political and trade union initiatives from Bizlall since 1979 to date, for 30 years, have ended in catastrophe. <sep><sep> This multiplicity of organizations represents extraordinary strength, but at the same time in an ironic way, it may in certain circumstances represent a weak interior of this strength. <sep><sep> The Commission has almost succeeded in finding a member eating its lunch. <sep><sep> Are we all Mauritians, our language, to continue to be considered an inferior language, a language that is not written, not in books, since children enter Kindergarten, "Pre-primer": <sep><sep> Some precious families who had settled far away had finished up stronger. <sep><sep> So, the objective situation of the working class is equally serious; however, it is a time when the working class is becoming more creative, politically. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He asks for firsthand political experiences, books on political theories, and tactical capacity to confront this problem. <sep><sep> In a small village in the heart of Gondwana, in a small house surrounded by banana trees, a child was born. <sep><sep> Therefore, what is important is that a working-class party like LALIT needs to organize itself to keep its political work focused on a program in the interest of the workers. <sep><sep> "Another comrade Lenoir" on the same side as Jean Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front in France. <sep><sep> Another interesting content that caught my attention in certain articles in the book is the articles that show how the State reacts when it feels "threatened." <sep><sep> There was a column that was favoring sexual harassment from male workers to female workers, one by one, with the complicity of certain supervisors. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, there are already laws against all kinds of crimes, there are 10,000 police officers to defend victims, there is a DPP office that prosecutes, there are investigators to make accusations, there is prison for the guilty. <sep><sep> You produce, you earn money, then you go consume. <sep><sep> But, we must avoid using GMOs as opposition leader Berenger is proposing. <sep><sep> As a medium, this means not just as an oral support, (it is already being done,) We say that it must be shown in the mother tongue and in oral form and in its written form. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday the discussion was about food security, Rada talked about an alternative economy, meaning the systemic crisis that Mauritius has been going through for 5 years or more, what other economic alternatives are there? <sep><sep> Lalit calls on all villagers and city dwellers to protest. <sep><sep> Note that the minister who took a position against the blasphemy law, was assassinated within 48 hours. <sep><sep> Likewise, the statements Berenger is making when he enters these valleys of laughter. <sep><sep> We are satisfied that after our efforts, the IBA and private radios have rectified this. <sep><sep> It is time for us to address these empty slogans, devoid of meaning, such as "one people, one nation" or "I am 100% Mauritian, who are you?". <sep><sep> Karann should have prevented Karonn from losing his mind; Karann should have prevented Karonn from going completely mad. <sep><sep> And this situation that I am describing is completely new. <sep><sep> Comrade Ram: Comrade Patrick has raised an important point on CSR. <sep><sep> Thank you to Comrade Alain Ah-Vee for presiding over our meeting this morning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is strong in the USA. There, 9% of the US labor force who were employed are now unemployed. <sep><sep> The Creole Festival, the public beach, all these permits for all these businesses related to the tourism industry. <sep><sep> Yesterday, the measures that the Social Alliance has taken since it has been in power are consolidating the private sector, as we have never seen before. <sep><sep> At the same time, it continues to keep an eye on all the other sectors through its plans to return to the political arena with an alliance and MMM. <sep><sep> Importing capitalists who have interests that do not allow their currency to depreciate so that they can buy more expensive goods have found their representatives in Bheenick and Vayid. <sep><sep> either barbaric killing or a political revolution that is so integrated that it manages to create a new power, rearranging the economy in a different way. <sep><sep> Instead of investing in essential production, which saturates the world market with our suffering, we should invest in food production for all inhabitants of the Earth, invest in water distribution, invest in health and medical care, invest in renewable energy production. <sep><sep> Strikes, it is not a situation where everyone goes on strike, then each for themselves, then it becomes a general strike, no! <sep><sep> It must become more democratic because when the people want it to be more democratic, and during the electoral campaign, the people have a little power. <sep><sep> LALIT expresses our solidarity with the 121 workers of the Pre-School Trust Fund who receive a salary of Rs 1,000, a salary that clearly is not enough to live on. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I believe our only party that has a political program advocating for the decriminalization of abortion. <sep><sep> To take an example from Mauritius, the emancipation of slaves was against the interests and the will of the owners, against the will of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> We have noticed a repressive trend from Prime Minister Berenger when he attacks the press (he even attacks cartoonists) and private radio stations, every time they criticize him. <sep><sep> Now, we are stuck in Jame'en village and we cannot leave. <sep><sep> He gave many examples that contradict this argument: Why did the Israeli army bombard the United Nations School in Gaza, resulting in 40 deaths? <sep><sep> They were in favor of the PMSD, advised by legal advisor Gaetan Duval, President Clement Mootoo, PMSD candidate. <sep><sep> We noticed that the former MMM-MSM Government came with proposals to attack universal human rights for elderly pensions. <sep><sep> The difference between the Labour Party and LALIT, two parties with clear programs addressing the current systemic crisis. <sep><sep> Every week, Gro Derek, Bangaleea, Brother Timol... scandals are revealed. <sep><sep> The starting point is agro-industry, that is ensuring capacity to preserve and transform food products (putting them in cans, making jams, etc.). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government is trying to change the law because it finds the DPP "too independent". <sep><sep> What we are witnessing today, on one side there is the politics of class struggle represented by LALIT, which defends the interests of the working class, and on the other side there is the politics of the other parties, which defend the interests of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> It died peacefully in the night on 13-14 May, with the army at its feet, a lizard sitting on its chest. <sep><sep> through the 'metabolic rift' created by capitalist production and capitalist agriculture. <sep><sep> And it is not the AGOA derogations or the diplomatic moves that will resolve medium and long term issues, which go beyond the protocol of the Disiku feast and the Laktor Milti-Fib feast. <sep><sep> Former leaders of the CSG like Atma Shanto, as well as the leaders of the CTSP, Reaz Chuttoo and Jane Rughoo, have exposed Ashok Subron's manipulative role in the trade union movement. <sep><sep> The Ramgoolam government seems unable to conduct an analysis showing that it is not just a series of conjunctural crises that Mauritius has been going through for 6 years, but a real structural crisis questioning the production structure in Mauritius. <sep><sep> In practice, Timi became a great orator who could avoid male chauvinism in political discourse, something that many women political activists did not understand because they thought that emancipation was <sep><sep> A society where there is terrible inequality between the very rich and the very poor. <sep><sep> (iv) establish a "New Republic" or "2nd Republic" where Ramgoolam (who already has too much power) becomes President with power, and Paul Bérenger becomes Prime Minister. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A foreigner who was making an effort to adapt but couldn't understand the culture and way of life in Gondwana. <sep><sep> And, this case was supposed to be in October, meaning this month has just passed. <sep><sep> These differences will influence many by exacerbating the economic crisis in Mauritius and deepening the crisis. <sep><sep> It, he doesn't even know what damage has been done at a very concerning level! <sep><sep> So, the type of work that the Lalit de Klas activist was doing, and I believe it was work that allowed for the level of democracy that existed before and during the 79 Revolution. <sep><sep> The first thing you hear about it, you might think it means "government", maybe "Constitution" or "Parliament". <sep><sep> There was a boss who was abusing women workers. <sep><sep> Women faced many issues because they didn't know their rights, they had many difficulties raising children because the old social support network no longer exists. <sep><sep> This trend is especially represented by Cader Sayed-Hossen (who became Minister of Commerce), Nita Deerpalsing (who replaced J.Burtty David as the main spokesperson of PT). <sep><sep> All villagers know that it provides information to the Israeli army. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is also impressive about Madajazzcar, is the way they have managed to develop a Malagasy Organizing Committee that has almost total autonomy in which they invite others to come and play. <sep> And it's serious, because it means that we are selling what could make us innovate and become a more complete and unique individual. <sep> This means that this worker must leave his job post in order to be able to put another one. <sep> When MSM starts to cry that it wants to change the law, it comes from this petty-bourgeois opposition camp. <sep> and business tycoons (4 key clusters of sugar mill owners are seeking control "territorial threat" over each square meter of Mauritian land), it is not easy for them to keep their land holdings to themselves. <sep> here are the demands we think are not just reasonable but also necessary to protect life on our land and prevent us from becoming slaves of multinational corporations: <sep> Lalit to define my-duty and voting awareness after nomination day and the date of withdrawal when Lalit has studied political forces and prospective candidates. <sep> Silly barriers were preventing valid people from entering. <sep> It shows how these two revolutions are connected. <sep> Because of this, we must understand the real distance there is, between the rights that the legal system gives you, and the rights that the corrupt legal system takes away. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And okurans, they all work for a regular salary. <sep> Barack Obama promised to tax the wealthy and was elected on that basis. <sep> Here is what a major winner, Lindsey Collen, said: <sep> She shared experiences and knowledge about Diego Garcia, and the struggle against that base, with people fighting against American bases in Japan. <sep> We must defend them and also fight for new rights. <sep> An attempt to classify workers taking power in alliance with "nationalists": <sep> Mr. Pakeeree and his children, they are also victims of a patriarch because they have lost everything they loved. <sep> The employer had to justify the dismissal in front of that Board. <sep> We had a society that went astray, then we were cultivating land that was not ours in the feudal era, we are not going into details, but what is important is that there were different ways of producing things in history. <sep> And then, yet another ballot of 14 "Best Loser" (not based on communalism this time). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What characterizes the Fourth International is the work that rested on the Transitional Program that Trotsky developed. <sep><sep> The proposal to make a "smart" calculation beforehand, with the Best Loser to establish comminal representativeness, then propose a party nomination system for the names of 30 deputies, which shakes up everything in its turn! <sep><sep> So, today on a global level, we are in one of those cyclical crises. <sep><sep> I am proud that Mauritian comrades have accepted the invitation from Lalit and Sant Idriss-Goomany and that they have gathered tonight to gather their strength to accelerate this defining moment. <sep><sep> They have brought forward a politics to reduce unemployment and make concessions to establishments. <sep><sep> Concerning protests against the ERA and EIA laws, we find once again the same kind of competitive maneuverings. <sep><sep> The Municipal Council of Quatre Bornes is involved in a strange story. <sep><sep> In the last 5 years, we have found that they are like each other, even though there has not been what can be called an opposition. <sep><sep> Today, let's pray, talk, and take action for this demonstration, this rebellion! <sep><sep> Many signs are pointing to the formation of a new historical bloc at the same time as the sugar industry and other sectors of the economy are transforming: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ka Lindsey is currently passing in front of the Port Louis District Court. <sep><sep> Then we have civil societies, we have a lot in the past, in the history of Mauritius, where we have organizations that have brought benefits. <sep><sep> This Constitutional Amendment is not due to a contract between the population and the ruling regime, but rather the result of a political game between 2 political parties in an alliance, 3 weeks before the last general election at the Medpoint clinic. <sep><sep> And there, well, we need to finish like them. <sep><sep> It means that we can go in a direction where workers in different establishments can have different salaries and different conditions. <sep><sep> He, on the other hand, fired an absolutely horrible shot at 2 of our members. <sep><sep> In this way, candidates do not need to mention the community on the nomination paper, but the communal winner system continues. <sep><sep> Financial capital has taken power from capital in production since 100 years ago. <sep><sep> Similarly in Europe, the bourgeoisie needs a government that can impose, especially impose "austerity", with all its repression on the working class. <sep><sep> an electoral program is a program that is shot just before the election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They tried to live in a society where they were literally starting to create, starting, with this equality of status, where everyone called their fellow "citizen" or "citizeness." <sep><sep> This was just an example that I mention to show that we are in an interregnum, meaning a transitional period where there was an ancient culture resting on peace and working conditions that were regulated by IRA, which was totally imposed by the state or by state institutions, and what the new laws are trying to do is to move towards a collective negotiation situation and a collective agreement with many parties. <sep><sep> it shows willingness to think about an economic alternative on a large scale and not controlled by capitalism. <sep><sep> although through domination by nature there is "abundance," there is no money question. <sep><sep> However, there is a desire to develop a true peace industry, not a marine territorial monopoly. <sep><sep> However, it is not all about "public works" in the Keynesian sense, even if Sithanen (and many other economists) pretend it is the same thing that Keynes initiated to get out of the crisis of 1930. <sep><sep> When Jamouna went to hug his dad, he acted as if it were a normal thing without consequences. <sep><sep> I told him to organize a boycott of Jaffa oranges in the Port Louis market. <sep><sep> Reign's financial capital in this neoliberal era has caused contradictions that threaten historical change, globally. <sep><sep> Among them were the Weekend and Weekend Scope television shows, along with the website www.lemauricien.com. Advance newspaper, which favored Independence, represented according to its status a petit bourgeois (and petty bourgeois) Indo-Mauritian, and found solidarity in front of a Workers Party intellectual and leftist, and closed down. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The second boy who had a job thanks to the protection that his father was benefiting from, was spending all his time in the workplace or Sannmars. <sep> <sep> He was central in the debate on freedom in the workplace. <sep> <sep> In 2000, there were 12% of votes outside the 2 unions, while in 2005 it was only 8%. <sep> <sep> Most of the time, Wikileaks brought evidence on the real danger of the "Marine Protected Area": meaning the British consulted ecologists, merely as a cover-up to prevent the Chagosians and the Mauritian Government from reclaiming their nuclear base from the US. <sep> <sep> Social science has become a discipline of thought that leads or finds only that the capitalist system is good. <sep> <sep> When the bourgeoisie seeks a strong government, proportional representation runs the risk of bringing about a very weak government. <sep> <sep> But what he did not know was that there were sectors that were growing rapidly under his leadership. <sep> <sep> They verify checks, they spend money, they act in general to the advantage of workers, but particularly in the interest of bureaucracy. <sep> <sep> Minister Bunwaree has a duty to inform all teachers and parents about the Findings Hearing LPT. <sep> <sep> For 2 years, St Felix artisans have been waiting for the Blueprint. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We expose the type of society that produces these problems. <sep><sep> It's time to build politicians to overthrow this capitalist class that continues to bring poverty, globally and here. <sep><sep> Quite often their electoral program has an expiration date, meaning it expires after 5 years or before 5 years depending on whether the government stays or not. <sep><sep> Calling upon an element feels not like a political matter, it's not ideological, when it feels unable to repay its debt, unable to consume like others, it revolts. <sep><sep> In February and March 2004, that's when we became aware that Ashok Subron has developed unacceptable methods to advance his personal ambitions in the trade union movement. <sep><sep> We demand the reintegration of Sadna Teeluckdharry who was dismissed after testifying in favor of Valery Kallee; it's clearly a form of intimidation that interferes with both the internal investigation as well as the police investigation. <sep><sep> So, it becomes our political work to reactivate the class struggle, and its trade union elements as well. <sep><sep> There are moments of sweetness, of clarity; moments of prosperity, moments of hardship. <sep><sep> The capitalist reality we live in every day, reinforces this bourgeois ideology, in normal times. <sep><sep> So, when we look at their trajectory, we find that this strategy that once took on nationalism, has reinforced the bourgeoisie and eroded the militants. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The treaty prohibits the presence, assembly, testing, and use of nuclear weapons on the African continent, including Chagos. <sep> <sep> It's no coincidence that, when they were introducing the 24/7 system, they also stopped getting buses between Port Louis and Curepipe at night! <sep> <sep> For example, in 1982, LALIT had already allied 5 families in a single ward in Port Louis for municipal elections. <sep> <sep> In addition to decoding the State's nature through torture here in Mauritius, we have also, in parallel, gained a lot of knowledge on this issue as well as intrigue by the action of the biggest violator State in the world, the Zionist State. <sep> <sep> R. Ramdaursingh spoke in favor of Sithanen's budget, stating that it will bring about reform, relaunch, and revive the economy. <sep> <sep> Movement 1st May/ Bizlall - Like the Movement 1st May organization seems to no longer exist, but Bizlall occasionally acts as both Movement 1st May and sometimes as an individual. <sep> <sep> Moreover, even if the flat earth theory doesn't necessarily make sense, governments' linguistic repression is making it popular. <sep> <sep> Some are even calling on Catholic parents to boycott Oriental languages. <sep> <sep> When an economic crisis erupted in the 1900s, they called on their members to mobilize workers in Europe to resist and prepare for an international-level revolution. <sep> <sep> Just as people have been uprooted from Chagos by the British government and took land that is not theirs to create the State of Israel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the future, 35,000 small sugar planters threaten to decrease by 39% upon their return. <sep> <sep> It is a conscious distortion from the bourgeoisie to nourish a strong feeling of compassion, empathy that walks together with a passive and subordinate attitude towards the sovereign taste. <sep> <sep> Nick Leake continues his response to the fact that William Hague received First Minister Ramgoolam as the first, "I think this clearly indicates the importance that my new government attaches to our relationship. <sep> <sep> Since 2007, we have found signs of a new section of the trade union movement beginning to take up the same role. <sep> <sep> For example, how to make connections between our program and the trade union movement, the trade union bureaucracy, and neighborhood committees. <sep> <sep> On the old site that's away, there has been a passageway with a ceiling forming a half arc. <sep> <sep> If you have the patience to read these two documents, did you find something that makes you think that these two Alliances are proposing concrete solutions for the serious crisis threatening the Security Industry, Zone Francaise. <sep> <sep> Terre de Paix, ever since BEC, has been teaching Creole to children with learning difficulties and has developed a suitable educational approach, as well as promoting Creole language basics in its Health sector. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, an Agricultural Expert, the largest farms in South Africa, said it is a total waste to plant sugar cane in Mauritius, rather than planting it in more marginal land. <sep> <sep> This is the type of study that isolates a worker section as "extremely poor", making promises to benefit them, because only then can they pose their questions and genuinely believe in their true answers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Reconstruction of the economy should address this issue. <sep><sep> It is also an important part of politics, it strategically sets up economic alternatives and does not position itself aggressively against the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin was invited to the radio debate program Hardtalk on TOP FM on Tuesday. <sep><sep> LALIT handed over 4 items: leaflet A3 by Jack Bizlall, his letter directly addressed to a LALIT leader, an envelope with a union federation stamp. <sep><sep> When the capitalist system approaches its crisis, that is when it will seek to replace the socialist system. <sep><sep> Some ideas to be discussed in this seminar include "ways to show reading and writing and students learning quickly and students learning slowly in the same class". <sep><sep> However, Mauritian politics have been tumultuous in recent months, with factionalism taking root. <sep><sep> So for 3-4 years, many LALIT activists were active in the AWC. <sep><sep> In the evening, Alain also highlighted that the anti-nuclear movement cannot wait until there is a declared nuclear disaster before it acts. <sep><sep> There have been the "Arab Spring", protests and strikes in Europe, the movement of Indians in Spain, the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, student strikes in Canada. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MSM, MMM and the Re-make party are in favor of keeping the BLS quota system. <sep><sep> Their strategy hasn't brought a solution to the problems faced by workers, women, farmers, and youth. <sep><sep> After careful consideration, we find that there are three different viewpoints that deserve to be commented on. <sep><sep> Employers and the government, they want to increase communal, individualistic awareness, and blame workers for their individual problems. <sep><sep> Remember that just four years ago, the President Jugnauth-Berenger duo expressly prohibited the Sachs Commission from fully reviewing the Best Loser System. <sep><sep> This means that there is no ideology if there is no consciousness, general intentionality, and an agent acting like a tool. <sep><sep> So, they have destroyed 45,000 jobs, leading to the demise of an industry with no great future. <sep><sep> Creating jobs on a large scale - and also, creating jobs quickly is a necessity! <sep><sep> It will license what it already wants to eliminate. <sep><sep> Despite this truth, we find it ironic that it is the employers who make all decisions on what to produce and even on what workers have produced and are producing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was something that he considered important - we in LALIT also find it important - to hold a commemoration like we are doing today. <sep><sep> He wants the MMM to start representing the bourgeoisie's interests, to create a stake for the bourgeoisie, so he, the bourgeoisie, can make MMM abandon its "lalit deklas" ideology. <sep><sep> We must free Gaza and all Palestinian territories from military occupation and colonization. <sep><sep> The government, on the other hand, has raised its hand for this subsidy. <sep><sep> And it is involved in creating a "monarchy" since a Prime Minister, Navin Ramgoolam, is doing it. <sep><sep> They want to destroy this clear class concept, because they say, "We are all Mauritians." <sep><sep> We have launched a 3-4 year campaign to denounce the government that first built a highway and then abolished Village Elections and Village Councils. <sep><sep> It united workers under the slogans of courage and justice, "Class struggle is not racial struggle," and this has been the key to its success in its first 10 years of existence. <sep><sep> Nick Leake continues, "For example, the first world leader that Foreign Secretary William Hague saw at his Carlton Gardens residence was Mauritian Prime Minister Ramgoolam". <sep><sep> He wants to become an authoritarian leader, a kind of Bonaparte. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "Globalization, Food Security and War" by Dr. Vandana Shiva, pages 30-31, Educating for Workers<sep><sep> When you arrive in Spain, especially in the Luggage area, you'll find what this neoliberalism is. <sep><sep> The leadership was with Mr. Fernand Mandarin and a lawyer, Mr. Hervé Lasemillante. <sep><sep> Everywhere, families were starting to form small cooperatives to commercialize their products, organizing guardians for children, ensuring family security. <sep><sep> It has given Mauritius a greater international respectability, where human rights, and this respectability has "counted" for the aid that the State receives, for sure the financial aid linked to the "right to human rights" issue. <sep><sep> And finally, in conclusion, there is a transformation of power, and the development of a new strictly powerful power, class of workers and oppressed people, there is no longer a need for a State. <sep><sep> After the International Congress, the Youth Commission has been working hard. <sep><sep> What Is the Electoral System, and What Does This Mean "Electoral Reform"? <sep><sep> In the textile sector, a series of factories has closed and are closing. <sep><sep> They have 9 children, meaning they have 4 sisters and 4 brothers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are waiting for more news from Ragini Kistnasamy to know exactly what has happened. <sep><sep> There was much debate on the importance of cooperative in political strategy towards a new kind of society based on cooperation and solidarity. <sep><sep> However, when we encounter a problem in a sector, in a profession, we approach it in a different way. <sep><sep> There is a need for a response from all classes oppressed by this system. <sep><sep> We need to pay attention when we follow intellectual that has been laborious by the Government of the USA. <sep><sep> There are still many more actions/methods of struggle that we can imagine. <sep><sep> It prevents you from being what you could be, what you naturally are, not only does it prevent you from becoming that, but it transforms you into something that is of no real value, into a village minstrel. <sep><sep> Source: The Centre for Responsive Politics ( opensecrets.org ) published in Socialist Review No 267 –Oct. 2002. <sep><sep> It does not necessarily want to do it; unfortunately, it has to work harder, not necessarily to understand, but to work harder, damn it when it’s absent. <sep><sep> It doesn't say how much it has helped the capitalists, such as the ERCS, and how many are still there. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We also need to pay attention to the account of history (that challenges capitalism), which focuses on the class we want to represent: the working class. <sep>
<sep> This same system has created 3 levels of "faction" that prevent the thriving of democracy and freedom, powers that we need to protect not just humanity, but the entire Earth. <sep>
<sep> Yesterday, there were about 60 workers down there on strike. <sep>
<sep> Finally, since a long time ago, since I was little, I had a rebellious side. <sep>
<sep> It requires sticking to the private press and political party propaganda during the campaign. <sep>
<sep> Ram Seegobin explained that when Berenger spoke "off the cuff," Pravind Jugnauth is going to be the Prime Minister after 2 and a half years. <sep>
<sep>For more details on Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, look at the extract from her book. <sep>
<sep>In the upcoming General Election, there are 2 Alliances claiming to form the next government: on one side there's MMM-MSM-PMSD, and on the other side there's PT-PMXD-MMSM(Dulloo)-MR(Valayden)-MSD(Baichoo)-Lever/Fraternel(Michel). <sep>

<sep> This is how the Government and Sithanen are fooling us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But if the situation never changes until then, it will make us see. <sep><sep> But functionality, the objective itself, a program based on transitional demands is precisely what will go beyond this situation. <sep><sep> In their homes, the Sadous were holding a lantern to go to sleep. <sep><sep> According to the work contract, control the pump and count the work from nine to four and their time of design was at noon and one. <sep><sep> and each of us also has to put their work safe NUMEM, when we read, for example, about the crisis that is coming because of what is called the "American debt default". <sep><sep> ("14 families" called it the calpol, the era), to create a "state bourgeoisie" through the use of state power to grant investment permits, ensure protection for the industry, hold tenders, give contracts, ensure monopolies, etc. <sep><sep> The Minister of Gayan even went so far as to justify the deaths of civilians in the bombing of Afghanistan by the Americans. <sep><sep> At the same time, MMM campaigned on its platform against communalism when it allied with PSM Harish Boodhoo, supposedly to reassure a community. <sep><sep> Students who learned in their mother tongue (in this case in Spanish) until the 6th grade not only quickly catch up to the English level they had learned in English. <sep><sep> All-inflation no longer determines wage compensation, it has also increased productivity criteria to satisfy employers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he used to keep everyone in the room together, it was difficult to make him forget. <sep><sep> Phase of de-massification protests, in greater detail we will get a little more detail about an important phase, the phase of de-massification protests, the phase of uniting with Lalit and Movement for Liberation of the Family. <sep><sep> In essence: if we reflect in a linear manner, we will find ourselves in troubled waters: <sep><sep> So, these 2 laws were the instruments this Government used to force the working class to bear all the burden of economic development, even making the working class bear the burden of unemployment. <sep><sep> The historical bourgeoisie was quite firmly entrenched in economically powerful sections of families. <sep><sep> Today in Mauritius, only, like in many other countries like Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, Algeria... it is not succeeding easily. <sep><sep> It was totally absurd for the government to have the EIA establish the right to the people working in the extraction of minerals. <sep><sep> and in a way that Ashok Subron and Devianand Narrain have manipulated the union behind the leadership committee. <sep><sep> The government is going to make an increase, everything is going to fall apart. <sep><sep> Raymond Williams (2) observes that ideology has several levels of significance in Marxism. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Prime Minister has the right to oppose Parliament's decision to recall the governor when needed. <sep><sep> But, despite this, in its buried goal, it has produced a report that we find quite clear in LALIT. <sep><sep> So, obviously, members of the media will realise that, as part of our strategy to achieve our political program, it does not solely depend on participation in a general election, it certainly does not limit the effect on whether our candidates win or not. <sep><sep> The newspapers and television stations were looking to cover Timi; they were looking for interviews. <sep><sep> In a systemic crisis, where, as Oupa Lehulere and also John Percy have explained in various International Conferences of LALIT in the last 2-3 years, there is not only much suffering for the poor (which abounds), but there is also an opportunity presented for creativity in the ways that bring about lalit. <sep><sep> It's not just the Prime Minister's Ministers, but the Deputies elect them. <sep><sep> And this, according to Marx, he explicitly explains it, it creates a cashier, a deep cashier, in the human metabolism with the earth. <sep><sep> The 2005 election was polarized between 2 blocs, one side being MMM-MSM-PMSD, which was in government, and on the other side, as challengers, the bloc PTR-PMXD-MMSM-MSD-MR-FTS/Les Vertes (Social Alliance). <sep><sep> This has continued until neoliberalism has made it impossible today. <sep><sep> The trade union movement, this year, and it's terribly challenging to see, has built a separate mobilization space, and is in a public bureaucratic conflict. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He can provide his police statement at the police station, in the hospital atmosphere where everyone is whispering. <sep><sep> Love begins with true love that gives life to make life climb to heaven. <sep><sep> Because it is not questioning the capitalist economic system. <sep><sep> The other two questions since his young age were aware that they had an anti-criminal stance. <sep><sep> In 7 generations, it will come, it will destroy you. <sep><sep> The bullet that the high priest okayed this third day will give, will give grass elevations, animate elevations, walls elevations, stone walls elevations. <sep><sep> And they understand that establishments will have to deal with soil mortars, IRS, hotels. <sep><sep> 6. What measures the Government should introduce, and where necessary subsidize, to plant which produce food products and to raise, such as: a. <sep><sep> Not at all, they prefer to maintain their position to continue cultural dominance over a people. <sep><sep> Many people become aware of the situation in England, particularly in America, they become aware of the injustices that the British government has committed against the Chagossians. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> (Reminder in Zizman of the pleasure of taking our political mansion as part of the LAPITA campaign to sit on FLOTILLA LAPE to go to Diego Garcia.) <sep><sep> (This island can be a great unity like the current establishment and also many tiny units working together as a true cooperative). <sep><sep> Minister Mohammed has succeeded in stopping all trade union movement by calling for the revocation of these 2 laws and rejecting the amendment to these 2 laws. <sep><sep> So, LALIT, even though we are electorally weak, we have political strength. <sep><sep> If we look a little further and forget Sithanen for a moment, we see that the State guarantees a national march. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen has witnessed the crisis with the recession that is now worsening. <sep><sep> What he is saying to you is, "Now there is a Marine Park, which means that there will be no economic development on these other islands, except Diego Garcia". <sep><sep> It shows that even in the military bazaar it’s moving - even though we can’t forget that there is a military occupation. <sep><sep> Regarding the press, it is an institution that is in crisis today, they have a very specific role in different blocs. <sep><sep> We also find ways in which these dynamics create conditions for a broader political unity towards socialism, strengthening mobilization based on demands. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, it was a little bit his voice that made Jean-Claude angry. <sep><sep> But, what we can say is, it is the Second Republic, in a downturn like the one we are living in today, it does not bring any positive results for work. <sep><sep> Lalit had 2 guests from abroad, one from South Africa and one from Reunion. <sep><sep> They focused on the rights of return and reparations. <sep><sep> And this led to a reaction from the British government to provide means of transport for Chagossians to visit the Chagos. <sep><sep> In April 2006, as the MSM had a majority opposition deputies, Nando Bodha replaced Berenger as the opposition leader. <sep><sep> If a family finds life becoming very difficult, it looks for individual solutions, it uses many words to have good education for our children. <sep><sep> a regional meeting on this issue, it is the Project for Alternative Education in South Africa (PRAESA). <sep><sep> It is impossible to speak; One can take it from morning until now, make it a matter of question. <sep><sep> This is rather a racist matter (which was not new, but has become more acute). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When there is a conflict of interest between workers and employers, what should a responsible government do to mediate? <sep><sep> During a food crisis, like MMM and MSM, it emphasizes that food production is not only in Mauritius, but also in Madagascar and Mozambique. <sep><sep> All of this gives an idea of why LALIT says that we need to strengthen our party, which is not just in the same political arena, but in the same stubbornness of constantly creating more serious divisions. <sep><sep> At the same time, they have neglected the development of the renewable energy sector, they have reduced agricultural diversification, they have underestimated the importance of basic food production for local consumption and for export. <sep><sep> So, are we really going to fight for food security in this way in this country? <sep><sep> When we say big sector, what do we mean? <sep><sep> We are saying that the law should not have been included. <sep><sep> for creativity, for everything that brings general development to a child. <sep><sep> It is up to the majority to choose the people they want to represent them. <sep><sep> A part must also be able to say that we are NOT doing it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When a strong leader talks only in a colonial language, it is a vestige of colonial racism, a leader with no scientific foundation. <sep><sep> They have information; that means they go under the shop to talk with people, or they pay information, they get information. <sep><sep> We are looking to include the "excluded", make them "included". <sep><sep> Too many people say "claim and demand are the same thing". We differentiate between claim and demand. You can claim a wage increase, for example. But with a wage increase, what you can get, the capitalist system does not make it happen. <sep><sep> Timi really enjoyed talking to them and after the meeting he went to invite them for a drink where he lived. <sep><sep> This means that a person in a social class must be aware that he belongs to that social class. <sep><sep> They have started their Integrated Resorts Scheme system to convert agricultural land into luxury camps for millionaires from abroad. <sep><sep> It's an exciting time when we are accelerating our actions and improving our coordination. <sep><sep> Because every whenever they produce they are losing more than Rs 2,000 in the goods. <sep><sep> There are many more criminals today than ever before in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This program follows a series of other programs in the new Lalit program series: Laliberte, Workers' Rights, Language, Family Liberation, Ecology and Alternative Economy. <sep><sep> If you organize a well-equipped clinic, it is more favorable for the working class, for example, to go to a doctor who sees private clients for a private consultation. <sep><sep> There was a well-organized mobilization by the unions that took place in a protest in front of Telecom Towers on the 13th of September. <sep><sep> So, it is saying that it is necessary to integrate the best losers in the party list. <sep><sep> Roland Fozoo said today that he hopes that this case will be submitted to a campaign to make the police, the police institutions and the state itself "accountable" for their actions. <sep><sep> He prefers the others to see him as a miserable bourgeois, because he has bought a Hillman Hunter. <sep><sep> That, all women, in Mauritius, since Independence, before that, have experienced this reality. <sep><sep> The people who were happy with the show were happy to witness the execution. <sep><sep> Together, all of them in the Historic Block, they will celebrate a big party at Ama Touke House in Lesid, where the big bourgeoisie and leaders of the Workers' party, unionists, will swear to support their comrades' initiatives - yesterday's disagreements, and now sugar, progress. <sep><sep> Instead of wasting time dreaming, intelligent people like Devi had to do their best to show that women can do better than men. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will also be an important point in the work that we will have to do today during our Theoretical Seminar. <sep><sep> However, they used to know, they used to know this bed that has been a pleasure for years on the issue of recognition. <sep><sep> How we will organize our political activities, especially as an organization, and at the same time keep an eye on recruiting new members, strengthening our branches, making our political activities fun. <sep><sep> It has been noted that in 1959, before the Cuban revolution, 80% of people could not read/write and now almost everyone can read/write. <sep><sep> And when he was showing his scars, he used to say, "Boss Kase" (we don't know what that means). <sep><sep> He wasn't even mentioned in his preambles and Mauritius played a central role in the drafting of the Pelindaba Treaty. <sep><sep> They have 8 children, meaning they have 4 sisters, 3 brothers. <sep><sep> Among the 9 parties that split to form 2 blocks where on one side PTR represents the locomotive and on the other side, MMM represents the locomotive. <sep><sep> Furthermore, he has also shared his experience with the Labour Party since the 60s. <sep><sep> We have conducted many "campaign meetings", distributed several leaflets to popularize our 4 demands, distributed 4-5 leaflets per 10,000 people, organized 150-year village/district meetings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, it is becoming an economic war between a dominant power and a rival power in the capitalist class of America and Europe. <sep><sep> In 1995, the army demolished their homes either because their homes were too close to the land that the army had earmarked for acquiring a strategic location. <sep><sep> Content track that LALIT has been distributing since Friday 23 April 2010. <sep><sep> When he was in MMM, at the beginning in the early 1976s, he was a “worker” in MMM, and he was in GWF, in the trade union lalit, against the petty bourgeoisie which was in the direction of MMM. <sep><sep> On the tenth year of their marriage they had become brother and sister. <sep><sep> With the resignation of Siddick Chady, we need to go for a partial election. <sep><sep> One morning, on the thirtieth anniversary of his birth, Sanndia told Yosi, "Love has sown a seed in my belly." Yosi had just finished his shower, turned around, and kissed Sanndia on the forehead. <sep><sep> There was also a problem in Kifr Hares yesterday evening, so we are on standby to go if we need to help. <sep><sep> and waste water, MTPA, DBM, Albion Fisheries Research Centre, Air Mauritius, Port Louis Water Front, Belle Mare Tourist Village, Lake Point, Citadelle Management, Cargo Handling Corporation, Casino, Domaine Les Pailles, new Airport. <sep><sep> We had scandals in Med-point, Boskalis, Betamax, Bangaleea, Gooljhaury/Soornack, Bois de Rose, and the Timol Brothers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This latest Israeli military intervention in the name of political interventionism is ready to use any means, even armed force, to prevent and block all forms of solidarity and support for the Palestinian people. <sep><sep> However, what has happened since Mauritius has suffered a social scourge of drugs, and then later of violence, is that this is the time when attacks on these problems have been made in their entirety in their society. <sep><sep> The system of "employees" was introduced from 1964; a facility and CEB were nationalized; labor laws and awards were instituted; <sep><sep> Just like in Latvia and Lithuania, when there is a dictator maintaining national unity at the level of the Soviet Union, when the nationalist dictator ("socialism in one country") goes. <sep><sep> He said where we're going: He said, the PT today is a prisoner of its pre-electoral discourse, its economic democratization, putting people first, on the other hand, economic pressure is increasing and the crisis is getting worse. <sep><sep> Many people might have felt that the election day would be safe. <sep><sep> Workers with 15 years of service may lose their job at a hotel when one day is absent. <sep><sep> The work that the Mauritian Creole Academy (AKM) has done has given all the pretexts that the government used to refuse to introduce the Creole language: there is an official orthography, there is a grammar book for teachers, and there is a curriculum. <sep><sep> So, Berenger wants to introduce a dose of Proportional Representation and keep the Best Loser, even if the number of best losers is reduced to 4,5,6. <sep><sep> What is important is not to bring an education system from another place, but to make something good for here. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This encounter will create conditions for us to develop a closer, more intimate, even more formal and rational relationship with our mother tongue. <sep> <sep> Lalit is calling all workers and young generation who are growing up, who love freedom, who oppose all forms of communal division, to oppose this anti-democratic drift in which Paul Berenger is leading our country. <sep> <sep> This session is entitled "Rights in Work". <sep> <sep> It is a program that spans different sections within us every week. <sep> <sep> On 28 October 2002, on the occasion of the Creole Language World Day, we launched a motto to say: "Our language is our humanity". <sep> <sep> Historical bourgeoisie is more like a "landed" bourgeoisie as Amedee Darga says: it waits for lands to return. <sep> <sep> So old, whether you ask how it will rule. <sep> <sep> By putting the emphasis on "descendants of slaves" instead of working class and poor people, Armance provoked amendments with a communal tone when Paul Berenger suggested a first amendment to include "language" in the debate on reparations. <sep> <sep> On 14 September, Arvin Boolell presented his Road Map, a 10-year plan. <sep> <sep> It is a speech he made in 1984, and he somewhat follows another article he wrote in November 1976 called "State and Elections". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The contribution that group A4 seems to have made is to develop musicians and promote jazz music reflecting the potential that the different musical styles of Mauritius have, it can be used when playing jazz, classical, rock or any other style of music. <sep><sep> When we arrived in Beit Leid, a resident spoke to us to ask why the cost of living and expenses are increasing. <sep><sep> In 1981 Ragini Kistnasamy and Lindsey Collen pursued the POA after participating in a protest against the Diego base. <sep><sep> We will have the opportunity to meet a woman, Edna Menes, later today during our Conference. <sep><sep> We're not looking at the classroom as a lecture hall, something abstract. <sep><sep> This is one of the factors that has made John Pilger so interested in making a documentary film about Diego. <sep><sep> In Mauritius practically everyone born here is Mauritian, there are people who have been living here long enough to get Mauritian nationality, someone who can get a Mauritian passport. <sep><sep> What is my mother doing? Why does she often scold me? People in the neighborhood have started accepting me. <sep><sep> There is really no democratic control, by Parliament, by the entire population of Mauritius. <sep><sep> The members had decorated the kiosk with palm leaves and other greenery. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a sure thing because for the first time everyone knows, no exceptions, the Creole language is entering schools. <sep> <sep> This was a true education on which the bourgeois state was banking because it showed us that where there is no state, private property is at risk of appropriation. <sep> <sep> MARON is a new political party in Reunion that was created around 3 years ago and, as its name demonstrates, it regroups militants who want to fight against capitalist oppression on working class. <sep> <sep> It was necessary to show the boys that it was stronger, smarter, and more resourceful than them. <sep> <sep> They were wearing and in Hebrew they asked to open the door. <sep> <sep> What is Workers' Education asking to stop this linguistic genocide? <sep> <sep> The celebration of LPT will end with a screening of the film "Dead Poets Society", a film that critiques the conventional schooling system. <sep> <sep> It is one of a series of 4 that the BBC has just released on DVD about the riot in a training camp in Etaples in France during the First World War at the same time as the Russian Revolution. <sep> <sep> Tourism is a vulnerable sector that can be affected by climate problems, but also by social problems like unemployment. <sep> <sep> So, this size Diego, it brings together many, many different aspects. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> On Saturday, November 8, Lindsey Collen hosted a session that focused on the impact of the financial crisis and economic crisis. On Saturday, November 15, Ram Seegobin conducted a session on the Organization of Workers' Class where participants from sectors such as the Security Industry, Textile, and ICT were present.

However, all US military bases in Japan are located on the false pretext of being a "Joint Command."

Since 1998, a local capitalist class section, especially in the textile industry, has begun a strong lobbying effort in collusion with a section of the US government to push for the adoption of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.

Second Demand: We, the people, want to massively produce food on our own land. We want to utilize the closing infrastructure, start agro-industry, export as well, start agro-industry in Rodrigues.

Media in a large measure is responsible for shaping this election campaign and giving it a complete form, defining reality in a way that masks true debate and covers it by focusing on the smokescreen of family melodrama.

An individual's husband can prevent their family from achieving freedom of movement; There was an Olivier Bancoult Conference on October 2 at 7 pm in the Ancien Hôtel de Ville, St Denis, La Réunion. We had a special "Reunion Program" session to study the water situation and plan for a second session to develop water-related demands.

At the same time, capitalists are obliged to invest in the development of food production, for local consumption and export, as it is highly beneficial. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People, nowadays, put great emphasis on education (saying that it will help fight poverty, that a certain number of people are accompanying schoolchildren, that the government offers something like a panacea). <sep>Today you will also hear that the CEB does not fall under the PRB. <sep> When some people analyze who the neo-liberal ideologists are, including the central corporations, it's a political process. <sep> The army controls every aspect and minute of your life, even while you sleep. <sep> It has been acknowledged that BIOT, Mauritius, and Seychelles were all interconnected. <sep> Only when a person reads can they reinvent this world in the book and come into communion with the writer, they will discover themselves anew. <sep>From the LALIT Paper seminar between 1979 and 2008, from various programs pulled by LALIT, from several LALIT books, from LALIT documents since its inception to today in 2008. <sep> Marx and Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, and Gramsci - all of them have come back; <sep> Rama Sithanen, specialized in this region where the government is, stated that there is a consensus, from what we gather he is trying to say that there is unity between the Ptr and the MMM. <sep> An organization spanning 30 countries has embarked on a campaign against the construction of this dam downstream, the mobilization of the villagers in Budrus has led to a significant victory: <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are describing today's situation, where the economic, social and political situation is, and where it seems to be heading. <sep><sep> Around 4:00 p.m., we received news that a riot has broken out in the village. <sep><sep> As it happens often, economic and social crises also precipitate crises in the trade union movement, especially in a period when workers depend heavily on their union to defend their rights to decent wages and working conditions. <sep><sep> In the last 2 years, a new form of paternalistic and caring approach called 'Corporate Social Responsibility' (CSR) has been introduced, where 2% of the Company's profits go towards financing a series of activities on a list approved by NGOs. <sep><sep> This week we will understand in which direction everything is going. <sep><sep> Today, the whole humanity has a history that is on the verge of extinction. <sep><sep> in Mauritius, we are particularly affected by the crisis in the Euro Zone because of our economic ties to Europe. <sep><sep> Their first reaction is naturally to stop all unprofitable flights. <sep><sep> Following the US strategy, Mauritius has begun to redefine its position, political parties, especially the MMM and some editorialists. <sep><sep> Today, with the international labor markets facing a major crash, this is starting to have a serious impact on people's lives. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the time of Marx, and even before, it has been the same until today. <sep> <sep> But, suppose a boss negotiates with SIGWA and PWU, or with a new union that he actually controls with his muscle. <sep> <sep> They say he will interfere with the development of other languages, he will create confusion in the minds of children, he will prevent them from learning English and French properly. <sep> <sep> 'A true lion.' - 'What can I do?

How can you stand it?" <sep> <sep> For example, recent programs on Alternative Economy, against Communalism, on Language, on Workers Demand Class, on Freedom, on Ecology, on Family Liberation. <sep> <sep> Its consequences will be floods, landslides, and other climatic upheavals that will bring destruction to nature, agriculture, and threaten humanity itself. <sep> <sep> Flowers against the Occupation is part of Women against the Wall and it brings together girls from 6 to 17 years old. <sep> <sep> But Timi and Balram were quite decided to have a civil marriage after a religious marriage, without letting anyone know. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Besides these two alliances, there are other communalist and extremist parties that are very dangerous and certainly not deserving of your vote. <sep><sep> So we have been getting really anti-worker laws since 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, which have seriously weakened the power of the working class. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we are fighting and mobilizing the working class to unite behind a dynamic program in its own interest. <sep><sep> We did a special issue to inform each community about our candidates. <sep><sep> This is how fundamental rights are turning into "charitable donations". <sep><sep> Similarly, the term "connecter" was invented to replace the term "collecter" for those who remain at home to support unions and associations. <sep><sep> LALIT has been following articles from both sides, as well as the "denials" that have followed, on whether Lennon is interested in Agalega for strategic and military reasons. <sep><sep> We are examining it on the site, in everyday life, how people organize and make demands. <sep><sep> Mama Jamouna would say this is "if it was normal in the course of life". <sep><sep> All of this happened in the indifference of almost all governments around the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Subscription of Port Louis Maritim and Port East must have its deputy to replace Siddick Chady. <sep><sep> It wasn't he who wrote the letter; the letter was personally written by god. <sep><sep> "In MSM, Anil Gayan is certain to embody this shiny star in harmony with America. <sep><sep> He will also be a key figure in the PT and MMM camps. <sep><sep> The concept of "nationalism" has succeeded in mobilizing the people in the struggle that exists today, I am thinking of Venezuela. <sep><sep> We are talking about regrouping individuals based on production, not based on their income, not based on the colors they wear in the morning to go to work, but based on their relationship with production. <sep><sep> We are already launching a campaign based on this Program of demands, a Program that anticipates clear demands that are essential for acting as a guide from where we are today in a society stubbornly insisting and unequal, to bring us towards a socialist society. <sep><sep> It does it by deliberately using words, and its photographic construction. <sep><sep> We have about 250,000 in the SME sector, a sector of survival of the fittest. <sep><sep> In the old European countries where there is a capitalist system, the State there takes shape from an entire history of class struggle, from all the conflicts between different classes, which ultimately form the State as it is. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Jinn Fei, Patel, IRS, Mall, please ask another question. <sep><sep> The Opposition parliament is so visionless, its only criticism of the PT-PMSD Government is these "diversionary tactics." <sep><sep> In our Theoretical Seminar, we also mentioned that the ACP and EEC Courts are disappearing. <sep><sep> Personally, I think they thought these two sectors wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure! <sep><sep> We need to be vigilant, continue to organize, and mobilize progressive forces. <sep><sep> He says it's a statistical problem; wherever the new laundry room is now, there are no traces, and only the same old footprints remain. <sep><sep> Sometimes we have also participated in the peace rally. <sep><sep> But, generally, more than 30-year-olds are invited, not just "youngsters" inviting "youngsters". <sep><sep> So, Le Sentinel is acting like a typical corporate predator in the age of globalization, like other groups such as Le Defi, Radio Plus, Hebdo, etc. <sep><sep> When Alain contacted me, he told me to comment on the six books being launched today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Attack on elderly pension and SC-HSC allowance to make them 'means tested' <sep><sep> Why is there no Department of Creole language studies in the University, MIE, MCA? <sep><sep> To employ Mauritians with a slight inclination towards a specific diploma? <sep><sep> When one says they have marked 1 or 2 symptoms, but does not want to say they are ill, just that they have symptoms. <sep><sep> This strategy to negotiate company by company is similar to what the employers in the Sugar Industry are forcing down the throats of workers and artisans. <sep><sep> Today, we can say that at least 2 years, SILU and sirtu UASI, also AGWU, are in the Historical Block. <sep><sep> He knows that a REQUEST For all people in villages, he had finished drawing on the wall. <sep><sep> Objective and Subjective Factors When we talk about "objective factors", we mean economic realities, more than state realities, geopolitical realities, political realities that are clearly beyond our control for at least a period of time. <sep><sep> and that sometimes even become harmful when they deteriorate, they spoil, they become dangerous, or have no more courage. <sep><sep> When Lindsey was talking about the strikes from '79, '80 to the year 1982, we were aware that class consciousness was strong. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So our first conclusion is that the state is not required to function for society. <sep><sep> On the last Sunday, 2 Palestinian fighters died from gunshot wounds near Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza. <sep><sep> And Correa's coalition had a large majority with 74 out of 130. <sep><sep> After he left, MMM joined forces with his two phantom partners. <sep><sep> Commemoration was held during a day of testimonies and analysis on Monday 23rd at Grand River, Port Louis. <sep><sep> and modern solutions to respond to the problems of poverty, to respond to the need for more economic development here and in the world, so that at the same time we produce what is necessary for us and the world. <sep><sep> He even reserved a small room on the right side of the Social Security, for a phantom public meeting. <sep><sep> Children participated more and with more enthusiasm in classes. <sep><sep> Ganga insisted that it was a family prayer and when he insisted, his family preferred to sit to have peace. <sep><sep> Crisis were eased by the fact that workers had brought peace, had even made a revolution, and a part of him were threatening revolution, and the boss was so scared he even sat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, if Zedi is last, the resigners are now saying they resigned because they do not agree with the methods used to stop the LALIT Zen Group, whether it be ridiculous or unfair. <sep><sep> A group met in Flacq on Saturday at 3:30 pm for a political education session by LALIT on the issue of the global financial crisis. <sep><sep> In English, we say "objectification" or "reification" is happening. <sep><sep> Since the report in 5-Plus does not seem to have much connection with what Lindsey said, we have asked her to give the same statement again for us to put on the LALIT website. <sep><sep> This has not affected the number of seats PTr/PMSD holds as Yatin Varma is not an elected member, he is a Minister appointed as the Attorney General. <sep><sep> In fact, in this PALESTINE DAY Ragini Kistnasamy recounts her daily life as a volunteer in the occupied territories of Szechuan in a village called Hares 2 months ago. <sep><sep> Firstly, I would like to express my appreciation to the LALIT Party for providing us a platform today to express our views on the theme "What do unions expect from a political party" in a fairly broad way. <sep><sep> Ashok Subron presented himself a bit like a professional IT, meaning he does this as a professional. <sep><sep> In the 1948 general elections where for the first time all literate people in any language could go and vote in Mauritius and where the number of candidates was reduced, it provoked a historical shock for the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> I do not know where the leaks are coming from, as soon as our comrades finish telling the story, there are 10,000 flyers ready to say the strike is continuing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT organized an evening on Palestine in 2009: Film + Discussion on the book "Norman Finkelstein, analysis on Israel." <sep><sep> This was only a campaign in the world against MAY and in the end, MAY did not succeed. <sep><sep> To make it easy to understand: You create a village with houses like in Mauritius, with terraces and olive trees behind people’s houses. <sep><sep> Different reasons had their own cultural reality. <sep><sep> The missile that he carried could be directed at a boat in the Indian Ocean from the Pentagon, that is, the US military department. <sep><sep> Systematically, the media boycotted LALIT, or preferred to take action against LALIT as not an action, but as a trivial matter. <sep><sep> Have you decided on a name? - "Joshua." - "If it's a girl?" - "Don't know. <sep><sep> "Tell me I'm not coming to work, a bunch of women were chasing me down." He made his Ferguson to Mr. <sep><sep> Based on the old law, if a boss has to lay off, he has to pay what is called severance pay, that is, he has a license money that he has to pay. <sep><sep> As there are different classes, in its class definition, their relations are antagonistic. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Devanand Ramjuttun, who took the floor on behalf of SILU, spoke specifically about the serious situation that workers are facing with the new VRS. <sep><sep> He learned about this movement during the "Comics for Change" event. <sep><sep> In countries like Mauritius, America, Europe, especially workers are having to cope. <sep><sep> They integrate the Labour Party, they integrate a Labour Party that was dominated by the Advance Group. Thus, we have a Labour Party leadership that is partly from the Advance Group and partly from this bourgeoisie elite, especially professionals, doctors, lawyers represented by this syllable that I have just given. <sep><sep> There is copra, as you know, chicken livers, and some people have to sleep on it. <sep><sep> Together in the union, workers discover that the work it still remains within the capitalist system, where the courage of the worker is simply treated as merchandise. <sep><sep> Language, that is our linguistic capacity, is our biological capacity to understand the world that surrounds us. <sep><sep> The number of workers who were around 50,000 by the '80s, today represent around 5,000. <sep><sep> This is what happens when the issue of the base and the issue of sovereignty are separated. <sep><sep> In these provinces where the new system began initially, in 1993, children who had a mother tongue as a medium of education achieved better results in the year-end exams, which were in English. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If we get all the facts right, then it will become possible to start understanding where the problem lies. <sep><sep> Many people believe, indeed it has been done, that this best loser system of categorical communitarian classification should disappear through the ruling of a court here, either the Privy Council or the UN General Assembly. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen presided over the Press Conference on behalf of Lalit. <sep><sep> Participants included a man from the IT sector, a woman from the University of Mauritius, and 3 young family professors and a man who is also a professor. <sep><sep> With systemic crisis, we can expect the big non-desires to increase, we can expect the work to be more in demand, and the police to be more behind women who are working. <sep><sep> To obtain CSR, the law says that an organization must exist for 2 years. <sep><sep> Three Sadhus told him that they would take care of the food. <sep><sep> It is not surprising that there are Malagasy musicians, often very young, who end up becoming exceptional jazz musicians. <sep><sep> Moreover, the MMM has even reduced to one part Beau-Bassin, Rose-Hill, Curepipe. <sep><sep> And the reasons why they are holding Palestinians at checkpoints. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - Advertisement claiming that the transformed mill closed in the licensing areas where food processing, preservation and agricultural product transformation takes place.
- In our Residential Seminar in Zeitz, we had a specific session on syndicates and on fragmentation in federations and confederations.
- Once again, it is a contradiction, because an increase in consumption is not compatible with sustainable development.
- MMM's Paul Bérenger for more than 30 years has been promoting "proportional representation" (PR). Nevertheless, Bérenger maintained his stance that he will not accept the Basic Living Salary.
- He embarked on privatizing pension funds and pension funds, allowing the price of rice to increase due to the depreciation of the rupee.
- and accusing the Israeli government of reinforcing Israel to impose blockades on Gaza.
- He explains how the same scenario applies in the French Zone.
- The Lalit newspaper of 21 August 1981, where Lalit provided legal documents to show that the nuclear equipment had transited there to reach Diego Garcia.
- But he decided to get married outside his village because in Hamlet everyone was like family or almost family. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the government and the 2 main parties have succeeded in reducing a partial election to a "nephew-niece" situation, where the workers support the nephew, MMM the niece. <sep><sep> Tell me if the social force is strong, you should rather if the forces/interests social and political capitalists are strong, it will serve the forces, it will violate the laws that it is accustomed to make its democracy flourish. <sep><sep> So, we have, as a socialist revolutionary party, to discuss with the trade union movement as a working-class organization. <sep><sep> Since childhood he said he would become a teacher but he was not very happy to make an effort. <sep><sep> MMM is not worth looking for ways to succeed or not if all prisoners become eligible to be released and re-elected. <sep><sep> In the union movement, if you do not question the logic of the capitalist system, you will be crushed, you will be defeated. <sep><sep> In the face of this, LALIT, which has existed as a political party since 1982 and also Lalit de Klas as a trend in MMM since 1976, has become a class-defying. <sep><sep> She divorced because her husband was violent and beating her a lot. <sep><sep> Funny! That dirty one was never human with that woman. <sep><sep> In its wings, LALIT has been using language for 34 years on the truth to solidify the base, for recession and reparation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You can also find higher levels of literacy, this leaves a mark. <sep><sep> This growing crisis is exposing the systemic crisis that Mauritius was already facing, and which LALIT had already identified. <sep><sep> Additionally, the police, CCID. On institutions like ICAC and ESC, we have found a loss in their credibility. <sep><sep> LALIT, on the other hand, in particular, LALIT engages in this reflection and intellectual production, LALIT carries out its political action in its entirety, in the maternal language – be it in politics, that is, on all fronts. <sep><sep> If you want to join a team, let it be known through Brans (if you are in LALIT) or let a LALIT member know (if you are not a member, but you would be happy to help for such an event). <sep><sep> The world of music, literature and theatre did not undergo a true revolution. <sep><sep> Otherwise, we must make it a priority to create enough agricultural land for food plantations to feed everyone in the country. <sep><sep> We have decided to hold a press conference to publicly announce what we are doing with this "State-of-the-Art" and this has allowed for a larger participation than anticipated. <sep><sep> In small towns, rural villages, people's homes, and under trees. <sep><sep> This family has to live without knowing where M.A. is. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is important here is that in its manifesto, Advance Group specified that the newspaper Advance which is part of this group will have to focus on controlling the Indo-Mauritian community. <sep><sep> And there's another thing that makes one believe that "Palestine was a land without a people". To understand fully these things, one can start by looking at how modern bourgeois democracy defines a country. <sep><sep> We have just been through a food crisis, where in many countries in Africa and Asia there were demonstrations against hunger. <sep><sep> And now that Mauritius has contested lawyers that the British have appointed in this affair, it may take a long time before that court resumes its work. <sep><sep> The army, the police, Border Police, and secret services say they don't know where he is. <sep><sep> 11. We are not the first to denounce the total lack of democracy in this WANTED group. <sep><sep> It starts by saying that each class society functions along 3 ideological levels: <sep><sep> CT Power is one of the examples where it uses international capital to challenge the historical bourgeois monopoly on electricity production. <sep><sep> A sentence that Sir Ralph made Ganga understand who the true boss was. <sep><sep> However, this analysis of reality depends on the understanding of all kinds of issues. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a moment when they strategically can constitute a base in the Indian Ocean (Diego Garcia location), and just visited the main gate which is close to the olive trees. <sep><sep> What relationship by people has been established with what we call knowledge, what we call acquaintances, interior schools? <sep><sep> The Alliance Social Government had to start considering this location. <sep><sep> The article does not give any indication of the questions that have been asked, or what answers have been given. <sep><sep> About 300 workers in the Palmir section have not come. <sep><sep> So, in punishment where the Government no longer considers a monthly wage compensation in the same formula, a contentious issue, may bring enough "permanent" relief to the union movement. <sep><sep> Today, the Government admits that this policy is a mistake. <sep><sep> There are also those 'little progress' that the Mauritius government has made on an ecological and energy plan like installing solar water heaters and campaigns to replace ordinary bulbs that are more used by energy-saving bulbs, and a few pilot projects like the Rodrigues wind turbine, 2 in Tref and 2 in Grenade <sep><sep> Alternative sectors, alternative production where there is a heavy presence, where there is security in presence, where there are many better prospects. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Later today we will have a poem for Yannick to read, and on Tuesday and Thursday, we will have Ashish Beesoondial and Stephanie Theodore, who will discuss a few pages from the novel "Mutiny." <sep><sep> We were really one of the 5 global organizations that helped initiate the International Conference NO BASES in Quito, Ecuador, along with Walden Bello, American Friends Peace Service. <sep><sep> Not only on environmental issues, but also on discussing economic system issues, and proposing reforms aimed at progress. <sep><sep> Therefore, the price may rise, bringing crises, as is happening. <sep><sep> Favorably, the principle "pater est" meaning "the father" of a child, also in marriage, as long as he is still married. <sep><sep> Since then, there have been certain sanctions: Jean-Claude de L'Estrac publicly announced that he was leaving L'Express and shortly after, La Sentinelle lost its Court case. <sep><sep> To prosecute the past 10 years with the PSA and POTA laws. <sep><sep> Many debates on the political importance can be drawn parallels with the fight against apartheid and the anti-apartheid struggle and the opposition to bantustans or reservations in South Africa. <sep><sep> If they find an eight-year-old girl with a napkin, carrying a pot to her mouth to sip, they put her in a special case. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Charles Darwin is discovering that changing species is changing with time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> Muvman Liberasyon Fam writes to you in context of the 2006-07 budget. <sep><sep> only two blocks left until Tuesday Wednesday. <sep><sep> refined sugar, ethanol distillation and also for electricity production. <sep><sep> If a politician doesn't march with them, they destroy him. <sep><sep> (He hasn't raised the Best Loser question.) However, being so firm with the Supreme Court, they are resetting your Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> All independent organizations since management: take control of the situation, do not use religious pretexts to gain support because it can divide you. <sep><sep> We will meet in a strict manner like the Family Commission, leisure family branches, and we have a link with the family movement, all representing a way to articulate the demands that address the current problems. <sep><sep> Overall, for the first time, Navin Ramgoolam mentioned, although it was during his Press Conference notice on Saturday, October 27th. <sep><sep> Then there's a worker who says, "This, I believe we need to get rid of this system, completely." <sep><sep> Because I say this because the IMF and the World Bank are proposing neoliberal policies in Mauritius, as they have done in parts of the world, and in Mauritius specifically. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This week we have been warned about France's degradation by the Standard and Poor's rating agency. <sep>
<sep> The population is protesting against the killings in Syria, the welcoming of invaders in other countries, the arrogant foreign policy, the spying on their own people on Facebook and through wiretapping on phones. <sep>

<sep> Meanwhile, there is a great upheaval in the two major political parties. <sep>
<sep> Progress has been made in promoting the mother tongue thanks to campaigns by Lalit and other movements like Education for Workers that have been ongoing for a long time. <sep>
<sep> Each time the children went on vacation to Timi's house, they were so spoiled that their parents had difficulty disciplining them when they returned home. <sep>
<sep> We all want to have a higher level of education - something parents would want for their children is a World Class Quality Education, as Minister Gokhool calls it? <sep>
<sep> Despite the 60-0 defeat in '82, MMM still kept that communal system. <sep>

<sep> Private sector employers will receive more subsidies if they hire interns among students who quit school (Rs 4,000) or university (Rs 7,500). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The whole list of things we agreed to do, we ended up doing them. <sep><sep> Until to arrive one day, some hotel owners could say that they are shutting down. <sep><sep> Since the beginning of 2012, the mobilization of the GWF was convened for a Tuesday on March 10. <sep><sep> However, it was prettier than Ramba, sexier, more alert, more adventurous but it was always looking at everything that happens in front of its eyes with a gaze that often made its parents laugh. <sep><sep> He started the "factory area" to help plant his windmills. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, Lalit is proud that we have contributed, even modestly, in the fight against capitalist globalization. <sep><sep> If you focus on this point, you won't get far. <sep><sep> However, when his article came out, it didn't mention the above. <sep><sep> And Workers, as we know, don't have the quantity of deputies to be able to do anything at all. <sep><sep> There is naturally a balance that becomes bureaucratic, rigid, and not necessarily helpful for the advancement of the Creole language. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is said that the sharing of places between 50% reservation for religious and accounting studies and Oriental languages for the CPE is perpetuating this infernal conflict in education today. <sep><sep> In Unit 79, the laborers and sugarcane workers have gone on strike to prevent the closure of the sugar factory and to assert themselves against the 2 unions. <sep><sep> Lalit is the first political organization to campaign on this issue in Mauritius. <sep><sep> When R. Seegobin and L. Collen were subjected to their presence, they refused to leave their seats and even their names. <sep><sep> and the death of another woman due to illegal work, we have asked the government authorities to take our position into account: <sep><sep> MEF President says there will be "downsizing" of companies due to the crisis in Europe. <sep><sep> Today we are in a Lalit campaign to reinforce the base of Diego, for the reunification of the Republic of Mauritius and for more reparations for the Chagossians, three goals that are closely linked: <sep><sep> On a national level, but also on a global level - with one exception as in Latin America. <sep><sep> After this session, Ram Seegobin answered questions and there was debate. <sep><sep> However, this provision posed a problem: after the first year, when many workers had completed their first strike, there would be significant division among workers in all sectors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means the existence of different social classes, the problem of who controls resources, who controls power and decision-making, control over the land, over the sea. <sep><sep> In 1995, the book between us gave ourselves sovereignty to start what would have been a single "conference", which has become the All Workers Conference, a series of 17 conferences. <sep><sep> With the emission of carbon dioxide, we are affecting the planet and, in turn, the disastrous consequences for the world. <sep><sep> Present in the press conference were Sitressen Murday, Andre Pierre, Cindy Clelie, Lindsey Collen, Alain Ah-Vee, Rajni Lallah, and Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> It analyzed where we stand today in terms of our mother tongue? <sep><sep> Just like this election, they say, they decide: who will govern. <sep><sep> It replaced the "ranking" system with "grading" and introduced a zoning system. <sep><sep> It is not enough to bring about union cooperation, especially a union cooperation that is increasingly coming to terms with employers, with the State. <sep><sep> Another important point is that there were many interactions with other organizations: Education for Workers, Family Liberation Movement, Bambous Health Project during its 25 years of existence, Playgroup. <sep><sep> TRIPS has also been implemented by government law to allow the production of GMOs, meaning patents on life, patents on nature. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was also said that voting for Lalit is a way not to waste your vote on one of those "blocks" when we know that after the election, there may be an MMM-PT coalition, anyway. <sep><sep> Anerood Jugnauth was the leader of the MMM, which has been destroyed, and he merged with Harish Boodhoo from the PSM. <sep><sep> They come with a range of solutions, a range of remedies, they come with all sorts of exaggerated measures. <sep><sep> I will accept doing what I know I can do. <sep><sep> Then we asked the question whether with this twist, whether it's always possible to be a member of the MMM's inner tendency. <sep><sep> In the Catholic religion, like Jesus died on Friday, on Monday he rises. <sep><sep> Furthermore, the demands on which we have been campaigning are making progress. <sep><sep> Among the 6 families that RIOT managed to catch, then 2 RIOT took us, balance us in the air, put us in jail like sacrificial bulls, heads down. <sep><sep> In addition to pulling a child into one group, perhaps he is in another linguistic group, or is also undergoing all the principles of inflicting serious mental harm on children. <sep><sep> In the public sector, the union has reduced its workload for PRB every 3, 4, 5 months. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> IYC is a space where all the young people of the world are gathering to fight for free education, free healthcare, against xenophobia and racism, and also to denounce the xenophobia perpetuated against the African people. <sep><sep> After 40 years, we need to acknowledge that it's not easy. <sep><sep> Bomatom Bharat (formerly known as Bandoukland) was invading its neighbors and through an alliance with other rulers, the catastrophe of midday and evening tyrants that were destroying human dignity without mercy. <sep><sep> Vegetable market goods are being sold and advertised on the vegetable radio market that has its own price. <sep><sep> For production, we can imagine it as a country ruled by department heads, political appointees, such as CEB or even CWA, and to the worst, it is ruled as DWC! <sep><sep> He is also an English literature student at university, a writer and poet and has written a book "Blazons of Contrast" together with his friend Reaz Bukhut. <sep><sep> But, I must say, he made 3,000 people go out on the streets. <sep><sep> Because if that big machine doesn't move, it might break your house. <sep><sep> While, since the beginning of time, the Europeans have been clearly stating that between the last year and 2009 there will be a reduction of 36%, and after that no guaranteed price. <sep><sep> It is not easy to define itself as either pronouncing French very well or not at all. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So for us in the LALIT, internationalism does not simply mean occasionally showing solidarity towards oppressed classes in another country, but rather today, we consider making it a priority in our political work here. <sep><sep> Countries like Thailand, Laos, and India have already stated that they will not export anymore. <sep><sep> Given that there is already enough food production for everyone to eat comfortably, and that the issues of hunger and famine in the world are more political distribution issues, <sep><sep> Women in villages were bent under their burden, carrying their beautiful burdens, but their flowing milk streamed towards destiny Shakti Devi. <sep><sep> When there is a shortage of food, as we are beginning to experience now, all Governments of the producing countries immediately block their exports. <sep><sep> Even the press has noticed this Subron's play, which suddenly stopped its conversation with the Minister, or maybe started it with Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> In these moments of action, if they are spontaneous and without the conscious participation of those involved, they often provoke repression, but if they form part of a strategy that is emerging consciously among that group. <sep><sep> This was well before the Assembly, well before the suspension of the Youth Group. <sep><sep> More and more crises are presenting themselves with a greater intensity, a larger scale. <sep><sep> It is in this context that we need to look at the AGOA Business Forum and the announced visit of George W. Bush to Mauritius in January 2003. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Rajni Lallah 2008, participated in the Conference on Economic Crisis, organized by an organization called "Dialectical Materialism" in London. <sep><sep> The dominant class, at the same time, is very strong because it is everywhere, it is because, in order to exist, it needs to be total, it is very easy to crush the dominant class. <sep><sep> We do not find any connection between these benefits and the political program that the Labour Party is implementing. <sep><sep> But this profit for the capitalists is coming out of the pockets of the people who are paying for this profit increase through inflation. <sep><sep> At the same time, what is remarkable, what all signals, public space, in the popular neighborhoods, quite right. <sep><sep> This means that it is not automatic that we will field a candidate. <sep><sep> In the 40th week, a committee will be set up to negotiate the modalities of the 40th week. <sep><sep> because the working class is the majority in the country, so that finally they can enter Parliament. <sep><sep> In this way, as a minority, old-age pensions for more of a universal right. <sep><sep> In the 1960s, 1970s, the 4th International had links with organizations and revolutionary movements in many countries, especially in Latin America and Asia. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>When we will get a new advancement in the work class, it must be conscious of the experience that we have lived. <sep><sep>Without being pessimistic, we are expecting more difficulties later, we are clearly in a very serious situation. <sep><sep> It was sweet, but they, they went to another organization. <sep><sep> People were happy with the little work they had done, their small house, small car, wife, children. <sep><sep>WSF is a space for reflection, democratic debate, sharing experiences. <sep><sep>Where we can give a hand, a helping hand, so that the fight they are already waging, it finally arrives to free people. <sep><sep>and Government diversifies the economy from cane to other food products, from sugar to other agro-food products, so that workers have jobs in the future. <sep><sep> His death in solitary confinement precipitated three days of rebellion in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Employment Rights Act (EriA) and Employment Relations Act (EreA), which the Ramgoolam government voted in 2008, have a fundamental principle: to amend the law to allow employers to dismiss workers when they want and to allow employers to make workers work longer hours for less pay. <sep><sep> This balance sheet, which we are reproducing from our notes, formed part of our Assembly Member Sunday before we celebrate Christmas. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government must ratify and implement all international conventions on Health & Safety. <sep><sep> Comrade Kisna: I was reflecting on the issue of class struggle and class consciousness. <sep><sep> Even though he is doing good, he does not recognize it. <sep><sep> What is important is understanding the program, the collective understanding that we are trying to create together, and when to demand what will move us forward. <sep><sep> In a pedagogical perspective, materials serve as support for literacy. <sep><sep> Many graduates from establishments either found work in establishments or in government. <sep><sep> It is said that the way society generally survives is through material means, the way it is disturbed by material means, the way, in reality, society thrives on everything that is necessary (and also unnecessary) for society's life. <sep><sep> Unemployment continues to rise and has exceeded 8%, with 25% being youth. <sep><sep> The MRA has not managed to unify the former governmental departments (income tax, VAT, customs, etc) into a harmonious Authority. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, other political factions, during the same period, have continued to deny the existence of a systemic crisis. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Israeli army killed several civilian volunteers who participated in this action. <sep> <sep> Indeed, our opponents' intelligence believes that pro-BLS and/or common classification maintenance has been severely impacted. <sep> <sep> It is much better to ensure the advancement of our political program, which aims to redistribute land, ensure freedom, ensure food and justice for all, ensure family rights, ensure a fairer legal system, fight for class equality, and thus create a classless society. <sep> <sep> When it comes to our political ambitions, we will face a crisis head on. <sep> <sep> There are many studies on food and nutrition plantations that are taking place in many Ministries. <sep> <sep> This year, for the first time in international sports history, the Olympic Games will take place in Lasinn. <sep> <sep> They were allocated funds from the Treasury, Land from the Bay, creating jobs at the cost of destroying others, stopping the devaluation caused. <sep> <sep> But with the invitation immigration social center, new markets; laying the foundation stone for the first building, schools, public toilets; hosting night congresses, women's congresses... <sep> <sep> And we demand the Equal Opportunities Act where most public employers on the internet have applied for job positions and their qualifications, and some have gained employment. <sep> <sep> The working class should not be ashamed, in fact, to support a socialist program, namely the one we propose. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in our new agricultural program, we need to include questions on how to bring more democracy into work, how to have democratic control, and free circulation of knowledge in agriculture. <sep> For example, in 2010, in our "5-year assessment and LALIT PROGRAM" we said: "Police must be free to unionize." <sep> Systemic crises expose this kind of contradiction without any pity. <sep> Here, it's not just economic corruption, it's political corruption, political rot is spreading. <sep> His family, his work, his responsibility took all his time. <sep> But they are hiding it in a corner. <sep> Ombudsperson for Children, you get a teacher who goes to school looking for books, bringing academics, one after the other, teachers, parents. <sep> We are not just reflecting on the nature of the crisis, we are not just looking behind these scandals, and internal battles between parties, and within parties like PT. <sep> There were even clauses that give investors the right to sue the government for damages if the investor declares that his rights have been violated, for example if there is a strike. <sep> 30 years of LALIT (together with LPT and MLF) documentation that is becoming digital in the process. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - Hey there! Where are you going? - We have to wait for the sun to rise. <sep><sep> I hear that in Mon Loisir there are some weaknesses, we need to make a decision to send a reinforcement team to take care of Mon Loisir, as Mon Loisir is a bit vulnerable. <sep><sep> Participation in a U organization will notice many active members of LALIT at trade union level, environmental organization level, women's movement level, and in all kinds of different organization workers. <sep><sep> - to ensure the rights of return and full reparations for all Chagossians. <sep><sep> Self-Meter-Choula and his army of water managed to escape the ambush very well since if they were asked to kill their own mothers, they would do it without hesitation and then, suicide. <sep><sep> [Jean Yann, an environmentalist who was present for a political education session, expressed that this impression is true, and he gave an example of an article he read on the internet that says exactly that.] <sep><sep> Arundhati Roy has described the United States as a state of militarism and with an economic totalitarian policy. <sep><sep> Their army volunteers and many more were violent. <sep><sep> Rights and freedoms have decreased significantly in the last 30 years but they are still there, to some extent. <sep><sep> They all left along with all the other cities, marched in Madrid, and now, they are all walking to Brussels. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Rajni Lallah: The title of our book is the program of Alternative Economic Policy: Agriculture, Agro-Industry and Electricity- ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC POLICY. <sep><sep> In 2014, the year when the British must inform the Americans if there are any sanctions on their "rights" to use Diego Garcia for their military base. <sep><sep> The government should truly invest, and it invests through the private sector. <sep><sep> To respond to comrade Anand, is there only one government for the entire world? <sep><sep> Therefore, this crisis is becoming a 'chronicle of a foretold crisis'. <sep><sep> Prices have increased by 5 times and unemployment has increased by 8 times. <sep><sep> They do not trust themselves, or rather they did not need to seat themselves amidst this bureaucracy. <sep><sep> This is linked with our capacity to read and write, with information that is abstract. <sep><sep> It is the State that encourages us not to fall back into the barbarism that reigned when we fell into the "abyss". <sep><sep> This is how there will be a connection between political power and trade union power, not through manipulation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then he waited a week, he came and told him directly. <sep><sep> He was appointed in 1982-83 for 9 months, 1991-1994 (with MSM), 1995-1997 with PT, and 2000-2005 (with MSM). <sep><sep> The programs we have, the strategies we have put together in the last 2 years, we have been able to succeed. <sep><sep> Its importance for the country, and for the State (where it has created jobs, provided revenue from taxes, and brought in foreign currencies). <sep><sep> So we manage to work with various organizations, including MLF, LPT, and other pro organizations. <sep><sep> On HUMAN RIGHTS DAY, on December 10, Mme Veronique Topize, widow of Kaya, gave a statement against 3 police officers who were on duty when her husband was found dead in the cell of the police station, Alcatraz, on February 21, 1999. <sep><sep> I went to the market in the village to buy vegetables. <sep><sep> For the first time in Mauritius, several organizations have come together to adopt a <sep><sep> They were feeling a spiritual atmosphere and were dancing. <sep><sep> People who are talking about the bridge are asking him for his identity card. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite the permanent presence of the Supreme Court in our favor, several foreign invitees who had come for parallel activities were stopped and questioned heavily at the airport. <sep><sep> Many members of LALIT sat down and assumed a sitting position on the lawns of the airport worksite. <sep><sep> When he arrived just now, he said it's not worth bothering about. <sep><sep> We find working class the only class that has interest, capacity, and necessity to challenge the capitalist system successfully because the capitalist system depends on the exploitation of the working class to function. <sep><sep> And, because it's such a small class, it must ally with other classes to achieve its aims. <sep><sep> He believes that if women organize as women, their contribution to the struggle against poverty, against occupation, against colonialism will be greater. <sep><sep> He also explained the increase in unemployment that comes with the privatization process the government is implementing. <sep><sep> (Mother tongue as a sub-level language, plus another language, which, if the mother tongue is a sub-level language, can become a sub-level language, it also, that is to say CALP level). <sep><sep> 'I want peace, an end to the Israeli military occupation, freedom for women in a free Palestine.' <sep><sep> Your banners, when you look at them, when you get a bit of a shock, you may believe there is a new retrogressive movement, seeking to return Mauritius to becoming a French colony, but it's just a facade! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MMM has not been able to provide a credible position facing the crisis. <sep><sep> It has spoken about the systemic crisis that the economy is going through and has said that this forum will be a place after the government works superficially, just to veil the fact that Lalit is deeply challenging. <sep><sep> Therefore, it depends on the organization, mobilization, unification, and class consciousness that exist in the working class. <sep><sep> Now, after a year of work, members of AKM have helped to prepare necessary tools for the continuous advancement of Creole language, beginning to use it in other institutions such as the National Assembly, in ministries, for association minutes. <sep><sep> You may recall that Britain decreed its Marine Park in April 2010. <sep><sep> This is the first step towards privatization, and it is exactly how Mauritius Telecom was transformed and then sold 40% to France Telecom. <sep><sep> More and more of our politicians lose more of their modest leaders as pressure on them increases until religious and political discourse begins to merge.' - 'You are a spokesperson for Ayoun.' - 'Not for long.' - 'If all those who can resist become discouraged, what will become of our country? Fundamental <sep><sep> In Lalit's view here, there was a delegation of 4 people present at the World Social Forum in Mumbai where there were almost 100,000 people present. <sep><sep> Later there was a LALIT Communique when there was mobilization of laborers and artisans. <sep><sep> It may not look true to us, but today, the neo-liberal example assures us that this is true. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1976 and has been sitting in the parliament since then, except for the period between 1987 and 1991 when he was not elected. <sep><sep> With his 4-5 former ministers, MES, and Ombudsperson for Children., he has gone to school to look for a book, bring, academics deposit one after another, professors, parents. <sep><sep> He will also decrease unhealthy competition, since he will contain himself at a single school level, where he supervises social control from parents, teachers, and students. <sep><sep> The pedagogues who will serve, will be based on a synthesis of the experience of LPT teachers over 30 years, and on the pedagogue Paulo Freire who puts emphasis on education for emancipation. <sep><sep> We will also remember when Aneerood Jugnauth was Prime Minister, he was very close with the commercial bourgeoisie in Port Louis as well as the country's ties with Malaysia. <sep><sep> On the other hand, intellectuals have a strong belief that literature (in Creole, for example) is something they could naturally understand. <sep><sep> But, our commitment in the political struggle is based on a program, which goes against the occupation of Palestine, on the question of the liberation of Chagos, on campaigns for an alternative economic policy, this commitment is important because it is also a part of the struggle against imperialism, against international bourgeois power, as it aims to change the unequal relationship in favor of the oppressed class. <sep><sep> Like our opposition, all forms of communalism, all forms of capitalist oppression. <sep><sep> An element that has perhaps given this more weight is the fact that Mauritius is the President of SADC, and SADC has a guideline on how to reach 30% of women in Parliament by 2005. <sep><sep> Today, the Lalit party continues to build on this movement as it has stated through its program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since then, until today, work has been ongoing to replace this system by an electoral reform that is more in line with best loser, a system that has become obsolete. <sep><sep> So, if a stranger comes knocking on our door, present him, then announce the death of a comrade on the way, then we might be able to say something more formal, "This is truly a new and sad event. <sep><sep> Social Where social justice has few penalties that represent progress. <sep><sep> Seeking to break through the narrow politics of the pro-capitalist PT-PMSD-Transfiz Government that is leading the liquidation of a series of para-state structures, for the so-called "democratization of the economy" policy which actually protects certain capitalists. <sep><sep> The Liberation Movement for Family strongly opposes the two immoral laws. ERB introduced and voted in the National Assembly last night. <sep><sep> It is perverse because it can caress and hold a rod behind its back at the same time. <sep><sep> We must also consider the possibilities of development in the areas of energy that are appropriate and renewable. <sep><sep> This means, in fact, that there is a national culture for the country, which we know, which we recognize. <sep><sep> Therefore, we believe that the issue of Diego Garcia is a fundamental point at which we must continue to fight for a total demilitarization of our territory, making the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace, and giving the Chagossians the right to return. <sep><sep> And it's getting worse, it's getting more and more serious and according to the economists (the most optimistic ones) the crisis that should calm down in 2015… in 2015! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is normal for oportinis to adopt new tactics. <sep> In the 1970 election, the Awami League (described as secular, democratic, socialist) in Bengal won a big electoral victory and captured 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan. <sep> At the same time, the anti-war movement in England, in America and around the world after the invasion and occupation of Iraq by American forces, gained strength. <sep> Now, when there is a movement for salary compensation, when there is already a National Platform, which brings together trade union movements and parties like MMM, MSM, UN. <sep> To relieve his frustration, he says that he called to ask them if he could come see them on the Sunday that was coming up. <sep> Then, UPSEE invited trade union federations and other political parties. <sep> In this process, LPT mentioned that work had already begun; <sep> The new ERA has brought about a fundamental change in industrial relations, but we are still in a transition period, even though 2 years have passed. <sep> Did people only start protesting against CT Power because it came from a certain group, or was it a communal reflex when people didn't protest when it was SUDS, but only protested when it was CT Power? <sep> The process of revolutionary change seems to involve the seizure of power by a revolutionary class of the time, in 1789, the bourgeois class, which ultimately takes power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, this understanding of these levels of awareness, different levels, we feel it is important. <sep><sep> Then, this weakness in the trade union movement, what have we found? <sep><sep> Is there comfort, material possessions, gadgets produced by the bourgeoisie that we almost agree with this program? <sep><sep> He told Bandouk that he had just made their acquaintance, that he speaks with them as if they are not there, that they have received instructions from his father to take care of him. <sep><sep> All of you, whether it be traditional political parties, the opposition, the IMF, you did not want the economy to become central in the electoral campaign, but you all knew the gravity of the situation. <sep><sep> He said that Mauritius is waiting for the Commission on the Pelindaba Treaty to begin functioning to put an end to the discussions about the presence of nuclear weapons there. <sep><sep> And these files have been scattered in moments when Veena Dholah was present in the courthouse. <sep><sep> Therefore, in the last 10 days we had to shoot live ammunition in the courthouse, in the mud by trucks, we had to put hidden documents in random trucks. <sep><sep> It is creating chaos in all spheres of society, not just the economy. <sep><sep> In several occasions, there have been some important files that have been distributed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You have this problem, which is that he is taking advantage of the law for their own benefit. <sep><sep> The meeting you had with PSUVJ, it was right after the meeting of 100 youth delegates in the villages and town. <sep><sep> At the communal level, MMM, it also has a number of members actively involved in FCM activities, and in other communal struggles in P.Verte. <sep><sep> This situation is extremely unstable, this regime is dominating these people. <sep><sep> Some were saying that for a long time they would take over. <sep><sep> Everyone in these areas was inactive in supporting the initiatives of the Diego Committee and LALIT. <sep><sep> This is because the education system is part of the apparatus that perpetuates this exploitative system. <sep><sep> And this is written in black and white in AGOA, AGOA is an American law, and in it is written in black and white that it will be applied as long as these countries do nothing against American political interests. <sep><sep> So while it is still a reality, it is a source of hope. <sep><sep> Comrade Ram: I will target a goal based on what comrade Lindsey has said. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And indeed, since the birth of Lalit in the grand student movement of ’75 and in the grand Ut ’79 strikes, there has always been a strong family feeling in Lalit. <sep><sep> And as I said before, following his resignation, Ashok Subron individually contacted other members, and what he told them when he contacted them to make them resign showed that he really has a hidden agenda. <sep><sep> We have a strategy on language issues, and it worked. <sep><sep> Different forms that campaigns can take to initiate debates among workers at the grassroots level, youth, farmers, fishermen, students and the unemployed. <sep><sep> On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Education For Workers and in the context of the 'World Day of Solidarity with Victims of Torture'. <sep><sep> It was this same platform that organized demonstrations against Bush when there was an AGOA forum in January 2003. <sep><sep> "Lalit, we always maintain that we need to be in contact with Hezbollah politically. <sep><sep> Despite their campaigns of intimidation and threats, America and Israel have not succeeded in blocking the political movement towards Palestine. <sep><sep> When you ask a member this question: "What do you expect from a political party?", when you talk to LALIT about it, they react like a consumer: <sep><sep> Jenito Seedoo (MMM) mentioned that there are companies that prevent their employees from engaging in politics and that this is a problem for youth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin said that the archaic law, which, in its 5 clauses, contains ambiguity, so in criminal cases one must prove guilt. <sep><sep> In order to act wisely, you must ask God Love for forgiveness. <sep><sep> If our children do not find the future, what will remain? <sep><sep> We have also taken a new birth: the "cane industry". <sep><sep> It will help us a lot to analyze the situation in Bizerte. <sep><sep> The workers of Lasinn have exposed slave-like living conditions they are in. <sep><sep> TNT is currently building a new “Historical Block” next to the sugar industry. <sep><sep> We find this particularly in ‘Kouma li apele’, which can be used in a classroom to allow children to present themselves to their peers in a more pleasant way than if they were simply standing in front of the class and delivering information about themselves. <sep><sep> It has started by locating the phenomenon of many events of ‘LALIT’ that occur intermittently in current affairs, and this gives ‘LALIT’ a certain central importance currently. <sep><sep> Following the Stand Alone Module on "Introduction to Creole Studies (CREO 1001)" that the University of Mauritius launched at the end of last year. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, Ramgoolam has his own agenda, and he believes "The state is me." 
<sep> Inequality, injustice, exploitation leading to serious social problems and the government's response to these issues is more repression and encouraging police brutality.
<sep> More than that, there was the Ut 79 crisis.
<sep> 44 years later, at the time of our Independence, we had a defeat in this battle.
<sep> - Criminals, stop your subversion! Were you trying to start a revolution? - Believe me, Your Majesty, they were up to no good.
<sep> When the MSM-MMM launched their campaign for a by-election, they were holding elections off-schedule: to approve the policies that they had brought in the last 3 years, and also to approve the Medpoint court case between MSM and MMM.
<sep> The second important phase was when there was cooperation between LALIT and 2 other organizations, LPT and MLF.
<sep> We found that the bourgeoisie in the north, in the French-speaking area and in tourism were blocking foreign currency in order to artificially depreciate it, and later on, the Sithanen political party accelerated this, bringing about a catastrophic depreciation.
<sep> The government has heavily relied on accepting VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme), without establishing new job opportunities for the unemployed, for example, in agricultural diversification and agro-industry.
<sep> There have never been stable alliances, nor have there been repressive and anti-democratic alliances like the red-blue-white alliance. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As long as the boss still controls the leash, he still controls the bank, the boss controls all. <sep> After Marx's death, Engels continued this theoretical work for another 30 years, and it was Engels who was more in the natural sciences than Marx, and he also had a lot of influence on the interpretation of Marxism. <sep> On Monday morning, Jamouna left his parents' house to go live with his boyfriend. <sep> Violence has increased, but to a much lesser extent, between individuals, who are the most important value. <sep> Dr. White has never found any traces of Kaya's skin in it, nor examined any part of Kaya's skin under a microscope. <sep> Kamini deeply regrets that Sami had to divide his life and time between his legal family and his true love; he was always forced to face conflict, unpleasant matters. <sep> They are lying, there is a serious crisis among us. <sep> And global neo-liberalism, it too, has finally, also reached a crisis, at the same time, making everything more complex. <sep> His soldiers were even giving candy to the schoolchildren! <sep> And more importantly, in the history of Mauritius, the state has used Chagossians as a lever to gain a profit for the gentleman; this has created conditions that today, especially after Independence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Lebanon, Australia and even Afghanistan, the conflict continues. <sep><sep> Arafat Jaradat, a 30-year-old Palestinian, died in an Israeli prison on Saturday, February 23 after being interrogated by the Israeli security service, Shin Bet. <sep><sep> Municipalities can also organize for medical facilities during the night: doctors and pharmacies can be on call on a roster during the night. <sep><sep> The number of late-night surgeries has increased in all small towns. <sep><sep> When the bourgeoisie is in crisis, they look for new sectors to place their capital. However, in this crisis, there is no room for them to invest their capital. <sep><sep> The village committee is calling for a demonstration on Friday morning to march towards the Kfar Tappuah settlement. <sep><sep> He felt compelled to go see another person who was manipulating him, forcing him to do a job he didn't know where to turn to. <sep><sep> In 1987, in our Program, we published a title "For the liberation of guards and firemen: THE RIGHT TO POLICE AND FIREMEN'S SYNDICATE: The LALIT Program", where we explained our position. <sep><sep> At that time there was a craftsman in Medine, called Herve Marcelin (Kolet), who lost his job, land, and family, all at once. <sep><sep> We asked for a certain unit in all the hospitals. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With this beginning of the discussion, which started after the departure of the MSM - where each interpretation - we find that there is often partisan consideration that has dominated over political clarity. <sep><sep> Lindsey also talked about how the crisis in Mauritius forms part of a global crisis. <sep><sep> There, he knows that he is the leader. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin also explained how the latest census where people were classified themselves in an "apartheid" style in South Africa, was in 1972. <sep><sep> We are talking about this ideology, this strategy based on “Mauritianism”, it may have not only lost its time, its best, and it is dangerous, its worst. <sep><sep> We organized the flotilla action initiative - the boat fleet to go to Diego. <sep><sep> The fact that there is internationalism in the theme of the Congress demonstrates that it is essential to continue developing political ties that we have at the national and international level. <sep><sep> Don't forget to stay connected on www.lalitmauritius.org for forthcoming events!!!!! <sep><sep> A piece by John Pilger, which also reveals our message. <sep><sep> So, it's all a matter of leisure: popularizing our program in the working class and among all working class allies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government relies heavily on bank loans, loans, and investments to manage. <sep><sep> He didn't do it to do it, and he couldn't do it. <sep><sep> Berenger's "Remake" strategy and Aneerood Jugnauth were completely frozen and even entered a hibernation phase that Berenger called a "cooling off period". <sep><sep> Educational work by Playgroup, LPT, Terre de Paix, BEC, has been done in mother tongue, has been made available in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin has said that as the opposition no longer occurs in parliament, we will continue to maintain the illusion that parliamentary opposition will make a difference for the working class and the poor. <sep><sep> We meet where friends in these 3 villages. <sep><sep> But even so, on Radio Plus, there is information from sources Berenger is Zuber Joomye and Minister Showkutally Soodhun. <sep><sep> Otherwise, not only is it not enough to bring the sanctions we say we want to bring, but it risks bringing total bankruptcy. <sep><sep> But, with Ireland and Portugal already in a deficit, they too, Lerop cannot take advantage. <sep><sep> However, the difficulty, as we have found, is that the new strict power that has formed the working class is still fragile compared to the established capitalist system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, the delegates of LALIT have also learned enough about the current situation in Indonesia since their delegate, Ariane Zely. <sep> During this decade, there were severe sanctions in Bandoudkland. <sep> And also, for the purpose of stopping the illegal transfer of prisoners from the Occupied Territories to the Israeli border. Daylight visits are also prohibited in front of the Military Court. <sep> To force its inhabitants to abandon their land, to exile. <sep> And there, I believe everyone must take seriously this proposal to introduce what are called "Energy Cane". <sep> Meaning they make alliances, they break, they rebuild, based solely on elections and the distribution of power to be represented in Parliament. <sep> And the blood is grave, because it is within an electoral reform that could possibly eliminate the communal best loser system, which today represents a sore spot in our democratic system. <sep> The ILO has written to the government to say that there are several issues in this Bill that are not correct, and negotiations must continue. <sep> So, these troublesome times have brought about an increase in the development of more democracy, more freedom but democracy and freedom are still bitter with a murky history. <sep> So, there is irony sitting at the heart of the central problem of food security. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not everyone agrees with what is happening. <sep> <sep> LALIT, when we set up a platform, we focus on clear points, discussions on class issues, and the importance of class struggle. <sep> <sep> In Toulsiwala, there was a disease affecting many children and especially women. <sep> <sep> It has Keynesian tendencies (advocating for more public spending) and Fabian tendencies (advocating for a social safety net that does not risk disorder among the masses). <sep> <sep> The two Lalit activists who went to Palestine for a solidarity action in 2004 are witnessing what is happening there. <sep> <sep> Comrade Kisna has mentioned how he shared the enthusiasm of comrade Yannick, and how what they experienced there has marked them deeply and profoundly - something that we rarely experience. <sep> <sep> Later, we will review the political parties, one by one, in this first session. <sep> <sep> They largely attribute the 25% depreciation of the Mauritian rupee to the direct economic downturn. <sep> <sep> There is no military solution for what is happening in Sri Lanka. <sep> <sep> The French tourist zone is closing one after the other. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some important reasons why the struggles for socialist demands, the demands in the interest of poor people, are not a matter for a group of people. <sep><sep> Jamouna had a feeling like Nilou, calm water. <sep><sep> This question, too, is not easy. You know, in the social system today, and this is especially true today that the first thing to note is the global capitalist system, is prevailing. <sep><sep> You can start a small business and then if you have talent you can become a big business, and then you can become a bourgeois in the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> But once again, is the ethanol produced in Moris more powerful than the ethanol that can be imported from countries that produce it, such as Brazil? <sep><sep> Seetulsing has a stigma on the NHRC that is not difficult to understand. <sep><sep> On one side, the temporary leaders who raised their heads were motivated by a deep desire to have a small party on Albion or Azur beach under a European roof. <sep><sep> This means that it will be necessary to include an introduction to the election process (Nominee Paper, Counting, etc.) while explaining the danger of becoming the comminale's best loser. <sep><sep> But, before we get into the story, what are these two forces? <sep><sep> Meanwhile, in 2008, we started together with manifestations and trade union vigils in front of Parliament when the government presented and debated the ERA in Parliament. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In France there was a mandatory occupation: A Driving License. <sep> <sep> Is N. Ramgoolam really not ruining this campaign against traditional bourgeois rule as he did in the 2005 elections, creating enough tension to force Berenger and his MMM to join a national unity government? <sep> <sep> We take pleasure in publishing an article that Lindsey Collen, on behalf of LALIT, wrote about the Obeegadoo plan and which was published in Le Mauricien on May 31, 2001. <sep> <sep> But with time passing, she began to realize that those who were coming to see her to defend them for free were going to see other lawyers for cases where there was money to be made. <sep> <sep> When Princess Prathna, Yosi and their eleven disciples were entering Lanka, the capital of Bomatom Bharat, there was a huge storm from the side of the road to welcome them. <sep> <sep> Workers are giving appearances that they are more in favor of electoral reform. <sep> <sep> - What legislative-level electoral reform is necessary to abolish the Common Loser system. <sep> <sep> If at age 61, people are still walking around searching for a small nest here and there. <sep> <sep> In 1919, just after the Russian Revolution, Lenin, Trotsky and Zinoviev began the formation of the Third International. <sep> <sep> But most importantly for Timi is his dependence on his family. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Election results confirmed that the Labour Party won the district council presidential election, in which they appeared to have won the village elections in which they were not present in time for the festivities. <sep> <sep> This reflects the internationalization of class struggle, with the oppressed class developing a response to capitalist globalization, which often they refer to as commodity globalization. <sep> <sep> He participated in protests during the workers' strikes in Cairo in the last two years. <sep> <sep> They found themselves in a situation where they were always in darkness, where they no longer understood how life was unfolding. <sep> <sep> Rajni received repeated applause during her speech, both during and after. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, she continued the work she was accustomed to doing. <sep> <sep> So the WTO is bringing the crisis closer, faster. <sep> <sep> But why is his argument different from that of WIN, Rama Valayden, the PMSD or any other religious movement, in favor of those four points? <sep> <sep> So many elements in his novel "Mutiny" created an atmosphere of revolt that would occur in February 1999, when the great leader Kaya died in the corridors of Alcatraz. <sep> <sep> Before I begin my intervention, I would like to offer a brief response to a question that arose this morning, as well as to show the riches of our Creole language.  <batch_sep><batch_sep> I am having trouble translating the text due to formatting issues. Would you like me to provide a general summary instead? <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He strategically set up his stall to showcase his merchandise well. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the mother tongue has largely been suppressed by the dominant Mauritian Creole. <sep><sep> Union action and all its positive effects also demobilize workers and re-stabilize the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Can Israel, a foreign state in Palestine, dictate to the inhabitants of Hares, in Palestine, about their right to build homes on their land? <sep><sep> Everyone knows how to preserve and transform a variety of food products. <sep><sep> Following the completion of a film, "Chagos: An Unforgettable Paradise," by O. Bancoult with the support of the Le Port Municipality. <sep><sep> Then, there was a true feast: dip, farata, plain lentils; laundry curry, chicken curry, vegetable curry, hummus, spiced tea, laundry bread, red rice, salad, fish, potatoes, vegetables, eggs, macaroni; there was coconut chutney and hot sauce. <sep><sep> A group of people gathered and said: "Hey Mom! We have passed a law; now we exist and call for such and such things!" And if enough countries recognize it, at the United Nations General Assembly, it is acknowledged; it becomes a state. <sep><sep> Life, in its course, started with the rhythm of a free, logical, masculine singularity. <sep><sep> His aim was to reorient the campaign, especially with the global food crisis turning into a systemic crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin began by saying that he is not a 'Pro-Choice' person. <sep> otherwise a wobbly family structure can rather stabilize patriarchy, and I will explain why. <sep> And at the same time, while he is selling his workforce, there are other factors that the boss has on him. <sep> But they are saying 'cannot waste time; must leave it’. <sep> But they all persisted and continued in the same vein, despite more people recognizing the importance of using the mother tongue in formal education today. <sep> But this also forms part of the class struggle, this syncopated tension. <sep> Many people often find themselves in the same place, where political, administrative, and 'institutional' entities of the State are placed. <sep> They are responsible for all the atrocities of the State of Israel and its weapons against people in Palestine every day. <sep> The second layer is to establish a Commission to review the Party's work concerning young people. <sep> Just like an individual, today, in order to respect their god, in a modern democracy, he insists from the moment he enters primary school until university, throughout his life, that what he calls "democratic rights" are respected. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This encounter was funded by certain billionaires and private foundations. <sep><sep> Victimization, when the Central Committee called on activist, Ian Jacob, to come forward to answer a motion of censure for unacceptable blackmail he had carried out just before the Assembly. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen and Rada Kistnasamy have found two different members of WOSA in South Africa. <sep><sep> All these people are light sources in Libya, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, whom the CIA trained, they come from the diaspora. <sep><sep> And the security industry, while it is taking over economic control, it is becoming an armament industry. <sep><sep> When Blair found out that Berenger had finally decided to go to the United Nations International Court of Justice (the Hague). <sep><sep> A member of an animation club, they are all recruiting quite a few new members. <sep><sep> One of these unions has made a request for affiliation to the GWF, but with a threat involved. <sep><sep> The Commission has invited Alain Ah-Vee, a member of Lalit, to animate a session on the ways in which comic strips are used in political life. <sep><sep> This hostile takeover finally represents a total overthrow of the PTr's leadership. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Since the French invaded Mali last month, the Chinese government has decided to set up a new drone base in Niger. <sep><sep>It was clear enough that had we met and discussed, it would have been an event in itself. <sep><sep>The police even had to pursue certain establishments that were sabotaging food production. <sep><sep>Ram Seegobin spoke about Bidze Sithanen, he sorted out the solutions to the crisis that Bidze Sithanen recommended along with the demand in the Lalit program for an Alternative Economy. <sep><sep>So, the governments are looking ahead, from its people, to fill the void left by private companies. <sep><sep>Basically we are looking for a small spot of land, like a village plot, without even knowing who is using this land to assassinate innocent people around the world. <sep><sep>Even if in international instances, the PTr regime had an anti-imperialist discourse, in local practice, it was more or less spreading the representatives of capital. <sep><sep>We support the Burmese people in their struggle against military rule, just as we support the Palestinian people against the illegal military occupation by the state of Israel. <sep><sep>Starting from 2008, the state is removing itself from this regulation and is now saying that it will enter into negotiations between unions and employers, into collective agreements signed by unions and employers, and that this will determine all labor and peace conditions. <sep><sep>When you need to, take it to work, when you no longer need to, ask for a break. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A beautiful town between Mountain Abel and Mountain Jerzim. <sep><sep> Contrary to what I explained earlier, it is clearly noticeable in Marda. <sep><sep> Even though Timi-Balram did not buy land around them with a plow, their way of organizing the garden, irrigation, and fencing allowed them to increase productivity. <sep><sep> They have already exceeded the target from 520,000 tons total to 450,000. <sep><sep> In the past, there was manipulation between GWF and MMM, where the General Secretary of MMM, acting as a spokesperson for GWF, where the disagreement begins when it comes to helping the MMM electoral campaign, leading to the potential aid for MMM. <sep><sep> If it were a program of good faith that the Government was proposing, it would begin by ensuring and subsidizing 24-hour transport in all regions. <sep><sep> There is a lot of interest in the history of our country, especially in a time frame of 30-35 years ago, when the Bourgeoisie started to consider the Workers' and PMSD party, who at the time, were struggling to represent their interests properly, it was the Bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> For example, the understanding of why we support the decriminalization of abortion, our opposition to police brutality, our opposition to forced labor, our questioning of the dominant ideas of private property. <sep><sep> The anti-democratic tendency of Paul Berenger is becoming more evident with the strategies he is using to rig the municipal elections that are supposed to take place this year. <sep><sep> * After watching a documentary by Emanuelle Bom about the daily lives of two children aged 10, 15 who work very hard on a mountain farm in Nabluz. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was neither a director, President, Secretary, Treasurer, nor any other bureaucrat. <sep><sep> We did a, b, c to contribute to ending apartheid, and we are doing, will do, and must do m, n, o to end the colonization of Palestine and Chagos. <sep><sep> The term "historic bloc," is also, a term that Gramsci left as a legacy. <sep><sep> Internal turmoil within the MMM continues with several resignations in the regional party (and with the MBC making a big deal about it) but the MMM regains Madun Dulloo in March 2008, after he was dismissed by Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> Because these leaders do not align with the actual social list. <sep><sep> Thus, people in the village used to call it the Red Bean Association. <sep><sep> If we look at the 4 slogans we put on our flag, one by one, we will find that there have been consequences in all of them. <sep><sep> We take pleasure in publishing notes on which Ally Hosenbokus based his speech. <sep><sep> "State" is a very complex concept, it is one that is involved in the most difficult things to understand in modern society. <sep><sep> To do this kind of production, we need a lot of clay. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The slave master took away your freedom until you are 80 years old, from morning till evening, owning your life and labor, nothing. <sep><sep> He went deep into his disinterest and refused to talk to farewell his brother when he was leaving. <sep><sep> If we do not understand, we will not understand anything. <sep><sep> Internally, the PT also has different groups defending different classes. <sep><sep> When he returned, he learned that his village was under water. <sep><sep> In fact, there were only fart gas that came out and made noise in the air! <sep><sep> How many Israeli soldiers have been killed on the mountain when they were bringing their coffin to eat grass on the mountain. <sep><sep> Also, because there are many parties that are experiencing massive emigration. <sep><sep> This kind of strange situation has happened without commenting the press. <sep><sep> It is clear that their members are looking at their interests in a way that they find them closer to an "consumer" rather than an active participant. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, he should choose his words more carefully. <sep><sep> Nuclear energy is dangerous in the event of an accident and accidents are always unpredictable. <sep><sep> Before I fell ill one evening, I met Tantinn Ganga at the hotel where I was working. <sep><sep> Balram looked at it with a sweet, grateful, and admiring smile. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin explained that since we launched our campaign, we have made several attempts to interest trade union movements in it. <sep><sep> These 5 unions cannot cooperate enough to address real problems within the union. <sep><sep> Secondly, those who already have this vision, such as Travayis and MMM, they have already analyzed the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Join our campaign! Join LALIT! Lil-Light LALIT has launched a 28-page booklet called Current Political Situation: LALIT Situation within: Must Join LALIT. <sep><sep> "Lalit Lit," he said, "Is to give young people a kind of knowledge that they do not receive in school, university, or work. <sep><sep> The capitalist movement and merchandise are becoming increasingly globalized. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The CSG seems to have entered a crisis, no longer able to function. <sep><sep> Basically, we need to understand that the security reasons the government here, as well as in America, are creating a certain caution, the reason for this is that we should not get involved. <sep><sep> You can learn financial law, banking law, contract law, criminal law, maritime law, land law, space law, there's no course in any university where there are students / citizens learning military law. <sep><sep> In 1 - 4, Port Louis shares it, and the FSM has one too. <sep><sep> If it overestimates its role, it may err as well. This is called "subjectivity". <sep><sep> In its beginning, MR, and now Jack Bizlall, individuals like Georges Ah-Yan or Rezistans ek Alternativ occasionally focus on very specific problems. <sep><sep> All these countries have integrated a capitalist economic system. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we find it ridiculous that the fiction of poverty exists in 229 "pockets". <sep><sep> For a while now, there has been a division between "good" schools and ZEP schools. <sep><sep> Timi was afraid that his son would destroy his life with recklessness. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this is different from the bourgeois state in other countries such as Europe, for example. <sep><sep> We only propose that all 20 on the party list be faced by people who have faced the electorate in constituencies, meaning they have dual candidacy. <sep><sep> Neither Ashok Subron nor Veena Dholah, who had played a leading role in the Central Committee, have objected. <sep><sep> Descending into the street has the potential to bring about a big setback, but only on the condition that we demonstrate our unity based on a program that, together, we all understand. <sep><sep> In other countries, many other Marxists, many other politically active individuals, had already begun to work, had already begun to realize that in a colony, colonial power establishes a State, a State which can dominate all social classes. <sep><sep> It is seeking to have capitalists put their hand on the workers' pension fund. <sep><sep> At the same time, we understand the linkage between our political program and our political organization, with our party. <sep><sep> Today, there is pressure from certain quarters to keep us dependent on these private producers. <sep><sep> It did not bond with anything, except confidence, hope and demand. <sep><sep> They were afraid he would die of old age. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is the government of this country where this multinational that had to be sent back abroad operates. <sep><sep> This also makes union training and union unity very difficult. <sep><sep> o Food production did not need to enrich capitalist profits; <sep><sep> Any peaceful program, and especially how to get active participation. <sep><sep> In short, despite the fact that it was going towards electing a Constituent Assembly, there is a certain fluidity now. <sep><sep> Reminder in December 2005 where 4 government deputies were arrested at Schipol Airport in Holland when they were boarding a plane to come to Mauritius with a suitcase full of more than 25 kilos of heroin. <sep><sep> IRA voted in 1973 and it continued to be valid until 2008. <sep><sep> If this does not work out, soldiers draw their carbine. <sep><sep> Because of your downfall, because of the price differences, people in other countries - you take all the footballers we find 3 times a day on TV - those people who earn Rs 1 million a week! <sep><sep> The most dangerous lands were in the lower lands, especially in the Montagne des Poux area. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have a technical fault here, where it started was that the Government, including its PMSD, but especially its MSM and its Workers, have exposed their corruption through the purchase of the Medpoint. <sep> <sep> The people of Lamas have indicated that they have chosen a team with a score of 60-0, there is no need to rely on people for the common criteria. <sep> <sep> However, they continue to challenge the Best Loser by their cases. <sep> <sep> Even though maternity leave lasts 12 weeks, when a woman becomes pregnant, she will have to work at a rate that can last up to 12 hours of work per day. <sep> <sep> Even though it says on its official website that the money will "nourish the economy", according to Mauritian employers and a successful government, they understand that this means "making the sugar industry profitable". <sep> <sep> There was already a subtitle in Creole, but for those who do not know how to read and write, it did not help. <sep> <sep> Then he will ask all married people to form a group to pull the boat out of the difficulties. <sep> <sep> Afterwards, it was the communalists who took it back. <sep> <sep> So, when Mauritian Creole is introduced in schools, we need to maintain fluidity in this approach, so that we create a dynamic process that goes towards the maternal language as a medium. <sep> <sep> Repression against the Pa Bush Platform had already begun. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another big sum from his return tax from his private Hotel, Bank and others who have made excessive profits last year, profits on the backs of workers and on the backs of workers as well as on bank clients. <sep><sep> More than 10,000 youths from 4 different neighboring areas are gathering at Don Bosco Ground. <sep><sep> Helpers in shops, supermarkets, etc. receive a monthly salary of Rs 4,000. <sep><sep> His works also, when they are published, criticize the British Communist Party, which had control and did not put many words on its ecological work. <sep><sep> He was in the LINITE PROGRESSIST team that won the village elections in 1979 and brought a lot of sanctions to the village of Bambous. <sep><sep> He infiltrated the Ministry of Youth and Sports, organizing "leadership" courses for young people. He also has influence in the press. <sep><sep> Odek, Disel has finished drinking the sea, lepons are burning the sand; niaz lao get a fever forty, looking for a way to escape from death; a last dolphin is crying, there are no ears to listen to it. <sep><sep> They understood the importance, because LALIT has a member, Sadna Jumnoodoo, a nurse, who has persistently raised this issue for 20 years at the level of its union, at the level of its site, since before this team took power in the Nursing Association. <sep><sep> All the children born outside of Palestine do not have the right to Palestinian citizenship. <sep><sep>And when an economic crisis that is "systemic" occurs, that's when all the veils that conceal the truth begin to fall. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Where construction is concerned, it is a sector with self-limitation within the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> Moreover, for example, if an electoral fraud case against Ashok Jugnauth was in a different political context, if the press didn't bring a campaign against him, would he have resigned by force? <sep> <sep> After several months, when he went to deposit, documents have been deposited, Form 13 has been submitted, receipts have been shown, everything, finally, the IEC said "No! <sep> <sep> There is also a series of irregularities and collusion from where, arise conflicts concerning CT Power and other coal-fired power plants. <sep> <sep> Many comrades here have read in newspapers yesterday and today, the establishment of the sugar company Medine, immediately after Bidze came up with an ambitious plan. <sep> <sep> Firstly, it is an analysis, and secondly, it is the demands that arise from this analysis, what we call "demand", and three. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, in the last general election, nearly half of the candidates were women. <sep> <sep> And when we meet, we give value to these standards. <sep> <sep> 1,500 Palestinians have survived with severe physical disabilities. <sep> <sep> Has Navin Ramgoolam's concession made progress in combating politically targeting? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a need for a sustainable agricultural policy to increase food production, food consumption for local consumption to reduce dependence on imports, and also food for processing and preservation for exports. <sep>

<sep>Its definition has also been widely criticized because it is vague and lacks appropriate indicators to measure the actual impact of the development and economic activities that are taking place. <sep>

<sep> He used it to get through the little gap behind their houses. <sep>

<sep> Means that he committed a sacrilege and to purify his name he had to spend forty days of penance in the desert. <sep>

<sep> Shouldn't it have used the effect that Mauritius has a "high moral ground", Mauritius which has international rights by its side. <sep>

<sep> Today it is often difficult to break those links from that time because after that people went to serve Darwin's theory of evolution in rather fascist ways ("social Darwinism"). <sep>

<sep> In relation to the electoral reform commission (Carcassonne) where Ramgoolam commissioned it and where personally briefed, we found that the Prime Minister would have power. <sep>

<sep> In the LALIT Press Conference held on Tuesday afternoon, April 13, Ram Seegobin spoke in front of a group of journalists representing the press, radio, and MBC TV. <sep>

<sep> And he did this through just two or three points in a Bill. <sep>

<sep> Kaya, Reginald Topize, who died on February 21, 1999, when he was in Alcatraz, Port Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are in Parliament today, in the National Assembly, in the Opposition, the final opposition. <sep><sep> I believe our party is the only one that has had a political program for a long time that includes demands for the decriminalization of abortion. <sep><sep> Participants in the forum described how the closure of the French nuclear weapons testing sites in the region has closed one chapter. <sep><sep> But, we must ensure that China and its allies here and around the world do not provoke anything to prevent this important progress for the Palestinian people. <sep><sep> Apart from school duties and housework, it was not interested in anything else. <sep><sep> The police are like the police in Mauritius - with large blue trousers and light blue shirts. <sep><sep> Thus, a new member gains access to knowledge and understanding easier than us, who have created the association and developed the content of its program. <sep><sep> - Oh, how beautiful! - Where is Karonn? - I think it's up there. <sep><sep> Why has everyone fallen into drugs, we should not look at that. <sep><sep> So, Lindsey Collen said, Lalit insists that the amendments the government is proposing will make the DPP more independent from the police. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some are prisoners and are not allowed to go to the place where they have to sign for themselves when they do not receive it by mail. <sep><sep> The Diego Garcia case closed with the people against military occupation, like the Palestinian people. <sep><sep> It is today that the Prime Minister is questioning certain flaws in his own policies. <sep><sep> Furthermore, many people find limitations in the work "social", or when campaigning on a single issue. <sep><sep> At Independence, the Mauritian economy had organized the Sugar Industry Conference, which was the largest employer, employing more than 70,000 workers. <sep><sep> - Do not find it funny if the opposition leader comes to offer you a candidacy post. <sep><sep> You will not be disappointed when you read the words of former great economists. <sep><sep> And for more than 50 years, UNESCO, based on scientific studies, has taken a clear position, stating that all Governments oppress the world, stating that all political parties in the world, are better served as a mother tongue as a medium in schools. <sep><sep> If we do not prevent it, Pravind Jugnauth will introduce a real "virus" in the pension system, a virus that will destroy old-age pensions. <sep><sep> But, the crisis has been well cushioned in the past 60 years. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> I apologize for the interruption of the translation. Here is the complete translation of the provided Mauritian Creole text:

<sep> He took leadership for George Ah Yan addressing issues at Foyer Namaste, for example, advising on financial matters. <sep> But indeed, for a single gargoulette to break. <sep> So see what individuals submit their candidacy to represent the people in their constituencies, because due to the principle in the Constitution, they must classify themselves in a communal way. <sep> People who think in a mechanical sense, they no longer give space for "chance." <sep> Yesterday, we have found public support for CNT workers who went on strike to protect jobs and at the same time defend the interests of the CNT, when the Government imposed taxes from private companies on certain CNT lands, in its privatization strategy. <sep> The Employment Relations Act (ERA) has continued to expand despite union division and differences in tactics within the union movement. <sep> Laenn is still allowing Offshore Mauritius to operate as a tax haven; this country which attracts the largest investors in land, is Mauritius's luck. <sep> This implies that there is less democratic control over mother earth, less freedom to live collectively as all the other creators do. <sep> Will this not put the Mauritian government in violation of the Pelindaba Treaty for a free Africa from all nuclear weapons? <sep> Now, like comrade Eddy, you can make ethnicity pass, but are there any new places in the civil service. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is not the MMM or the MSM in the government that will allow classes for workers and poor people to face the difficulties we are going through. <sep><sep> We have seen the birth of the contestation movement which began in May 1975 where girls from colleges were sitting together. <sep><sep> Only thanks to Seychelles and the President of Seychelles have his men not fallen... <sep><sep> On the other hand, Fatma came from a very orthodox Muslim family. <sep><sep> But normally people are not aware that on the sea or in elections or marriages, things come to a different level outside our control by dominant ideologies. <sep><sep> By registering under the Employment Relations Act law it will tell you what you need to submit financial returns every year, for you to come and spend, your minutes of the General Assembly, and a copy of the legal advisor's letter. <sep><sep> Because his life is not the same for all concerned. <sep><sep> Our analysis is that the ruling class, that is the bourgeoisie, the awareness of the serious economic crisis have brought to light all the debates for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> We, as part of LALIT, we are linking all this together. <sep><sep> A single individual has truly sat, drafted everything, in time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that this proposition serves to protect themselves (MMM and MSM) through coordinated efforts during discussions on the Electoral Reform. <sep><sep>Which bourgeoisie section benefits the most from this orientation? <sep><sep>And we find that humanity will have to face incredible problems: <sep><sep> Bizlall and Subron's roles rely heavily on populism, opportunism, lack of comprehension of dialectical links between class struggles and trade union struggles. <sep><sep> So, the law is biased towards the trade union movement and trade union struggles. <sep><sep> Secondly, it has led to an absurdity where The National Assembly elects a President of the Republic for 5 years when all Members of Parliament know he will only stay for 19 months. <sep><sep> So, everyone supports this government, they serve the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The Government of Mauritius organized a visit to Chagos, including Diego Garcia, under the pretext of "visiting every part of the country according to the Constitution of Mauritius" – on board Trochetia. <sep><sep> You know, under the enslavement system, for example, a capitalist does not buy your labor, no, they rent it instead. <sep><sep> Traditional bourgeois opposition parties focus their "actions" much more in Parliament, in Municipal Councils and District Councils, the activity of deputies or PPS in the rural areas, through press conferences, press briefings, through speeches at various inaugurations/events, putting on a show. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes, he doesn't even listen to her when she's talking to him.<sep><sep> Minis has attacked France Telecom, which owns 40% of shares in Mauritius Telecom, for the first time.<sep><sep> At the fast Mr. Jabaljas gave the Lord a horse to follow him to meet that lady.<sep><sep> Then, there was another period where, along with LPT, in the All Workers' Conference for 3-4 years, we were quite progressive and active in the union movement, but unfortunately it went through bureaucratic obstacles.<sep><sep> And a former president, Jacques Chirac, has been sentenced to 2 years in prison.<sep><sep> Could he be a gentleman for us to talk about equality?<sep><sep> He raises the flag and the PLHDWU, then where the PLHDWU, he also, he lets go.<sep><sep> So, for this reason, we can say that the class struggle of workers today, the struggle of all people who need to work to live, it is important for it to become conscious.<sep><sep> If we want to go towards a multi-lingual level, as we want in LPT, we need good education in mother languages up to a certain level, that is, where the mother tongue is the medium.<sep><sep> Q: Express.mu: Prime Minister against mentioning communal belonging, but he says he's never been a sore loser. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since 2005, we in LALIT have predicted this economic crisis. <sep><sep> In the textile sector, there are certain factories surviving in Mauritius. <sep><sep> This bourgeoisie section that we in LALIT call "detached bourgeoisie" are businessmen who own capital and whose workers help to be part of the wealthy bourgeoisie through discreet collaboration. <sep><sep> As for the Chagos issue, for the first time, the Mauritian government, under the Labour Party, is taking legal action against the UK. <sep><sep> JUSTICE, it brings together police brutality victims so that they can formally claim their rights in the long term, raise their voices, protest. <sep><sep> and the government's program both blocks in the elections were completely unable to bring the necessary sanctions so that workers and the poor do not bear all the burdens of this economic crisis. <sep><sep> We have to create together a detailed Manifesto to guide us when we protest, to make explicit where we are going. <sep><sep> Within the Labour Party itself, there are people like Patrick Assirvaden, Shakeel Mohamed, Arvind Boolell who said there should be a new communal census. <sep><sep> Father Martin King must have felt as though he had passed his first test. <sep><sep> We act on current issues, but with a conscious link to a socialist future. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he received Kaya's letter 3 days later, there were 30 knife marks. <sep> In Mauritius, everyone began to recognize that if you don't plant food, you only plant sugarcane; if the boats do not arrive in Mauritius, there will be no food. <sep> (20-25 knife marks, Ram and I go to the plastic chair at BUT, for example, in the continent, over there. <sep> There is a group of Beebeejaun representing a bourgeois section, through the family relationship it has with the company group BAI. <sep> Through its roadblocks and military checkpoints, the system passes and constructs this ray of light into Palestinian territory. <sep> A tactic, it may be good as a tactic, but it is not good if it becomes a strategy. <sep> And the course has allowed all this kind of inconsistency to pass. <sep> For the PMSD leader, he cannot find the truth in the struggle between the classes. <sep> The families who were on the front lines, who were called the "Family Solidarity", the Chagossian families who were in the mobilization movement in 1981, families in the Uprising and mobilization in 1979 and the 1980s, families in the family planning movement, which is a movement that has been active since before the Women's Liberation Movement, families in the movement against police brutality, families in the Labor Front 2009, and families in the trade union struggle in different moments until today. <sep> Present press: Le Matinal, L'Express, Le Mauricien, Le Defi Plus. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At 11:00 pm Nasfat from the village of Marda called to say that tears have been shed in the village of Marda and they are throwing bombs. <sep> Princess Prathna had told you that you need to leave your hole. <sep> We have received a call for a socialist program. <sep> Our first public demonstration, our Reviv 1976, was 100% in Creole language. <sep> It was at the same time that we were facing more repression by the police. <sep> During Labor Day, we, as workers, need to know what to protest against. <sep> They are proposing changes to labor laws to reduce probation. <sep> Five have submitted their verbal resignation at the branch level, and six have submitted their letter of resignation. <sep> In ordinary language, people often talk about who has "power", or who can give "backing". <sep> Berenger has appeared on television threatening civil servants with the IRA. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Fanfan Tabardenn believed that God had given him a mission. <sep><sep> It is remarkable that a police brutality case has sparked a national movement against the government. <sep><sep> Men and women like two quicksilver canaries quickly swam in the water to see what was in the trap. <sep><sep> And as long as there is this, no one will be happy. <sep><sep> When you say Creative Accounting, it means all kinds of accounting trickery, and they want to use all kinds of trickery to reschedule Debt Servicing. <sep><sep> He, he tired the MMM leadership to make them become nationalists and to make them adopt a strategy based on class struggle. <sep><sep> This alone is enough to cause a major disruption. <sep><sep> The class conflict has been predicting this type of crisis for several years now. <sep><sep> When we know that, then we can start to understand the conflict between Radio One and L'Express, between L'Express and MSM, between L'Express and Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> MSM in the past has associated, as we mentioned, with a very repressive police, and a very repressive politics: Anti-worker laws, in favor of death penalty, dirty talk against the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a dangerous terrorist group preparing subversion against Samazeste to put on the throne another king whom they called the true king. <sep>
<sep> But since you have raised this, there are certain loopholes that concern us as well. <sep>
<sep> We need to start thinking about ways like anonymous and free substitution therapy to encourage drug victims to enter rehabilitation centers for recovery. <sep>
<sep> I explain how we found this connection. <sep>
<sep> It seems to be a quite serious corruption if it is true. <sep>
<sep> We need to build on our unity in the past at Bain de Dames. <sep>
<sep> So, in the first session, there were 10-12 families at Lakaz Ros, Forest-Side, sitting around. <sep>
<sep> Why is the crisis "systemic", or "organic" and not just a usual crisis in the capitalist system? <sep>
<sep> I managed to find the olive branch I was looking for. <sep>
<sep> And around the mountain, the different administrators had built fence after fence barrier. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, what is not natural is when there is an organic link between the trade union organization and the political organization claiming to be revolutionary in a pre-revolutionary era. <sep><sep> Government officials are already working on how to conduct a series of tests to determine who is eligible for a pension. <sep><sep> To be more precise, it is the Working Party that existed before the Bolom Ramgoolam group - not the Ramgoolam of today but his father - before the Ramgoolam group entered the Working Party. <sep><sep> Former Minister of Education Parsooramen had introduced a quota for Rodrigues for the first boy and first girl in the CPE exams in each primary school to get a place in the nearest State Secondary School. <sep><sep> In the tourism sector, there is excitement at the Tru-o-Bis hotel, owned by the Beachcomber group, which is trying to smile on the side. <sep><sep> He left and after all that he did not even mention my name on his official speech, which is just a piece of paper. <sep><sep> In a meeting with Marshal, the farmers have explained the difficulties they face in getting access to cowfeed subsidies from the Government. <sep><sep> In conclusion, all members and sympathizers of the LPT, our students and teachers, our friends and also honored by this Prize. <sep><sep> However, he used to criticize the oligarchy severely in his books. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we also have a special thought for the children in Palestine and in the global context of the anti-war and anti-imperialist American campaign. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In conditions of economic distress, the family must find ways to nourish their family, send children to school, pay bills and light up the house every month. <sep><sep> And in all this, as a "citizen," you do not understand. <sep><sep> The remake starts when Berenger has withdrawn all his proposals on electoral reform and any talks with Ramgoolam have also stopped. <sep><sep> "Where strategy is concerned, what we expect from an anti-capitalist political party, is to recognize that the women's movement is a potential ally. <sep><sep> putting onto the agenda this important election, through our national and grassroots campaign: <sep><sep> special issue in the Census that asks every individual to classify themselves according to their way of life, in one of the specific communities listed in the Constitution. <sep><sep> like the United Nations where there are "nuclear powers" that have veto rights, like France's military and colonial presence in the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> It reconstructs the GWF with a new trade union, and resists SILU alongside GWF, through JNP. <sep><sep> Sweet talk from the very wealthy US Goverment is evidently looking for an ideal socio-political climate for its negotiations. <sep><sep> This long-term work, this stress is sometimes hidden by focusing on efficiency, productivity, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So when learning a foreign language, it is also challenging; because, like all good educators know, you cannot think as well in a language you do not know as in a language you master perfectly. <sep><sep> But that does not mean that when Sithanen sits on a point, if he repeats a little, says for example, Severenns Alawenns, he makes a compromise, and we all agree. <sep><sep> Shakeel Mohamed came up with amendments that the union found unacceptable. <sep><sep> But as Samy liked to say, the hen was dripping like a calabash. <sep><sep> Here are some of the problems with the minister, as well as him. <sep><sep> - often waiting for exams due to being blocked at Chekpynt Miray. <sep><sep> This kind of expense has not been the same level since 1989, and the government refuses to invest in other production. <sep><sep> - The life and health of workers must come before everything else. <sep><sep> But now, today, when we are in a crisis, many of these demands are back on the agenda. <sep><sep> When we are finding a new valorization of "sugar cane", when refining brown sugar to make white sugar, when using molasses to make ethanol, when burning bagasse to make energy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Central LALIT Committee discussed the topic of redistribution of wealth, and its significance for society and for prisons, and for the link between the two. <sep> <sep> Its place where it stands, it is terribly important, and this place it becomes a symbol for the living society of mankind on Earth, for the rapid and simultaneous passage of time (by second, by year, by millennium), for the destruction and construction of mankind within the framework of nature. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin mentioned that Lalit is not aligning with candidates because there is initially a system that encourages bipolarization between two electoral blocks. <sep> <sep> And, effectively, today the Carcassonne Report is out on Electoral Reform. <sep> <sep> So, when Ragini goes "breaking the olive branches", it is not ordinary harvest, but all political work is simultaneously ensuring that the harvest goes forward. <sep> <sep> In 1967, with the occupation, 2 million workers from the West Bank and Gaza became daily wage laborers in Israel. <sep> <sep> During that time in 1976, important things were happening in that context. <sep> <sep> And then, we saw the Ut 79 strike within that framework, within the broader context of the LALIT working class, the way it unfolded. <sep> <sep> This is how I lived through Ut 79 in many ways. <sep> <sep> Certainly on a regional level, on the angle of Ebenn, there is an expansion, recruitment, new members are joining, on the level of Kirpip a new life, exists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>And then, when the MSM government finally left, we saw Berenger and his MMM starting to attack the workers, saying they are primarily responsible. <sep><sep> Facing the reality of today, we are seeing certain demands that could improve the conditions of families, but also highlighting the inequality in society responsible for the domination and oppression of women. <sep><sep> Even more critically, there is a serious issue of women's rights involved. <sep><sep> Everything we have done is based on past experiences, different forms of struggle, and with programs and mobilizations that come from the daily lives we live. <sep><sep> When we decide to boycott the Mauritius Labour Congress (MLC) strike in the textile industry today, everyone in SILU and UASI has realized that. <sep><sep> Every government should also provide the same subsidies to any international private sector that comes, for instance, the university sector here, which provides IT, ICT and the University of Mauritius. <sep><sep> We are discussing using this nationalist strategy to combat imperialism. <sep><sep> Some people believed that the Chinese State would bring economic development despite everything. <sep><sep> It is called 'The Dame'... It is somewhat paradoxical that the first nursery rhymes that a Mauritian child learns in its English class are those rhymes which, as we say in English, are 'heavily laden with racial stereotypes'. <sep><sep> 43 years since Independence, history has shown us that these traditional political parties have behaved like courts, as facilitators to allow the bourgeoisie in profitable economic sectors to continue to reign over the suffering of workers and the masses of people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When they found another alliance, that is, MSM-MMM-PMSD should have fired. <sep><sep> We tend to forget that our country is on a military base. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, dancing there, it can also become a multinational company, or even a project like City Power. <sep><sep> These people do not think about the divisions that the current system is making, when it already favors those children who speak French and English at home. <sep><sep> It wasn't like that, neither in the '30s, nor in the '70s. <sep><sep> Work - The media has announced a bill to legalize abortion under certain conditions. <sep><sep> Yesterday the USA and UK made it clear that "the treaty did not affect their activities on Diego Garcia, located in the middle of the Indian Ocean." <sep><sep> We warn the government not to use any delaying tactics. <sep><sep> It appears that several times a military ship has docked in the villages since early morning. <sep><sep> And when you impose a policy, you impose a "dress code", an ideological framework, to make people accept this dictatorship. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, as we commemorate, some aspects worldwide and in Mauritius too, have been infiltrated, have been somewhat adapted. <sep> <sep> If you wish to remember, contact the Education for Workers on lptmail@intnet.mu or call Alain Ah-Vee or Lindsey Collen on 208 2132. <sep> <sep> Because L'Estrac replies that there are indeed friends along with him. <sep> <sep> But there is a unique rabbit in Trincomalee, in the North East of Sri Lanka, which is the fourth largest natural rabbit in the world. <sep> <sep> More people voted, but fewer people voted for others outside of the 2 blocks. <sep> <sep> And in November, we found a controversy with a "Consultation Paper" on Marine Protected Area circulating. <sep> <sep> Regarding Trotsky, his essays "Uneven and Combined Development" and Permanent Revolution, are both interesting and can be read in "The History of the Russian Revolution". <sep> <sep> In the energy sector, there was a dispute over the CT Power plant, which led to a major political conflict between the Ramgoolam government and the MMM. <sep> <sep> We will organize meetings that are already scheduled in 4 villages, organize door-to-door visits, meetings in the neighborhoods, meet voters to explain the need to support the LALIT party's policies. <sep> <sep> I remind you, the Prime Minister himself called here, to say yes, we are invited to participate in the Electoral Reform Round Table. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Education for Workers and Literacy, for instance, supports this work. <sep><sep> The work continues, and later comrade Kisna will tell on the web. <sep><sep> For Berenger, it is the most possible, and actually it is possible, but he likes to keep a flood. <sep><sep> 10. We need to control sea fishing, prevent smuggling, and ensure fish stock renewal. <sep><sep> When we arrive in the village of Heres, we go to the shops to buy some things, and when we're going out we find mud in the village entrance. <sep><sep> Last time Tras played, he played mostly in Moris. <sep><sep> But the results of JUSTICE have now become increasingly difficult for the police to enforce violence and prevent prosecution afterwards. <sep><sep> It is part of the same general systemic crisis in the world. <sep><sep> "He went outside the logic and began to oppose the United Nations resolution and international law violation." <sep><sep> Then Rama Valayden focused his attention only on the moment when he was remassing an electoral base on a communal basis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was born after the death of his father. <sep><sep> and in favor of strengthening military bases, electoral reform including the abolition of the communal Best Loser system, education, against the reintroduction of the death penalty. <sep><sep> There is an English and French version of this poem that can be used for translation. <sep><sep> There is a disorganization in distribution and some stores are selling it later. <sep><sep> We have already developed over the last 35 years a quite detailed analysis on the “state bourgeoisie,” a section of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Its price is linked to demand and supply, and it, like the dollar for capitalists. <sep><sep> - 'Upset! Make them throw up.' Dharam Raj said. <sep><sep> Circulate this call in your college, university, association or union. <sep><sep> They are discussing ways to support the hunger strike of the prisoners in their meeting tomorrow. <sep><sep> Chalmers Johnson, who has previously worked for the CIA, has served as a State Department advisor and is also a university professor in political science. He also has a television program that talks about geopolitics, in order to strengthen military bases in the region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee has given an example of someone who is overqualified, but has not been able to find a job for a year. <sep><sep> And then the leadership position became stronger because the people liked it and it caught on, shouting loudly, "That's the man!" <sep><sep> There was some mobilization around the water issue, for example in Le Morne, as well as in Les. <sep><sep> It is essential to address inequality by redistributing wealth, attacking the system that produces inequality. <sep><sep> LALIT agrees to overhaul the system of placing petty criminals in prison. <sep><sep> For a lecture by Lindsey Collen, more of a question-and-answer session. <sep><sep> This paper is written by LALIT member, Lindsey Collen, and is based on her notes for her intervention in a JUSTICE meeting, in which she is a member. <sep><sep> In the first session on "What is a political party", Alain Ah-Vee explained ideas about politics and political parties from Aristotle to today. <sep><sep> When you look at them closely, you realize they have backing. <sep><sep> During this time, LALIT organized together with other organizations, at the WSF, to establish the NO BASES network, a more politicized network, to allow the anti-war movement to have a more political program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the 1970s, the situation in Pakistan has worsened. <sep><sep> And if there is a party that has systematically brought this campaign it is LALIT. <sep><sep> and this gives it the possibility of succeeding in the long term when we put it in a political program instead of a strict punishment in society. <sep><sep> and a series of other institutions, even some with a repressive aspect, their main role outside of crises is a role of "coercion," meaning they are persuasive, but through more ideological force than brute force. <sep><sep> An essential article for reading is called "Advertising: The Magic System." <sep><sep> It didn't control them because he knew what he wanted, what he was doing. <sep><sep> A jazz, this evening, which takes root, as everyone agrees, both in African culture and in this performance, jazz lives to its fullest maturity, it is also in African culture. <sep><sep> And we can say that this Conference has really saved us money. <sep><sep> It was more due to pressure from, on one side, MMMSP Dev Virasawmy and Lel-gos Bizlall (who was then a member of MMM) who left the class struggle to go towards nationalism. <sep><sep> So, providing food security for people in a country, it doesn't come through planting that country in other countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, we need to create a conscious program and strategy to create a movement that creates a different economic policy that is not only based on sugar, textiles, hotels, and not in the hands of a select few individuals seeking their own profit margins. <sep><sep> Our media, our people seeking to change society radically, it is very different. <sep><sep> I have taken these as general practice violations involving gross police brutality and police violence. <sep><sep> They did not see themselves as industrial workers. <sep><sep> Then, on the other hand, there is what is called "buying power" which means finding something in the middle, giving a slight increase, changing labor conditions slightly and then pulling what is called an Award. <sep><sep> That is, in a sector like the French Zone where a manager has a lot of people under him he can hire a lot of people, if he does not have he can lay off, if he regains he can hire people again. <sep><sep> Where the important implementation is for everyone to know what we are talking about. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, income tax has been reduced, while the common people have had an increase in taxes on SMS, washing and cigarettes. <sep><sep> Because in Mauritius there is a lot of knowledge and experience in the fields of plantations, fisheries, as well as in the preservation and transformation of agricultural products. <sep><sep> The installation of this military base is responsible for the suffering of the Chagossians who have been displaced from there, as well as the suffering of the Mauritian people who have been affected by the Chagos excision by the USA-UK. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was the first time since the Roosevelt election that someone spoke of "working people" and against big capital itself. <sep> And in fact, there was a revolution in decline, and it began with a simple Presidential election. <sep> Everyone knows that the majority of us do not easily accept new ideas. <sep> For him to migrate, in its form, it is a national level migration, but it is not national in its content. <sep> This military presence, its purpose is to familiarize the Mauritian population with a militarized presence. <sep> Let's look at trends that can separate these three elements. <sep> Opinion journalists are writing articles with common content and common language are spreading among Facebook users. <sep> Class politics It would have been good for us to understand a bit when we say class politics, what exactly are we saying. <sep> The line in almost all international news follows word-for-word the dominant line in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in France. <sep> We found that it is Anerood Jugnauth and Nando Bodha who took seats in an Air Mauritius inaugural flight to Shanghai, as a symbol of this trend. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We believe in a comprehensive education system / in holistic development, starting from kindergarten, continuing until we become grandparents. <sep><sep> It's not just about working hard, it's not just about earning a salary, we find for example in Lemet Kaya, the number is not enough. <sep><sep> Because of military spending, we had to close schools and hospitals. <sep><sep> We no longer agree with the Workers' Party and its social alliances that have the same policy and do not represent a credible alternative. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam has finally replaced Soodhun by Minister PMSD Sik Yuen. <sep><sep> The Dinesh government was trying to resist to prevent the population from suffering but the law of multinational profits shattered all its efforts. <sep><sep> He took a rural direction where laughter and music were coming out and when he was about to arrive late, he hid behind a lilac tree to observe twelve young men approaching him lazily. <sep><sep> He wanted to say when the newspaper outlined a black square where an article had been removed, that practice, he also declared illegal. <sep><sep> organized by the Association of Social Workers of Mauritius, chaired by Imran Dhannoo, to protest against Israel's massacre in Gaza. <sep><sep> For some time there have been discussions on relevance, with Steve Obeegadoo, Alan Ganoo and Ajay Gunesh positioning themselves for this role. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a tool that can be used by the Government to reform and restructure certain sectors to bring in competition. <sep> No representatives for the Council of the Village Opinion on Abolition were invited. <sep> At that time, in America and Europe, there was almost no work. <sep> Like the previous week, Lalit sent a copy of the letter to Levek. <sep> where the consciousness of the class is higher at one point than at another where it can be lower, or even much lower. <sep> The sugar industry has almost completely removed all of its permanent workers, from 50,000 to 3,500. <sep> And one year before the strike, many trade union leaders went to various professions where they became distributors of the Lalit de Klas movement (workers, artisans, doctors, transport workers, gas fitters, teachers, nurses, construction workers in the ACH, etc). <sep> It continued to have a monopoly on a lot of land, on a lot of capital, and on monopolistic decisions on 'land'. <sep> There are other difficulties with the concept of 'Mauritianism', with this category of 'Mauritian'. <sep> Since we were still in MMM, we brought this class. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The artists, Ashish Beesoondial, Pascal Nadal and Stephanie Theodor, accompanied by three percussionists, have interpreted a translation in Kreol of the text 'Lemorn'. <sep> It can contain analysis, understanding of what is on the capitalist system and you can communicate your understanding not only to workers who are more understanding, but to workers who have a political consciousness. <sep> We had 2 Marxist visitors who animated political education sessions in 2008: Mike Cole from England on education and Nadja Rakowitz from Germany on Marxism. <sep> We say the government must use land as required and develop agro-industry to produce for the country and for export. <sep> What does it mean, in other words it has, what should I say? - It made you go crazy. <sep> Ram Seegobin says that LALIT protests against the presence of these 2 American warships in a period where the American military base in Diego and Chagos is in question. <sep> You can follow my statement strictly in 7 parts: <sep> and I already declared our Campaign for an Alternative Economy before 2004. <sep> This will help in times of class struggle when workers find it necessary to use all their creativity to develop new forms of organization. <sep> In 2004 at the World Social Forum in Mumbai, Lalit together with a delegation from the Chagos Refugee Group (GRC), participated in the founding conference of the Anti-US Military Base Network. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The political situation in Palestine today: a power struggle between the occupying forces, the PA (Palestinian Authority), and Freedom Fighters. <sep><sep> All this to say that LALIT had neither the courage nor the discouragement of youth before this war. <sep><sep> The only fault is that Nilou, Prem, and their two children often came to see her. <sep><sep> She said in the same book that these rights can be stopped. <sep><sep> Nursing School is private, the Government is also promoting it as a business. <sep><sep> Since the beginning of this year, we had started reflecting on the election process. <sep><sep> (4) Infrastructure and institutions have been established to support these sectors. <sep><sep> Nowadays, Alain Ah-Vee says, they have meetings, eat together, and organize in different groups in the war. <sep><sep> In the late night of Friday, September 22, 2008, the Social Alliance Government passed two laws to replace the Labor Act (1975), and the Industrial Relations Act (IRA:1973). <sep><sep> There is a new commission being formed to review our work on behalf of the youth. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The current crisis in economic coordination at the global level is making the upper classes acknowledge that they no longer have the same capacity of influence as before. <sep><sep> A "gender" strategy is a policy that allows women to have a greater role in society. <sep><sep> The government has encouraged almost all Mauritian families to live in endless cycles of family conflict. <sep><sep> * Our family members participated in large demonstrations and court cases in 1981. <sep><sep> However, the Trade Union Platform has been accused of collaborating with a disbanded MMM. <sep><sep> - Karonn, where are you going? - Ayoyo, he is calling me. <sep><sep> They prefer to remain quiet on military bases, on the issue of reunification of Mauritius, and on the suffering of Chagossians. <sep><sep> With a country where only capital reigns. <sep><sep> • A proportional representation in order to have more diverse political representatives in Parliament: <sep><sep> The MMM agrees to change the General Population to become Creoles and other Christians. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Until then, the country was on the verge of bankruptcy, and had to accept a package from the IMF and the World Bank so that the big German banks would not go bankrupt. <sep><sep> Next to it, the bourgeoisie was bounding with rice fields, and the workers were established in factories. <sep><sep> But, just before the election, the Labour Party did two things that allowed it to win more than a 2/3 majority. <sep><sep> Countries that have changed to an unimaginable point, as Rajni has said. <sep><sep> It is very possible, even if it is no longer the prerogative of the Prime Minister as it was before. <sep><sep> But the government had already attacked local democracy by postponing local elections for half the population living in villages for a year. <sep><sep> They knew how to do business in the market, who could give credit, which fabrics or suits could be bought to resell at a profit. <sep><sep> On his hundredth birthday, almost a year later, the Minister of Social Security arrived at home accompanied by journalists from the newspapers and television to give him a blood pressure check and a check for a thousand rupees. <sep><sep> There were no words in his budget for alternative sector development. <sep><sep> All slogans were on 3 lines: return to Diego, return Diego to Mauritius, compensation, strengthen military bases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They believe they are building their own culture, opposite to this great current of history. <sep> <sep> Systemic crisis here, in the last 8 years or so, it has become when this arrangement to produce disk, and to do import and export with Europe, it is no longer compatible with the current globalization model. <sep> <sep> He proposes to take him in his cart, take him to the hospital. <sep> <sep> Timi had returned home sad, tired and discouraged. <sep> <sep> There are members who have spoken about the importance of the mother tongue in this process. <sep> <sep> We are thinking, if I am late, the police will come running after me. <sep> <sep> To reduce bureaucracy, instead of having recourse to more democracy, they have recourse to more autocracy. <sep> <sep> When youngsters get frustrated because they see they have no future? <sep> <sep> Even the Court was a Court of Peace, the government at that time had to put in the preamble of the Court his opposition to military aggression. <sep> <sep> We will see if this government has the political will to diversify, especially in agriculture, and encourage agro-industrial development to ensure food security. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since Duval announced his retirement, the situation has worsened. <sep><sep> The boss now makes me do the same work that he used to do long ago, but pays me less. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the National Assembly is imprisoned by the political dictatorship. <sep><sep> Berenger, meanwhile, has cut all contact with MMM and the Labour Party. <sep><sep> Why are there more than 50,000 people without work? <sep><sep> The Electoral System Committee is unable to determine how the current electoral system works, while the National Women's Rights Commission "notes that the government is reinforcing the current electoral system." <sep><sep> In the women's movement, it has become evident that the more power women have in a society, the less violence there is against women: the more empowered women are, the less violence there is. <sep><sep> However, I strongly believe that for Class D to promote to Class C, and then to exit C and enter B, there must be a solid plan in place. <sep><sep> People estimate that the price of petrol will exceed $100 per barrel next year. <sep><sep> However, given that a program is not sufficient on its own. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But a systemic crisis, its peculiarity is that the entire parish is collapsing. <sep><sep> But we should not take them as something physical, that is fixed, that is frozen in time. <sep><sep> Balram, Timi and Samy agreed to support him because the work was progressing well. <sep><sep> The topic we will discuss today is "Work and alienation", it is one of the most complex, most discussed, yet most interesting topics. <sep><sep> His excuse was that he had started working early and was finishing late because Mr. Ibrahim, who had a lot of business to take care of, asked him to take charge of the shop. <sep><sep> It is extremely important to gain a historical perspective because without a historical perspective, we will not be able to understand major issues. <sep><sep> We support him through meetings, meetings, assemblies, petitions, open letters, articles, debates, demonstrations. <sep><sep> Come and sign the petition we are sending to the United Nations. <sep><sep> Then, with a single tooth, they take action, they take their position. <sep><sep> Then there was a first meeting on the 9th of May, and there was a long debate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A big first because it was the first time that MBC invited comarad Ram on a television program. <sep><sep> The biggest sugar cane planter (a person who holds a large permanent concession) who acted as the class director of the political block. <sep><sep> What kind of reform in regional administration should there be? <sep><sep> Does it make you believe that you are part of the same thing, meaning that "private property" is a good thing for everyone. <sep><sep> We borrow a lot of money, then go to see Saydama, where he is. <sep><sep> including computer science, it is in this perspective that we say that information technology must be accessible to everyone without any monetary constraints. <sep><sep> When we read about Mrs. Nandini Soornack  killing her business partner Mr. Gooljaury, we take it as a divergence. <sep><sep> Q: Comrade Pillay: We are talking about communalism, we are talking about the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Contrary to what Dev Virahsawmy said in the press, the Morisian Creole Academy managed to bring together in a single strict framework, skills, experience, and enthusiasm: <sep><sep> The government must change the name and attribution of the "Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute" (MSIRI) to "Mauritius Agricultural and Agro-Industry Research Institute". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the Bijaye Madhou era, the information provided was like a mini meeting with the main speaker Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> Coming back to the present day, the fax, email and other methods of communication are flourishing in various embassies around the world. <sep><sep> Within the International Women's Peace Service (IWPS), there are requests from coordinators in villages for support. <sep><sep> Well, as I pondered on the ways, I wanted to see the impact of the Ut 79 Law, I had 2 possibilities. <sep><sep> Which are producing solar energy, combining motors, differentials in temperatures in the sea, wind energy, in short, sustainable and renewable energy. <sep><sep> However, it appears that this is without changing the power dynamics among different classes. <sep><sep> But once again, are we aware that the influence created in construction and hotels, directly. <sep><sep> With our Assembly Members, with our Branches, where discussions are held in all districts, decisions made are reflected in the Central Committee. <sep><sep> We must keep our distance from the press and its influence. <sep><sep> In protests against ERA and ERiA laws, we find once again the same kind of competitive maneuvers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Workers' Party is forced to delay the elections for the village council. <sep><sep> Against the privatization of the CEB, the Government and CEB are turning towards reserves and massive investments in modern, clean, and truly renewable energy sources. <sep><sep> With a crowbar, they entered, breaking all locks, stealing 2 laptops, a projector, a computer screen, some cash, and Rs700 from the petty cash. <sep><sep> The day before, it was in Block 104, he was the spokesperson for Block 104, and all 104 members of Block 104 stood as candidates - a purely political action, partisan politics, electoral politics. <sep><sep> They obtained a Nursing direction that the union will control for a period of time. <sep><sep> As it is now under the Labour Act, a working day means 8 hours of work per day. <sep><sep> Similarly, in Lasved, where he lives and currently works, children learn in their mother tongue, Swedish. <sep><sep> This is not just an opinion without arguments, but it is linguistic studies in universities that study the grammar of different languages: they have found no errors in language. <sep><sep> In 2011, we also became more aware of the importance of saving and developing all other strict aspects of our party. <sep><sep> The weakening of the trade union movement is occurring in a context of economic crisis where traditional sectors continue to decline. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have been analyzing the actions and methods that LALIT uses, one by one. <sep><sep> - It gets coverage in Advance, Nation, Mauritius Today, Mauritius Times, L'Express (during its early years). <sep><sep> We have found that various sectors face difficulties. <sep><sep> They have one girl to raise, put her on a long table, give her 2 slaps on the backside, sprinkle a little holy water on her face, then reassure her. <sep><sep> One of their journalists, Shyama Sundur-Ramgoolam, left and went to work directly for the boss. <sep><sep> When a mill closes, according to the Blueprint, artisans receive money (2 months worth of banana services), but they have not received it since that mill closed, no. <sep><sep> it is not possible to analyze the crisis in the sugar industry without taking into consideration the need for massive and urgent creation of the amount of machinery required today. <sep><sep> We want to bring a debate on an electoral reform that includes a deepening of democracy, and is not limited to looking only at partisan interests in the short term or the right to stand for election, or looking only at the best loser communal system. <sep><sep> They have only influenced the press negatively for 7 years. <sep><sep> We look at a few of the reasons that have been given for these resignations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the Constitutional negotiation period for independence, when the issue of the detachment of Diego began to be resolved, we found that the state was pre-colonial. <sep><sep> Also crucial is political will. Together we can change the situation. <sep><sep> In this framework, LALIT has launched a new "documentation space." <sep><sep> The army will not let any international, nor any Israeli go to Nablus. <sep><sep> Their Plan B is to have "middle-class" people nominated in the same way. <sep><sep> What is involved is not just a strategy but also an identification of the actors who will carry out this sanction. <sep><sep> There are different types of political programs that different parties have. <sep><sep> Before that, all we heard were slogans like "Bush out!". <sep><sep> In this Central Committee delegation, we stress that there was Veena Dholah, who is now a resignee. <sep><sep> The Government and para-state guaranteed a certain amount of commands for these new companies, in parallel with the historical bourgeoisie which supported its own company. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that point, it creates a relationship of forces between the political force representing the working class and the political force representing the ruling classes that are not favorable to the workers. <sep><sep> It will introduce an amendment to make the strike a constitutional right. <sep><sep> This means, TO DEBATE, this first 62 also, it is important to note, lighted by this mathematics with a number of people in the country in a specific "community". <sep><sep> Their experience is a real estate property blocking their access to a land where they used to go. <sep><sep> If you want papers, contact a member of Lalit. <sep><sep> He is also ambitious, and he represents a faction in the PT. <sep><sep> And maybe, if you want someone with a political sensibility, but short, you can read From Lenin to Stalin. <sep><sep> In the conference on depression chaired by Rada Kistnasamy, there were Alain Ah-Vee, Rajni Lallah, and Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> Not by "mental sanctions" In LALIT, we realize that this guy, he will not come through a "mental sanction" where everyone "conscience" one by one until everyone has a conscience. <sep><sep> And the First International did not say at a time when the working class suffered defeats, forced to become defensive for a while. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee said that when Lalit sent a delegation of 5 members to the World Social Forum in Mumbai, it was also a great first for Mauritius. <sep>
<sep> But, there is another level that he aims for, which is the class struggle, he also aims for when he takes political power, for him to go further, he aims for the abolition of social classes, especially the working class itself.<sep>
<sep> The National Radio-Television was broadcasting news from another planet. <sep>
<sep> Fe Número De: Creole and Bhojpuri exist in writing, and have been for a long time. <sep>
<sep> Sometimes he liked to release his skin on the grass in the carriage, look at the sky and draw on it, listen to songs, stories, goats, birds with the rustling of palm leaves. <sep>
<sep> He knew which smells were good and which were not good. <sep>
<sep> Among us candidates, there are militants and experienced people in the fight for women's liberation, in student and youth movements, in trade unions, in literacy work. <sep>
<sep> How do we, as members of Lalit, view what we call a Crisis, what we call these measures, how does it affect the way we continue our campaign? <sep>
<sep> In this seminar, we analyzed together the economic crisis we are experiencing, it is a "systemic" crisis - it is a crisis that the capitalist system itself produces and that the capitalist system cannot easily resolve. <sep>
<sep> When we go out in the street, we are already in the process of understanding our Program, its analysis, its demands, and how its mobilization will bring about change. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lalit noticed that the process for activating this pursuit had only just begun when Paul Berenger became Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Timi had only told them that they needed to think. <sep><sep> After his university studies, Timinn went to work in many countries until he was around forty. <sep><sep> People began to understand that a legit image is unfolding. <sep><sep> This is what we are starting to do here, today. <sep><sep> They are resisting these conditions, and they are reaching a point where they are questioning the Government itself. <sep><sep> Then Elizier Francois said in a party meeting that when he says that, he says his girlfriend, "I caught you!" That’s how he jokingly used Creole language. <sep><sep> What was he going to do? He didn't know, he was just a student at school. <sep><sep> We have a program, we have activities, but we lack resources and are strict. <sep><sep> But, it's not too serious, because when you don't know if the government will bring the law in or not, it may even deceive you. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Those who are more clever do the same thing, they enter the recycle bin, they re-invent themselves. <sep><sep> This meeting was one of the three preparation meetings for a Public Forum in Bambous. <sep><sep> Bérenger noted that Hurnam is making a call and we need to wait for the results of the call before the MMM takes a position. <sep><sep> In a country where obsession has been happening for so long, one can be answering the phone and chatting with someone while smiling, or realizing another reality. <sep><sep> Following a decision made in a Seminar, we embraced our "internationalism" during this international crisis. <sep><sep> Once again, we have Chagossians leading a long battle, nobody will forget, but when you see the way they approached these 3 elements, they focus on one, the right to return and reparations, on the second they ambiguously take a stance, and on the third they completely avoid taking a position on the core issue. <sep><sep> For them, it's all about the money, they are only interested in their bonuses. <sep><sep> This, in other countries, has caused a rural exodus. <sep><sep> We want equality, we don't want a two-tier system where some people thrive in unequal structures. <sep><sep> In capitalist countries, there was at least one capitalist who controlled the entire state, known as a "Bourgeois State", here we have more renegades: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This time, the disket did not go and discuss the problems of the 5 lalyyn where private companies are entering, the Government says that the salary increase is not a demand. the trade union said.<sep><sep> For example, what is happening in Spain where the weight of the capitalist crisis is shifting on the backs of workers and poor people.<sep><sep> Clearly, the election level will change, the way the election runs, and the way the District President runs, the Workers Party government presents this as a great victory.<sep><sep> It is in the context of this campaign that ISM organized the Freedom March.<sep><sep> Then it brings a campaign that only has 'sub-poverty', and it takes care of these little ones.<sep><sep> Do you know the role of Bandouk, father Yosi, who played in their poverty that forced them to go to the Bannwas? Princess Prathna felt strong that her three gourds and protector were in a big tournament.<sep><sep> Associated with voting in parliament, it is this politics in Moris.<sep><sep> This situation was a blessing for Yosi because his father was so involved in tournaments and sadness that he gave peace and freedom to his boy.<sep><sep> Comrade Alain: Only to take the point that Vijay had raised about meritocracy.<sep><sep> He did this when there were several thousand 'Aderan' supposedly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The capitalist's appetite has grown as they start buying "futures", which means harvesting tomorrow’s resources.</sep><sep> To explain how we move from where we are today to the construction of a socialist society.</sep><sep> Pull the rose bush aside, plant another one next to it, to build a hedge with 3 feet sticking out in all directions.</sep><sep> They cry out that the police are harassing them and are forcing them to pay a fine if they wanted to continue working.</sep><sep> Comrade Ram: When we talk about demobilization among the soldiers, Comrade Yves, may abstract from the reality that influences the individuals' views among the soldiers.</sep><sep> If Mauritius plants the best food here, we can organize bartering, which usually replaces walking when there is a lack of money.</sep><sep> His speech was in the first session, on February 1st.</sep><sep> Then in 1953 we got “sifraz elarzi buku”, in 1959 we got “sifraz iniversel”.</sep><sep> In 1864, in the launch speech of the First International, Marx used this concrete example of working-class solidarity in England, to show the necessity of developing links between workers at an international level.</sep><sep> What characterizes today’s international context is a combination of an ongoing economic crisis affecting almost all goals of the planet, and an ecological crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to be able to advise workers to join the union, to become active in it, and to start acting to get rid of the union bureaucracy and these parasites. <sep><sep> It also puts constant pressure on the government to create jobs. <sep><sep> If a union gives a warning not to strike before the 7th of each month, it means putting a lot of energy into this strike that is coming on the 7th of the month. <sep><sep> But Ramgoolam managed to paralyze the MMM for 3 months of negotiations, allowing it to almost simultaneously fall while Parliament is in disarray. <sep><sep> When the Government begins to draw attention to an important series of articles, it suddenly passes a "Duty-Free Island" decree. <sep><sep> So we can't expect the great intellectuals in social sciences to draw us into problems. <sep><sep> And, for Labor Day 2008, Gregoire had his rallies at Stad Rozil, this year he didn't even celebrate it in the country for Labor Day. <sep><sep> A similar civil war, but not quite, has begun in Lasiri. <sep><sep> I also read Trotsky's biography (together with Trotsky's widow, Natalia Sedova) Vie et Mort de Leon Trotsky. <sep><sep> Better this year, South Independence, we looked at this concept "We are all Mauritian", does that mean we are against communalism? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They also had a session on refining petroleum. <sep><sep> The government needs to stop cooking up the beaches, give it to the hotel owners. <sep><sep> Then in the country, there is a new sector, a new important sector, but it employs many youths. <sep><sep> And we have realized that all of this: the festivals, the music, the meetings, and forums in neighborhoods, it's not enough; everything needs to be connected, there needs to be a certain rhythm. <sep><sep> In general, MPM and RA, who were in the same Bloc 104, together in the same strategy, even when there is a new Court case by Group 72 which includes the Bizlalls, there has been a shift today between RA and MPM. <sep><sep> Many people admire his political intelligence but regret that he only uses it to consolidate his personal power and does not bring development or solve the problems that often block the integral development of Jericho. <sep><sep> So, finally, the Minister of Health announced that we need to look towards Africa. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, all prices keep going up. The cost of living is also increasing. <sep><sep> The ABAEIM Group has put on a beautiful performance with music, poems, and dance during the ceremony. <sep><sep> America has gone into a recession, similar to what it did in Vietnam. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mauritius has never made clear what its position was on voting in favor of this motion! <sep> <sep> In the first batch of scenes, there were children from Site Mère Théresa who were invited with the Saphire association. <sep><sep> Family members get Tickets from the Leader of the Reactionary Party and the Electoral Alliance <sep> <sep> All these illegal acts done by the UK and the USA were done with a single and unique aim: to secure a placement for a military base. <sep> <sep> Workers from other countries, similar to workers who come from Mauritius to work in other countries, are exploited, they are victims of a system. <sep><sep> They presented their program less than 2 weeks before the election, and because their program was so full of emptiness, it had very little utility. <sep><sep> When we use the vague and empty ideological concept of 'Mauritianism', we can see where it can lead us, and where it can lead us. <sep><sep> Because there are these various bureaucracies that have things to lose. <sep><sep> You want to sell a clinic, but sell it yesterday, don't sell it to the Government when there are people in that same structure who are part of the details, who are in the same family who owns the clinic. <sep><sep> The Checkpoint has roads to go to Nablus and the settlements. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen has described the feeling of love that families feel when they have to go get an abortion. <sep> Because the deplorable process that started in the 90s that was connected with the Oslo Accords in 1994 hasn't resolved any issues or provided any relief to suffering Palestinian people. <sep> Meanwhile, alongside her studies, she began drawing graffiti on walls in public spaces. <sep> All of this gives us an insight into the political process that the MMM is engaged in. <sep> This experience was gained through the Education for Workers, where the mother tongue is used in adult literacy as well as in advanced studies and literary fields. <sep> These 43 companies are part of the offshore companies that Enron registered worldwide, in countries where there is no control over accounts and where there is zero tax on transactions. <sep> Even today, there are many things that SAJ leads the Alliance for the Future to. <sep> That PT and MSM represent, neither in favor of the bourgeoisie section called historical bourgeoisie or oligarchy (capitalist since the era of slavery, colonization, forced labor) that the MMM has come to represent, and that Guimbeau and PMSD surely represent. <sep> Kamini looked to her left hospital bed, rubbed, motioned, her legs, dizzy, into the corner of the feverish room, which had shone almost her whole life left in a body broken by a terrible disease. <sep> There is no doubt that 2-3 political parties and a private sector leader during the time before Independence had signed authority to sell a British slave vessel to another. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The worker juggles between these 2 realities. <sep> The organization here and in other countries with which we have partnered and which has supported our work <sep> With its slogan "One people, one nation", it promotes its own anti-criminal law, by replacing the empty slogan "one people, one nation". <sep> This is not an unfounded allegation, it is true. <sep> Everyone still remembers the famous 57 million "deal" that the first MMM-PSM government offered to the Security Industry. <sep> There are a total of 546 control points in the West Bank, and 76 in Hebron alone. <sep> There has been outsourcing of licenses, where it is more profitable for employers to close down here and relocate licenses to other countries. <sep> Sometimes the historical bourgeoisie considers that it is losing ground: then there are public conflicts such as the recent ones between the government and the Lagesse group, and even the MCB. <sep> In order to address unresolved issues, there is another challenge, such as the flight in the Black Rose camp, the MITD, Identity Card, and issues with the regional election results. <sep> To this day, Israel continues to use the same methods against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like us, we turned ideas, discussed with the Assembly Members and Central Committee, and the Central Committee reworked the idea, adjusting it. <sep><sep> Textile output 110,000 workers have become 55,000.: <sep><sep> But, me, you, or anyone else, except for Eddy, just like us, if we were doing that bridge, we would have been hitting our heads on that tree until we were dizzy, if we didn't understand the work beforehand. <sep><sep> Imperialist countries like you would normally seek to "control" an event like this (such as France or the US) might not be able to "recapture" the festival. <sep><sep> For people to be able to get into their working rhythm, juggle between checkpoints despite all the intimidation and repression at the checkpoints as a way to resist restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinian residents. <sep><sep> When they signed that contract, the price was $140 per barrel. <sep><sep> Papa Ganga, the boxer, was becoming a colonizer because he was a government broker, supporting the Prime Minister, he was not taking his family into account. <sep><sep> Value-wise, he has 37 out of 69 in the Parliament, including his 2 transphobic friends. <sep><sep> Certainly, it is not what he is doing in Bidze who gave him that majority. <sep><sep> In 2 constituencies Lalit gained more than 3%. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to a statement from the Supreme Court of Mauritius, candidates in a general election are required to declare their "community" and "pronouncement". <sep><sep> Let’s remember a few things, clear enough for our collective reflection: <sep><sep> You cannot be an athlete in America if you want to become a Municipal Councillor; you must win anything, you cannot declare that you are an athlete; you will be licked; you are done for. <sep><sep> What kind of ideas are being fostered in someone's mind? <sep><sep> All this was a big placebo brought by the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> They started peddling Vichy waters, like a bra made of concrete for the flames. <sep><sep> It’s all acting this way because for a long time Israel has been a denture of the Zion State. <sep><sep> After the Chagos Situation Supreme Court by Ragini Kistnasamy & Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> -Interview of Rajni Lallah with Alex Callinicos, SWP, UK 2008. <sep><sep> It must have the right not to give any testimony, if it doesn't want to. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today PTS has also commented on the rice in its Historic Bloc: <sep><sep> For example, on November 29, there was a protest that was supposed to be a big launch. <sep><sep> So, if we all find danger when we look at the situation in France, we have to ask ourselves whether there is no danger when we start to come to this 'Mauritianism' terrain to fight communalism. <sep><sep> We have our Program, which we have been developing and continue to develop since 2005: on the economy, on ecology, on education, on health, on languages, on freedom, on Palestine, on Diego. <sep><sep> It was entering the electricity sector from the outset. <sep><sep> First point, in ancient times, an imperialist country, the State, the Government and their Army were the ones ruling the lamp. <sep><sep> Now we will see a crisis in the sugar industry to understand its seriousness. <sep><sep> Yesterday, Mauritians like Roukaya Kasenally were financed by them, and also by the "Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow", with a mention of Reagan. <sep><sep> We are looking at where there is overlapping: we are looking at the "extended continental shelf". <sep><sep> Felix made an application to close, (there, today he has not ruled out the last 2 assignments 2006 and 2007, the last time he ruled was in 2005). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As they grow older, their arguments become more radical, more reactionary. <sep> In their words, they are attacking the Best Loser system itself, as with the last election in 2005. <sep> On one side, it means a belief and culture of a group. <sep> But when we arrived here, in Mauritius, we relied on the boat. <sep> The plan they are implementing involves licensing, zeal and reducing salaries, privatizing essential services, much like the austerity measures imposed on us by the IMF / World Bank in the years 78 - 82. <sep> His father was a prominent figure in the community and on his boat, Ms. Grannkaz would come to the festival. <sep> Ram Seegobin spoke about launching this election and the two alliances being represented. <sep> When i hear people intervene since i came, there are some beautiful ideas. <sep> A State in which children are forced to learn in a "sub-tractive" way, it is a State capable of "linguistic genocide". <sep> They explained how the Inspector Ghoorah, who had seen them, had given them permission to serve Mr. Macque (better known as Biding), to bring a strong charge against them. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before we get into these mutations, we have a series of mutations in the strict class of manual workers, which is worth looking at. <sep><sep> And when the break is over after 15 minutes, we all start working together. <sep><sep> He started a job when he wanted to end. <sep><sep> It is the Best Loser system that influences political life in this country. <sep><sep> It means that you have more work, you have to do more work, more than 8 hours. <sep><sep> Since before, they were active in the strikes that were triggered in several regions of France. <sep><sep> - But the world is still full of uncertainty, Tantin Ganga. <sep><sep> And of course, it is the communal federation that is protesting against McDo, who has opened its doors, for anger, it. <sep><sep> The Israeli army has fired several shots at Gaza with helicopters, tanks, and other weapons provided by America and European countries. <sep><sep> 1

organized by WOSA, in which Neville Alexander was present. <sep> <sep> And this "growth" that the Sithanese are talking about is not bringing any benefits to the workers' lives. <sep> <sep> LALIT expresses its solidarity with three journalists, Gerard Cateaux, Josian Valere and Annabelle Volbert following the repression they are suffering from the State when they are practicing their profession. <sep> <sep> Valere's courageous work is strong, and the price of these products is too high. <sep> <sep> Remember how the Sithanen Finance Minister has resigned twice: the first time for "lack of solidarity in the government" to defend his liberalist budget. <sep> <sep> Untill he can withdraw his support for the sugar sector, because he has plans B, C, D all taken care of. <sep> <sep> The University of Mauritius has held an exam in Kreol language for the first time. <sep> <sep> Give 10 billion, another 25 billion, or if not, the government will have to nationalize the bank. <sep> <sep> PMSD cannot stand up when the Social Alliance, in connivance with the patronage against the same policy of destruction of jobs in the sugar industry that the MSM-MMM had started. <sep> <sep> We cannot agree on everything, but we advocate, we assert, as one, that our legal system is "correct", despite all its imperfections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And yet all the others who have someday or other had sons can have some like you, will be like you. <sep><sep> This is a bed we make in perpetuity, bringing a fight against patriarchy, against the patriarchal system which brings inequality. <sep><sep> and in this historical term that Darwin is using, and in the long term, a great many, as Malthus discovered. <sep><sep> Do we need specialized centers to take care of mental health or does it need to be integrated into dispensaries. <sep><sep> When developing Creole as a Foreign Language (for people from other countries), we found that with a lot of ease we do courses. <sep><sep> When they are advertising an increase in salaries, then the trade unions are forced to say that "the security industry, it's a case they have." <sep><sep> There were 3 members of the IWPS from the UK and 2 young workers from Tel Aviv together. <sep><sep> The struggle became public from the Labour Party Congress where Navin Ramgoolam made a long, long speech, which people heard on TV and live. <sep><sep> Often people talk about "the State" without ever explaining what it is. <sep><sep> We are in a situation where all the big cocks, big pro-capitalist economists have many problems. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The first course was conducted by Jean Claude Bibi, presided over by Cindy, on November 11, 2006, and was on the theme "The Difference in Political Courses in the Mauritius Revolution". <sep><sep> A political party, a revolutionary party like LALIT, is to understand the happening (through its history, movement in the present, and its future projections), that is, the trends in objective reality. <sep><sep> It is good, yes, but it is not necessarily to criticize the British State over the American State. <sep><sep> It started off on the right foot, as Mauritius challenged the nomination of the UK on the UN Security Council. <sep><sep> Furthermore, there is a confusion between languages and scripts. <sep><sep> The goal that I wish to convey to you all is not easy for me but I will try my best. <sep><sep> However, except in the case of Martine Desmarais (a specific case highlighted, hence "high profile"), NHRC didn't say that it could halt the activities of MCIT. <sep><sep> Thus it isn't surprising that when we look at L'Express, we find various discrepancies on the aspect of the environment and Kyoto, when there are British colonial remnants present. <sep><sep> And, at the same time, where the UK and the Anglophones in general, including Murdoch's newspapers, have exposed another weakness, a little confrontation. <sep><sep> In the case of the decriminalization of abortion, there is a dynamic towards women's emancipation. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And if the union is not just a goal in the social fabric of a capitalist system that fixes the price of work, fixes your exploitation, then the trade union can achieve 3 types of leeway: <sep><sep> In the bullpen, when you try to file a complaint against a policy for abuses, they refuse to take it now. <sep><sep> On the other hand, they ask for mass job creation, but the only thing it brings back is women in the formal production sector. <sep><sep> But it only answers money with CSR and integration of poor people. <sep><sep> The United States and Great Britain are still occupying Diego Garcia and the Chagos Islands illegally, as everyone knows, to guard their arsenal in the region. <sep><sep> Slaves need to be paid for working in the fields, in the factories, in the mansions of the boss, in the ranks of managers and supervisors. <sep><sep> For example, fishermen are blocking the road, Desbro workers are protesting, Levy's Dirty Cans are on strike, and small vendors are protesting. <sep><sep> Will America be able to renew the lease it has with the UK after 2016 for Diego? <sep><sep> All of them were on politics, and the last ones focused on the Biden government. <sep><sep> Once upon a time, a last boy, who was barely able to pass through the barbed wire, had the chance to see a weapons monitor and walk into another village where he had his friends before dawn. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, it is a rare and courageous event for anyone in Mauritius to volunteer and live in Palestine under military occupation. <sep> <sep> He explained that in Mauritius itself, during the time of the Dutch East India Company, all the people used to work for the company itself. <sep> <sep> There is no duty that has ended up becoming an inherent and fundamental problem: it is not possible to address the crisis in the Security Industry without considering the possibility of agricultural diversification. <sep> <sep> Thirdly, it will certainly integrate new members and sympathizers into the strict party. <sep> <sep> Along with the economic crisis, there is an ecological crisis that is increasingly threatening our planet. <sep> <sep> In LALIT, we know the ways in which Israel is imposing its dictatorship on the Palestinian people. <sep> <sep> This means that when we have recourse to the press, use press conferences, issue press releases, do interviews when journalists ask, etc., we can count on press coverage, but it is risky. <sep> <sep> Somehow, he felt that the amount of his conversations was cracking. <sep> <sep> So, the IMF and the Central Bank of Europe are imposing the same "regime" on the Greeks that they imposed 30-40 years ago on all the Tyermond countries when they fall into debt. <sep> <sep> So, we are making a peaceful demonstration in front of the British Embassy in Port Louis in sign of protest. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the government seems to have begun to realize the seriousness of the problem of the laws. <sep><sep> So, in a great measure, when I take stock of LALIT, I am amazed at the spirit and vitality of our party in terms of individual militants, as individuals. <sep><sep> In the security industry, things are starting to happen to get licenses. <sep><sep> When we look at LALIT's political strategy, it depends on the degree of mobilization and unity in the working class. <sep><sep> He followed the course and learned how to start a website, understand open source software and a series of other things. <sep><sep> The government does not have time for a serious plan to combat chronic omaz situation. <sep><sep> The water was low and it gave them a feeling of well-being as they returned to their mother's womb. <sep><sep> Medine, for example, has been severely affected, and others are too. <sep><sep> And our latest program was on Alternative Economic Policy. <sep><sep> This second slogan, distilled from a strategy, from a principle, favors the boss. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite the great economic crisis, in any case, it follows technological development. <sep><sep> But, in the different context, is it not a delay in the process where the buzzword in a social revolution in Mauritius? <sep><sep> They have shared, on the battlefield against the base in Japan and against Diego Garcia, and on the NO BASES network. <sep><sep> Among them is Arnaud Carpooran who not only made the first Creole dictionary (in Creole), but he was interested in the  studies of young people at the University of Mauritius in this effort to promote the Creole language. <sep><sep> This is because it is raising the stature of the Mauritian Creole language. <sep><sep> But when they do this, they are effectively consolidating the economic base of the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> and it shows all of us, in front of our eyes, that it sends him for a walk (we must talk nicely), walk all the international laws that respect everyone, and send even Mr. United Nations for a walk. <sep><sep> The development of this new language territory is changing the power relations in favor of the Creole language relative to other languages that have been established in state institutions for a long time. <sep><sep> The global financial crisis in 2007, when many banks went bankrupt, followed by the oil and food crisis, aggravated the economic situation in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Hannah and I went to Checkpoint Beit Amin for a follow-up visit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He did not say if he had ever followed the right path, and unfortunately, he encountered difficulties and finally failed. <sep><sep> In the Constitution for a deputy, one must know how to speak and write a foreign language, preferably English. <sep><sep> Secondly, the Mauritian State must have a 3/4 majority if it intends to amend the Constitution to get out of the situation in which it finds itself. <sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna have not found anyone asking for help. <sep><sep> The quality of education that Carol Benson advocates is not new. <sep><sep> So, when we look back (like we had sent Comrade Rada to do in the previous article just before the end of the year, and he did it in a fantastic way). <sep><sep> After 15 minutes there, two soldiers on patrol come to me and say that I do not have the right to cross here because my name does not appear on the list that he received from his superior, Captain Rafi. <sep><sep> In Parsyel Flak, it is Mrs. Dulloo who ran for the MMM against Aneerood Jugnauth. <sep><sep> In politics, the Workers' Government continues with new popular measures, such as new policies to allow property less than 2 acres and a half to be sold without permission and without tax. <sep><sep> We were swimming in the lake and it took almost 30 minutes before we finished passing control. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen has identified the difference between a struggle and a degrowth movement, and she defines this moment as when all workers stop working, then the working class becomes a class. <sep><sep> A set of measures in the Labor Act to protect full security, including severe allowances. <sep><sep> Whether one is unemployed, a child, a student, a teacher, everyone is affected by this crisis. <sep><sep> And in Creole, we have a nice expression for this thing that we sell. <sep><sep> In the past, an industry that used all good agricultural land, produced a lot of employment, and even a lot of capital itself. <sep><sep> Performance Original Morso Music composed by Rajni Lallah (electric piano) together with vocalist Joelle Hosseny: The Sea.

Duval in particular during his term as a lawyer in England, to recover the PMSD lumpen electorate and create the MR. Meanwhile, there is internal turmoil within the PMSD to determine who will retain the paternity of the PMSD. <sep> <sep> We can also say that in every aspect of State affairs, it has its own history where the bedrock of the class struggle has emerged. <sep> <sep> The Trade Union Common Platform (TUCP) and the Front Syndical de Gos (FSG) demonstrated on Tuesday the 5th of October, the day when Minister Bunwaree presented a new draft law that will make working conditions more difficult. <sep> <sep> Last Wednesday, a delegation from the LALIT party appeared before the Select Committee on EVM. <sep> <sep> And where all its cooperative production has been decimated, and capitalism has been beautifully and wisely installed. <sep> <sep> So, likewise in 1978, another grade of the Pakistani military, Zia-ul-Haq, who had trained militarily in Zini, the military staged a coup against him and shot him as President. <sep> <sep> The Minister of Health and the Minister of Family Rights, have effectively established the formal RAPE CRISIS UNIT, in JEETOO and in CANDOS. <sep> <sep> They have made every effort to silence all means to shut up Lalit. <sep> <sep> A real unit, it becomes amusing or cruel to act out a program, a claim program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This mobilization is necessary not only during election time but it needs to be done in a permanent way. <sep><sep> For example, Rajni Lallah, Rada Kistnasamy, Ram Seegobin (because this anger was already marked as Ashok Subron had announced another meeting that was already fixed). <sep><sep> And in our Conference, besides speakers that we’ve already welcomed, we also have a LALIT speaker, which one by one will take the floor. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, MMM and the media have been facing MedPoint problems due to a battle involving MSM (particularly Pravind Jugnauth and Maya Hanoomanjee), in order to place more responsibility directly on Navin Ramgoolam’s head. <sep><sep> So, this 35-year work, its addition and its multiplication, is a work that has an accumulation of wisdom. <sep><sep> We are pleased to publish the first track listing for all visitors to the website. <sep><sep>• Finished with a system that no longer has its reason to exist when it has PR and 4 deputies per constituency. <sep><sep> As a family, to support it during an oath that it will have to face. <sep><sep> Everyone agreed that a small intimate marriage was necessary. <sep><sep> He was active in the "Communist Workers and Peasants Party". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, it's good that he considers it a lack of morality, even a taboo to ask, "Is your language inferior to mine?". <sep><sep> Where the Commission's union, there were comparisons in different sectors: Construction, Public health, BPO, teaching, inter-parliamentary debates show the difficulties in different sectors. <sep><sep> What is causing this serious political instability. <sep><sep> Take advantage, be cautious to prevent us from getting caught. <sep><sep> But, the establishment has a monopoly on the land, a monopoly on capital, so it has a duty to create jobs for the people of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Also, because our political office is on a rotational basis, you also have the possibility to discuss within the Lalit party, as a spokesperson, if you are on the Central Committee, depending on who knows more about the dossier. <sep><sep> As you will notice, we have a variety of old classics, documentaries, and big movies that are not seen in commercial cinemas. <sep><sep> You can't settle it by drinking Red Bull, or Prozac, it won't be reduced if you read a good book, no. <sep><sep> In this campaign, we will oppose all kinds of development that are in the interest of profit, hindering people's progress. <sep><sep> He knew that sometimes the juggler had lost his balance, but most of the time until he found reason to gain the trust of his audience. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, it seems that the general elections will take place between the 6th and 11th of September, with Nomination Day following on the 11th. <sep><sep> Also, there is a series of artists who have agreed to participate, which will lead to a deeper reflection in the Conference (See the list below). <sep><sep> Firstly, Ram Seegobin mentioned that there are a number of strange things in that report. <sep><sep> For bombing ice, for distributing seawater, for carrying icebergs. <sep><sep> While, the sick, workers may take sick leave when they are unwell. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin mentioned that the question being asked is who will be responsible for this diversification? <sep><sep> The British Constitution and the British State, when its interest is at stake, can say, "What the Court has said, but it does not correspond to our interest. That's the limitation of this legalistic strategy. <sep><sep> LALIT campaign is based on demands that respond to the general interests of the working class and also to the interests of other oppressed social groups (small traders, small farmers, fishermen, women). <sep><sep> Samy was in his place but Tamby pointed out to his comrades that they could find him by calling him a broad market. <sep><sep> Everyone agrees that the torture going on in another military base where it is illegally occupied, Guantanamo in Cuba is wrong. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This news item was the subject of a report in the newspaper L’Express about how the police, who are acting as the law, sought to block a member of Lalit who was supposed to attend this meeting at the Social Security Office at St Georges Street to discuss how to stop PA BUSH. <sep><sep> Here the members of Lalit and MLF spent the night together on strike. <sep><sep> IPP is selling drugs with CEB at a guaranteed price. <sep><sep> This Sart file was developed by the Ministry of Food Security, initiated by Lalit and a dozen other organizations. <sep><sep> After the CPE, when the results are announced, each primary school will receive its first allocation. <sep><sep> Jenito Seedoo (MMM) said that MMM believes that Ashock Jugnauth is better placed to win the by-election! <sep><sep> This second component of the "social" work is clearly a departure from the political elite, but also raises economic system questions. <sep><sep> When you observe their behavior, it falls every year, despite all the "resilience" the Minister of Finance talks about, and despite his supposed "progress". <sep><sep> And when you feel a downturn, now there is potential for an upturn in the lower class society, we feel it's a time where we must stick together. <sep><sep> This is a crisis that was not resolved during the recession of 2006 and 2007. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>On September 2nd - In the context of the presidential elections in Lebanon, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution initiated by the United States and seconded by France: <sep><sep>It is interesting that if a union is going to declare a strike in a sector, it must conduct a secret ballot. <sep><sep>LALIT hopes that the Government encourages all kinds of press - whether it is the level at which it pays for its advertising or the subscriptions it undertakes. <sep><sep>And this is something, as in our program, that is within our reach. <sep><sep>So you can also participate in democracy in our country, at all levels where it exists, and even participate in LALIT for more democracy. <sep><sep>The working class is simply someone who earns a salary every month/every fortnight/every day from work, or sells their labor or physical or mental effort in exchange for work, which means almost everyone in modern society; what the Occupy movement calls the "99%". <sep><sep>We make a formal demand for the Government to publish the fees: <sep><sep>Even if prices are determined in the market based on supply and demand, okay, but its general level must also be close to its "value", and that "value". <sep><sep>Then after 150 years, that is almost 100 years later, we had the first major crisis that took on a truly global form; <sep><sep>India's nuclear bomb became a powerful torch through its army. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The LALIT is presenting its candidate for this by-election because we respect the democratic right that the electorate has to vote for a replacement for a deputy who has resigned. <sep><sep> - The only necessary political action since the fall of the government is for everyone to go vote. <sep><sep> After the police put charges, like Ram Seegobin was lucky to be called "listener", and Lindsey Collen was lucky to be called "mute". <sep><sep> When the Mauritian Government invites a President Bush who has been involved in financing in such a way, surely covers up the fact that they themselves were elected with money from Rogers and Air Mauritius. <sep><sep> Therefore, the union assures that workers who remain benefit a little from this compression. <sep><sep> With the dismissal of many family heads in the textile industry and with establishments laying off workers, families severely affected by poverty and job insecurity. <sep><sep> In 'These hotels that scare ...' Thierry Château talks about environmental concerns. <sep><sep> After 100 days, the new Alliance Government for the Future discovered that there is a very serious economic crisis in Europe, which will have catastrophic consequences for Mauritius. <sep><sep> Even Dharam Raj was forced to admit that discrimination was rampant everywhere and that the major victims were Afro-Kreoles. <sep><sep> What is interesting in this context, the purpose of the union lalit is for better conditions and better peace. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>When the family was preparing to vote for the first time, there was a condition: in order to have the right to vote, you had to know how to write your name. <sep><sep>They showed us a photo of the Revolutionary Brigade: a large group of militants from Australia, South Africa, and Mauritius. <sep><sep>(Marxist-Leninists, Maoists, Lagos Kalkist Quranists and also Lagos Parcham Quranists, former PDPA - Marxist party). <sep><sep>And the Workers' Party, it must come forward in our agenda, because the Workers' Party, it is an excellent event, international. <sep><sep>And up to the last moment before the elections, the press had even noted (and it's a fact) that there was a "swing" taking place among the elected officials towards the direction of the Workers' Party, in particular, and towards the Social Alliance in general. <sep><sep>It has arranged its foreign policy to economically favor its class. <sep><sep>According to a report from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) for the week of 22 to 28 November, the Israeli army was responsible for the death of 11 Palestinians, 28 injured, and 42 people kidnapped. <sep><sep>If people mobilize around these demands, we can see that the government, being capitalist, will also take some measures. <sep><sep>The manners supporting it came from Jacques de Navacelle, former President of FME, Ariff Currimjee, a big capitalist and former President of JEC, and presence before business people Joel Toussaint. <sep><sep>*Where Raddhoa was a special symbol of this impiety: before he died, he found himself totally paralyzed in a corner. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here follows the translation of the passage provided above. <sep><sep> Or there is something that everyone has, but it is not enough, so he also transfers it to God. <sep><sep> Kate called Shelly in Israel for her to call the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and the police to ask if there had been arrests. <sep><sep> Initially, the doctor believed that she was suffering from the inevitable consequences of menopause. <sep><sep> In Havana, it is extremely green with these Irbin Gardens. <sep><sep> And what is planted in the earth should grow, and that all Mauritians should put their hands in the earth's soil. <sep><sep> This analysis prevented us from falling into the trap of superficial and cosmetic analysis. <sep><sep> SILU and UASI recognition were blocked, even though they were the strongest unions in this industry, because the Labour Government was protecting its unions. <sep><sep> There is a problem because the equality between political rights masks another reality. <sep><sep> But today, with this serious economic crisis of the capitalist system, it is necessary that we continue our mobilization towards a program for an alternative economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To live differently in a dawn of their of life. <sep><sep> Government in all these countries can no longer refund their debt that it owe to their country or international bank. <sep><sep>   and where it has already done all this job, including poets, including ordained people, who have continued to promote and use written Creole language and in a basic spelling and that since the 70s. <sep><sep> There's a recruitment possibility, as we have started to realize, for the distribution of the Review. <sep><sep> Today the Challenge is among all the activists, it is how they reported the experiences that the children are experiencing today in Palestine. <sep><sep> Like this, they can solve problems such as transport- ation, shift, transfer. <sep><sep> It is located in the village of Deir Istiya and it has a school. <sep><sep> But all this did not prevent it from standing out in the Bolema Holding hierarchy until it became the number one in Lasos and Lasos Co. Lmt. <sep><sep> And, in that case, we need to note that, even if before the election the Labour Party and its bloc suddenly got into conflict with the established representatives (at that time politically represented by PMSD), almost all the 50 years in power of Labour ended up forming a coalition with PMSD. <sep><sep> If appropriate, LALIT program elements, that is, if it is a democratic trade union, LALIT will be a minority until a pre-revolutionary time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MMM/MSM alliance has gone through a period of instability. <sep><sep> However, it is important to note that this variability is relative. <sep><sep> I believe that what has happened in the last 25 years is a transformational ultra-liberal philosophy, meaning that the union's role has decreased significantly. <sep><sep> In the Ganga Valley, life was bitter and a good number of Gangawa accepted to seek a better life in another country instead of eating bitter gourd. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is also more creativity, and this is what brings these 3 elements together. <sep><sep> It then becomes possible to imagine another form of collective work organization on the work site. <sep><sep> Finally, in October, Berenger realizes that he is in a mess, so he withdraws all his proposals. <sep><sep> It is good that the CEB is planning 3 wind turbines in Trefles, Rodrigues. <sep><sep> This means that it is not just limited to those who buy our magazine, no. <sep><sep> What we have gained in the transport industry has fallen exactly between these two. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, a colonial state, a colonial administration, which imposes itself. <sep> <sep> "And finally, I will give LALIT's comments on this crisis." <sep> <sep> They don't necessarily use this power today, but it is there. <sep> <sep> How does this knowledge help us in our political work? <sep> <sep> One is May 75, the great student mobilization, and the other is the great strike, the labor movement, Ut '79 which rekindles one after, in September 80. <sep> <sep> The last 2-3 years have been dominated by certain themes like Air Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Finally, the development of this program has been done in a more democratic way than other political development programs: all ministers were integrated. <sep> <sep> but in the press, there is only one, Le Matinal, which has announced that this event will take place. <sep> <sep> They had handed out the Larenion flag (red-green-blue horizontal stripes with a small star in the blue) and a newsletter http://www.lorenione.info/ which has supported lalit GRC since 2000. <sep> <sep> One Friday night, Princess Prathna told her husband and their eleven children that she was happy they were together for dinner. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We met a taxi driver who told us that last year he lost his brother. <sep><sep> At this point, we need to create hope and see something positive from this. <sep><sep> It was preferable for the nation to take its destiny into its own hands. <sep><sep> We need to discuss the political situation, especially the events of 2012. <sep><sep> Everyone has the right to choose how they want to become. <sep><sep> Both of them did not want to make the same mistake as their parents. <sep><sep> Customers at Misie Jabaljas were complaining because the wood he was supplying them with was of poor quality. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we are taking action based on our program: <sep><sep> We brought cash into the Alliance for the Future and MSM left the Government. <sep><sep> Since 2005, we have been warning about the systemic crisis triggered by the high cost of guarantees and the uncertain future of the textile market. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The current crisis is becoming exposed in concrete terms and the way a bourgeoisie operates in detail. <sep><sep> At that time, there were many plantations intermingled with the land of the settlement. <sep><sep> It is serious because its existence depends on something "total." <sep><sep> We were just beside where there are 8 families living in poverty. <sep><sep> Each one has developed a little strength and ability to reproduce elites. <sep><sep> For a 40-hour week for artisans, 5 days for workers, not to form unions; they are not the ones that have been created by the movement, not too much known on which side. <sep><sep> It is a policy of honesty and only on which the different newspapers of departments and para-state decide to subscribe, it is a policy of rights for all the press to participate in all press conferences and other official events. <sep><sep> The paper we sent had the title: "The Struggle for Socialism in Mauritius". <sep><sep> Militants LALIT Roland Fozoo and Devianand Narrain who were charged in February, had explained how in March 2002. <sep><sep> PPP, the latest form of privatization that is rampant in many capitalist countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the time of PMSD representing the interests of the historical bourgeoisie had already confirmed this stance. <sep><sep> together with ultra-liberal philosophies that the Report Lim and TULRA-NPPC represented: <sep><sep> Minister Boolell also made a call for what he called a "national solidarity platform" on the issue of the Chagos where all political and social forces unite on the question of Chagos and give this issue a regional and international dimension. <sep><sep> After 40 years, finally, a profound artistic creation for an official celebration. <sep><sep> It didn't go according to the system because, as President Obama knows well, Israel always acts like a law-abiding state, which has never followed either the UN, Europe, or the international community, precisely because they have the backing of the US state that acts as a shield in their military aggression. <sep><sep> No inhabitant has the time to take down license plate numbers of military vehicles. <sep><sep> So, this can represent significant elements in the development of the bourgeoisie of the state on this Workers' Island kingdom. <sep><sep> We are fighting against repression, against violence by state officials. <sep><sep> Aneerood Jugnauth has been in conflict with Ramgoolam and other trade union leaders since the moment the MSM resigns. <sep><sep> Benjamin Moutou (LUC) in the Federation says he is a Francophone and he is against the Creole language if when promoting the Creole language he is also taking care of some spaces of the French language. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a second challenge, called the "New Deal" in the United States (1932-39) after the Great Economic Depression of 1929, when capitalism was collapsing in the United States. <sep> Today, we are going to discuss some of them; We are proposing to start a green sector in the tourism industry, for local commercialization and especially for export. <sep> How can the Mauritius Government launch a beautiful campaign for a Sustainable Maurice Islands (naturally including all the islands in the country in the name of this governmental organism) when at the same time on our proposed territory there are uranium and nickel stocks? <sep> How will he work his mind to understand what he can do in such a situation? <sep> In a transitional program, as we advocate in LALIT, there is a central element. <sep> SC and HSC Examination Fees now "means tested" too. <sep> And he goes further when he gives Paloma and her mother a television so they can follow the television stars on which they base their lives. <sep> When Paul Bérenger in opposition, whether in 1984, 1987, 2005, he always manages to lead the union, when, for example he brings the union back to a pro-boss point of view. <sep> How many people in the world today have the freedom to have American military bases to use for launching planes to bomb them in the future? <sep> This means that it is possible to have a debate on its content. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In branches and regions, we follow a classic routine. <sep><sep> – Plenty of people have worked on dictionary work as well as on spelling: V. Hookoomsing, A. Carpooran, P. <sep><sep> – Manann, it's time for you to go to bed, my dear! The guests are leaving. <sep><sep> This is played in favor of Pravind Jugnauth, when he's Prime Minister today. <sep><sep> 80% of people say, "We agree to exploit ourselves, continue to exploit ourselves." <sep><sep> It is the same person who comes to check if there are illegal nuclear matters. <sep><sep> Like when there was more profitability in the Textile Industry, the unions were involved in reducing wages. <sep><sep> Except for Elizier Francois, everyone understands why Lalit launches tirazosor. <sep><sep> In our history, there is a report by great experts, by great professors who show that there is no reason for any logic to give priority to good arable land and plant only sugar cane on it. <sep><sep> Frankly, let's look at one of the punishments in Capital in Mauritius that has brought this current instability. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Evolution of the concept of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace in 1971: The Zini Nation adopted a modified version of the resolution that the Non-Aligned Movement had presented on the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. <sep><sep> In everyday language, people refer to "authorities" which include all that the State is, from its leader to its branch in the family. <sep><sep> What kind of State allows it to embody a nation to that extent. <sep><sep> A possible chase against Pravind Jugnauth, S. Dowarkasing, M.Hanoomanjee. <sep><sep> And it is at the same time that the Government stopped its subsidies on rice and flour. <sep><sep> But in a country of rights, all people, including those accused of crimes, have fundamental rights. <sep><sep> And today in a way, the problem, it is still there. <sep><sep> where people shared experiences of strategies and tactics that have already been tested- it is to see whether it is possible to use the same strategies and tactics in different cases. <sep><sep> You may doubt, you may not be reasoned, but if you have a million, a package of respect you gain. <sep><sep> However, this rake only arrived just after the Prime Minister was elected in Gaza, Ismael Haniyeh made an appeal for a truce period with Israel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the election campaign, our program had a strong point in our campaign. <sep> <sep> So, this government is introducing electoral reform ahead of this by-election. <sep> <sep> This year, there is a season of heavy rain in Europe, America, so the demand is high. <sep>  <sep> He needs to wake up early in the morning to sell his products. <sep> <sep> It is an article from LALIT, not an article from LPT, in L'Express that challenges Creole language, and that's how it should be. <sep> <sep> The Road Map also includes proposals to increase revenue in the sugar industry through ethanol production, and by increasing electricity production from bagasse. <sep> <sep> So, another like Lindsey Collen, with a post-modern style, has an extraordinary sense for writing and reading in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> * When and where are we scheduling appointments to carry out all these things? <sep> <sep> Disability education in Mauritius has only received a subsidy of Rs 17 million in its budget, but the Finance Minister Jugnauth has Rs 20 million to spend on roads in Port Louis, like a "Big Brother". <sep> <sep> We hope that this 5th competition will once again provide an opportunity to encourage literary creation in Mauritian Creole with new poems, plays, stories, novels, and translations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That's how you start again! You need me, I'll make sure to come to you so that there is no need for you to trouble yourself. <sep><sep> This is why representatives of 23 different villages in Lesid (representing village councils, groups in villages, and village associations) are present. <sep><sep> Today, when Roland Fozoo went to the Intermediate Court of Port Louis to Zizman, the Magistrate postponed Zizman for Friday, the 7th of December, at 1 p.m. <sep><sep> Therefore, the bourgeoisie would have to have another party, a replacement or a stooge to represent them politically, as the PT and PMSD continue to decline. <sep><sep> He said that the allegations he fought, that he just invented them by lawyers, sometimes he mentions it by a lawyer in general, sometimes he names 5-6 by their name, and he even threatens to sue them or report them. <sep><sep> Ram has also put emphasis on the fact that LALIT has worked a lot on the revitalization of our PROGRAM on a certain number of topics. <sep><sep> The theme of the speech was "Securing a transition from trade preferences to global competition". <sep><sep> There are signs that the government is going to rely on what Minister Boolell said in forums. <sep><sep> Because it was not predictable that Ashok Subron would act as a trade union leader next to Sadien, next to Imrith, next to trade union officials like this, then he would run with Lalit. <sep><sep> It also raises awareness to help families that have mentally handicapped mothers and mental health problems that are very difficult to handle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The tactic of this trade union grouping was meant to put MMM and MSM in a public position against these two laws, before discussing it in Parliament last Monday. <sep> <sep> Linguistic genocide is when the State forces children to abandon their parents' language, for example through language policies in schools, or when it imposes mental distress on all children who speak a particular language. <sep> <sep> But together, without any distinction with Mauritians, <sep> <sep> They were not making any major land reforms, and other progressive reforms. <sep> <sep> This is serious, especially in a period of high food prices, oil crisis, and recession on the horizon for the Chinese and European states. <sep> <sep> During this time Timi felt the need for an association to address the issues of women but had to pay attention not to antagonize men. <sep> <sep> To what extent have they strayed from ethics, and perhaps even engage in self-criticism. <sep> <sep> There was a minority who thought there should be a new civilization based on respect and sharing. <sep> <sep> TUTF has a Committee, where there are officials and trade unionists. <sep> <sep> LALIT places great importance on the fact that each Member of Parliament must be accountable to the electorate in a constituency. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> I received the following Mauritian Creole data as input:

<sep> What LALIT have asked me to do - but first good morning to all present comrades - is to tell a few stories. <sep><sep> He believes he can go have a drink with Bush, reassure him that the Mauritian State agrees with its military base on Diego, then go ask Blair for sovereignty. <sep><sep> In face of the worsening drug problem affecting families more, the MSM-MMM government and the Labour government and its Social Alliance currently propose microcredit. <sep><sep> For LALIT there was a Leadership Commission for LALIT Education, with three Commission members, Cindy Clelie, Ally Hosenbokus, Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> If we take as an example a deputy who was elected in 1982, 9 months after the government broke and was re-elected in 1983 until the 1987 election, that is to say, he completed his 2 terms within 5 years and qualifies for the pension. <sep><sep> Both LALIT delegates agreed that it was quite an amusing experience. <sep><sep> Now, technically, there was supposed to be border control, and people were not supposed to enter Israel without their passport/ID. <sep><sep> Monday, everyone knows, it's a workday, so there's no International Conference. <sep><sep> That's true between his lines, between his candles. <sep><sep> On Saturday 8 November, Lindsey Collen led a session that was very realistic on the financial crisis and economic crisis.

I have translated it into English for you. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In our countryside, we have organized a demonstration against the military base of Diego Garcia and against the decision of British government to declare a Protected Maritime Zone as part of a territory under an illegal occupation. <sep><sep> Present for Lalit: Alain Ah Vee (President), Lindsey Collen, Ram Seegobin, Rada Kistnasamy, Roland Boussac, Yannick Jeanne. <sep><sep> There is a God up there, a time for us, a time for peace, a time for animals, in the lord of importance. <sep><sep> Besides marginal ideas like SMEs, the Government and the Opposition have not made any proposals on what needs to be done for employment, namely to serve the people in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> So the Central Bank has floated 100 million dollars in the bank. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen on behalf of LALIT spoke about the need to mobilize behind a strategy to oppose the military base on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> There are already pilot projects in Rodrigues and Mauritius, but they are marginal, facing vested interests that we have shown. <sep><sep> Without any fanfare, it squeezed between obstacles, rocks, barriers, and fences to reach where it wanted to go according to its plan. <sep><sep> But, long ago they realized that they needed to organize while bands of associations. <sep><sep> In recent years they have lived by investing capital, buying labor forces, by the dozen, hundreds, thousands of workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often in the form of a little oversight, what can happen? <sep> <sep> This mobilization for 3 days, led by Chagossians, has brought about a deeper sanction than affects the daily lives of the Chagossian people today, which affects the possible reintegration of Mauritius as a whole today. <sep> <sep> But its history has been marked by various extreme right-wing currents that have not completely disappeared and can resurface, especially in an economic crisis context. <sep> <sep> At a press conference yesterday, LALIT presented Rada Kistnasamy as a candidate in the Partial Election to be held on 1 March in constituency number 8. <sep> <sep> This was a surprise move at that time, and it continues to surprise until now. <sep> <sep> LALIT is the only party that has been consistent, has continued to work on mobilization so that there can be an economic development that is in the interest of all people who work to live and impoverished people. <sep> <sep> As a result, the outdated LPT offset camera, a mime machine, has become obsolete. <sep> <sep> Many people will surely remember campaigns from the 80s against the Outspan orange brand. <sep> <sep> Sami had given up watching his football match. <sep> <sep> The state and employers have used this capital, with the blessing or silence of the trade union movement, to legally and expressly lay off employees (through Blue-print and VRS payments) rather than create jobs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this conference, 5 Resolutions called "Great River Declaration" were voted and finally accepted by the government. 
<sep> Structural Crisis in Mauritius (systemic crisis), strengthening the economy in the same time in the security and tourism industry, French territories:
<sep> Others have been arrested, disappeared, executed without trial, or committed suicide in their cells. <sep> There are 522,000 Palestinians separated from their land, hundreds of homes have been destroyed and artillery is demolishing more than 100,000 trees, of which 83,000 are olive trees. <sep> There is already a wind farm project with the government of Lenin. <sep> If one ever finds oneself to be starving for a sandwich, one has the right to finish it, cover it, and then rest. <sep> LALIT has a program to establish a mechanism that will bring more equality in schools and colleges, and also at the level of tertiary education. <sep> But they are getting a price that only 1/3 of what the European producers get, because there are subsidies on beet sugar and this is "illegal" according to the WTO regulations, because Europe is also selling part of its surplus on the world market. <sep> If we do not commit ourselves, we will lose the advantage. <sep> The main economic sector that is closing is in the countryside. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The introduction of the mother tongue as a medium and the necessary introduction of content and pedagogy, because all parents are becoming obsessed with and competing at the CPE level. <sep>
 <sep> A program that takes into account the levels of consciousness among workers at a given moment and places an emphasis on listing and placing this in history, and ways to act on the basis of demand that creates dynamic without revolutionary sanctions. <sep>
 <sep> In the conference on Tuesday, March 28, the Education for Workers launched a "Language and Literacy Consultancy Unit" that will offer services. <sep>
 <sep> Tensions have increased between Israel and Palestine, due to the recent political developments in Israel. <sep>
 <sep> Balram discovered that his family was in reflection, and slowly he saw it, placing his hand on his head. <sep>
 <sep> Wilbert van der Zeijden, who coordinated the international network in LALIT, member of NO BASES. <sep>
 <sep> Today, we note a new extreme penetration of the USA in Mauritian society, where the ambassador has been granted funding from Yes You(th) Can, the family association and other organizations. <sep>
 <sep> It was a program that stirred up a lot of Morisyanism, especially in the first part to popularise the term. <sep>
 <sep> In the last 10 years, there have been 45,000 abandoned hectares of land. <sep>
 <sep> This is according to another law called the Employment Relations Act that has two clauses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today we will not be able to take the bus or the checkpoint. <sep><sep> Since December 2010, the situation at the Israel-Gaza border has been deteriorating. <sep><sep> He will try to rather invest in the IRS or develop a large hotel on the coast. <sep><sep> But the motion goes further, and proposes in a second part that Ashok Subron can act "in any function in the name of GWF". <sep><sep> Those who were happy to chat were even saying that when he went to a family gathering, he dressed like a family member. <sep><sep> Women for Life are also active in the movement against occupation. <sep><sep> And only when they write articles together, it is a movement that starts from the bottom in an organized and relatively controlled manner. <sep><sep> LALIT had a case against Agalega by one of its members who had returned from there for 6 months. <sep><sep> So, in general, expenses should be reduced, and it is likely to reduce its military expenses, where more than a third of its bases are on foreign soil. <sep><sep> "We are witnessing a communal polarization in this debate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economic crises have been occurring since Marx, and even before Marx, since Ricardo and Adam Smith, they have found that the "price" can be determined by supply and demand. <sep><sep> In conclusion, LALIT would have been glad to attract attention to the first paragraph of our commentary last year, as we were predicting the "Kamajeet Strike", which the commentators have not yet taken up. <sep><sep> It also seems that the ICJ is beginning to have an impact in Israel (following some articles from the TO). <sep><sep> While for 20 years, there are reasonable criticisms that successful DPPs are not independent enough. <sep><sep> This will create a dynamic that raises the level of education further in all schools. <sep><sep> And it's these realities that we often do not want to find that, according to her, Lindsey Collen puts forward in her books; novels that are not only for pleasure but to raise critical questions. <sep><sep> Restructuring the sugar industry will likely bring significant sanctions in relation to different classes with conflicting interests. <sep><sep> In addition to this, it conflicts with GWF [General Workers Federation] which is rising in labor, transport, CEB [Central Electricity Board], CWA [Central Water Authority], the sugar industry. <sep><sep> And this reality obliges workers to mobilize. <sep><sep> * Allows employers to pay less than the minimum wage stipulated in the Collective Agreement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, initially we continue this illusion that there is a position in Parliament. <sep><sep> A politician who unifies all the aspects in a way that we understand how. <sep><sep> The session ended at 10 p.m. and everyone present left with a copy of Roger Moss' book, published by LPT. <sep><sep> In another way, so, we come back to the starting point. <sep><sep> So he attacks Minister MSM Maya Hanoomanjee today, today, attacking Maya Hanoomanjee as if he were the only one in government, the world will be perfect. <sep><sep> * The military base on this country's target is disintegrating. <sep><sep> Among the people Kamomia had a man who used his business acumen to amass a fortune of immeasurable wealth. <sep><sep> The capitalist class, he resists, he, because he wants to acquire a larger share of what is produced, in the form of profit. <sep><sep> A committee meeting at Monper in Bambous has succeeded in digging a hole as far as 90 meters away from the Monper residence. <sep><sep> We find it difficult to understand why the Mauritian Government is receiving American President Moris. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, secondly, and lastly, the most important thing is to ensure that workers participate in all decisions, democratically. <sep><sep> This means that for a session where there is a speech in English, for those who prefer to listen in Creole, what is said in English will be translated here, where reception is better. <sep><sep> Gramsci explains how the bourgeoisie, being a minority class in the capitalist system, maintains power only through a dense "compromise platform" with the aims of the other classes, forming a political process, and calling the entirety of this "organism" holding the power a "historical bloc." <sep><sep> Following a question in a press conference, Ashok Subron specified that Lalit is firmly opposed to the policies of the MSM-MMM government, not a question of voting for it. <sep><sep> 42% of workers work for subcontractors, meaning that 80% of small companies will close after 3-4 years of existence. <sep><sep> Energy from wind and the sea gives us a connection with the sea, we have the potential resources between the waves, as well as the movement of the sea to produce energy. <sep><sep>A National Assembly and proportional representation through the list to avoid the need to classify the population through a new census. <sep><sep> Thus, youth in LALIT have influence on branches, membership assembly, central committees, and even on the political bureau as the BP members rotate. <sep><sep> What are the consequences of this absence at the level of the MMM, the Remake, and also at the political level in general? <sep><sep> Recently from Kanya College in Johannesburg, Lehulere, invited Lalit, discussed "how the working class determines its program and strategy in times of economic crisis." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and what it has become is starting to enter the entrance where you can say control the Labor Party by Group Advance. <sep><sep> It is this very force, two for survival in small things that allows people to survive today and continue to believe that one day the occupation will end. <sep><sep> - Tentative Timmy, we will look at this when his time comes. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam is sharing dairy wealth with big planters, with new rice in commerce, tourism, finance and industrial production. <sep><sep> But MMM had a class analysis that certainly couldn't explain its own political positioning. <sep><sep> Britain then, with the U.S.A's collusion, went ahead, shooting all the Mauritian Sagos carrying wasps who had fought back, as well as some Seychellois. <sep><sep> When it was announced that the process of amending these 2 laws was ongoing, then GWF/JNP quickly organized a demonstration and after their arrest program, declared that they had won a "victory". <sep><sep> MMM will no longer take a place in this class conflict, this class struggle that is so intense. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, over time, there are more and more ideas "adapt or perish"; this slogan that is becoming more "marketable" today in the world, even in big trade union forums. <sep><sep> When it comes to what needs to be a better matrimonial law for all citizens. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, if there is a government that reflects the interests of the people, we have no problem if it is a single government for the entire world. <sep> <sep> So when all the candidates of Lalit reign on Tuesday, we took action against this corrupt colonial system. <sep> <sep> The presence of the base itself brings up other problems. <sep> <sep> So, when Ramesh formed LALIT together with other founding members, here is what he contributed. <sep> <sep> And this year, it is integrated into the organized society. <sep> <sep> How sure are we that the women in these bourgeois parties are limited to defending the programs that the men in the party have decided and where there is no place for demands concerning women's lives? <sep> <sep> Both commemorative coins celebrate two territories that England is illegally occupying. <sep> <sep> This new interest will invade Africa, especially because there is a large proportion of rare metals and a sufficient stock of good oil, underground in Africa. <sep> <sep> However, if he gains control of the Joint Panel, it becomes so strong that he can force SILU to come to terms with him. <sep> <sep> PSUVJ militants have explained that youth are one of the main pillars of the Revolution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In NRB's sofa, in the past, there was no need for a union, workers used to go and deposit by themselves. <sep><sep> So, to answer the question, neither LALIT knows what it is, nor has anyone asked if we want to be part of it. <sep><sep> But, until many people refuse to face the crisis head-on. <sep><sep> And if there is any dispute, then it will be the Supreme Court that will come to make this ethno-religious classification. <sep><sep> But what they don't say is that no GMO commercialization, it is not about food yield. <sep><sep> We were moving towards where workers remain to start developing this political consciousness, this necessity to develop concrete solidarity with the working class in South Africa. <sep><sep> Ti-mama speaks of “Second Republic”, where she can come to power as President with power after a “New Constitution” is voted in. <sep><sep> And, then, we will have to fight against dominant ideologies. <sep><sep> Some even know how to launch their own enterprise to produce confectionery, lazles, ice cream, crystalized fruit, sugar, sometimes on a semi-industrial basis. <sep><sep> In the beginning, there was a movement for contraception. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Politics is difficult because people do not look beyond their noses and politicians are happy to enjoy themselves. <sep><sep> Because every language in society is inherently objectifying, when we are looking to change the production system, there is a problem that we need to continue to give people a salary. <sep><sep> When Vacoas, FLMBS, Moka Flak were in difficulty, during the Ut 79 strike, they laid off 2,000 transport workers. <sep><sep> We find that people need a car, even if they don't have money. <sep><sep>It was 2 rupees, and these Rs 2 were enough to cover the cost of fuel, and we did it ourselves. <sep><sep> It was done directly, they explained, a double-edged sword: the bourgeoisie puts direct pressure on the MMM. <sep><sep> The MMM says that it will defend "vulnerable people, workers, the middle class to defend authority, public security, democracy, justice and against corruption." <sep><sep> Due to the pressure that LALIT and other organizations working together with us have put, the PT-PMSD government has needed to take a firmer stance in support of the Palestinian state. <sep><sep> The political reign for capitalism here in Mauritius, on the one hand, it stabilizes itself through an "Historical Bloc", even though it is bad, through the times. <sep><sep> This means the planter class was fighting against what they perceived as exploitation by the rich. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, Finance Minister Sithanen continues his "shave and burn" neoliberal disaster policy. <sep><sep> Our activists have also been involved in several other associations, including MLF, LPT, JUSTICE. <sep><sep> Water shortage is a major issue for people with limited funds in Rodrigues. <sep><sep> When the "communication" pretext faded, the pretext became "Communism". <sep><sep> In regional meetings, branches, Central Committees, we constantly reflect on how to acquire these skills and resources to recruit people. <sep><sep> He has shown an international level, especially since people in the States and Great Britain are opposing war policies and military bases, so it is possible to gain allies in our fight. <sep><sep> It comes from an organization with members. <sep><sep> They don't know what to do, they start to stand up, they carry their banners. <sep><sep> The link between political and union struggle is based on developing a common program, for resistance, and a common program to propose an alternative. <sep><sep> They go further by highlighting 2 points in their 20-point Manifesto, relying on religious symbolism, they have a double lever. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that time, there was another movement, a movement towards globalized material production. <sep><sep> In the case of Mauritian Creole and Bhojpuri Mauritian, as we all know, there are 92% of people who say they normally speak either one or the other or both of these two languages, so it is absolutely a majority in terms of numbers. <sep><sep> At the same time, they strengthen trade union bureaucracy because in this crisis period, the government and the bourgeoisie prefer to negotiate with one or two gurus rather than with democratically elected representatives who are workers. <sep><sep> The law did not recognize the rights of living partners in a same-sex relationship. <sep><sep> It also should specify whether there is "Market Access" (as they write it as "MA") and it must specify if the market is truly open, or otherwise, if there are any restrictions, for example, on the number of universities. <sep><sep> Similar to us, trade union federations and some degos parties in the Platform are also against targeting. <sep><sep> It is an award for all workers in the security industry and it is the same for all artisans, same salary, same work conditions. <sep><sep> It was a Friday. The first day of the strike, a Wednesday, was not enough. <sep><sep> Also, its price is not linked to the amount of work involved. <sep><sep> With her intellectual sophistication, Liliane had also put forward proposals for each detail in the necessary labor law sanctions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are certain regions where the land is more fertile, where there are rivers that flow regularly and where we have done some political work to support. <sep> <sep> The alliance "The Future", is not looking at the future; it is only sitting on a social volcano. <sep> <sep> In Lalit, we believe that many people in prison also have the potential to change. <sep> <sep> When the bourgeoisie takes over the Labor Party, it is an alliance between 2 small bourgeoisie/bourgeois newspapers L'Express and Advance, a specific national unity. <sep> <sep> Transitional demands need to start where workers are, and from that point, draw a path to taking power. <sep> <sep> Through this Reading the LPT is giving a space for poets and writers to express their desire for freedom and to resist repression. <sep> <sep> And its level of knowledge of foreign languages is better in the world. <sep> <sep> Ziz Seetulsing said that the Supreme Court cannot in any way determine the community of people based on its "way of life", which the Constitution says is the way communities should know each other. <sep> <sep> More than this cannot be increased, without a new law. <sep> <sep> All this to say that it is not entirely impossible that its Manifesto WANTED is incomplete. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Wherever you encounter something that is not welcomed in the revolution, resembling crossing a military line, and tell anyone "Shoot if you want to shoot!" <sep><sep> The birth of LALIT was in the 1970s, which means in a time where here in Mauritius as in the world, there was a lot of effervescence: forums, debates, and also major mobilizations of workers, unions, young people and students, and in general education. <sep><sep> The second point, and we see this on television every day. <sep><sep> - Why are you laughing at me? - I am not laughing at you, uncle. <sep><sep> It is true that there is a problem with theft, people even pass on a motorcycle next to one and go off. <sep><sep> Due to its geographic, political and strategic position, Jericho continues to develop and its needs are beginning to be felt. <sep><sep> We need to start a parallel state, so that the economy is not only in the hands of those with power, so that the Government has a certain control over capitalists, and to prevent monopolies that have remained since colonization; <sep><sep> About the agricultural reform, they also don't know that there is already a Manifesto behind which people are mobilizing. <sep><sep> It is a way where we have been able to influence the campaign so far, and even the influence of the current government. <sep><sep> At a workplace, you will have workers who say, "Yes, I agree with a bonus!" and others say, "No, we don't agree with a bonus, we need to fight for a salary increase instead." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is no constitution more democratic than "The Founding Document of the American Constitution". Unfortunately for blacks, this was not practical. <sep><sep> There are strong brakes to counter, but they do not prevent the Government's pro-capitalist policy. <sep><sep> They put emphasis on the fact that, while in the modern capitalist domain of power (starting a dozen years before 1800 in a country in Europe), the working class is an oppressed class, but it has the interest and the strength to move out of this oppressed position, and become politically powerful, and then organize the social economy in a way where no longer need different classes of social class to exist. <sep><sep> For its second phase, Minister Duval has indicated that it will be a phase that represents the continuity of its ultra-liberal economic policy. <sep><sep> And he had a turning point, and maybe we contributed to making his work as significant. <sep><sep> Contacted the OAU, there were several meetings, I remember in the Municipality of Port Louis, several meetings with delegates and OAU and UASI, discussions. <sep><sep> The union's struggle often involves only visits to increase the rations of "modern slaves", rather than abolishing "modern slavery" completely, just as they ended slavery. <sep><sep> During this decision-making process on our participation in the General Election, that is to say whether we will put candidates or not put candidates, let us look at our 5-year balance sheet. <sep><sep> Mayk showed us a olive branch that has started to dry up and is dying. <sep><sep> The State has so much power that officers who have a monopoly on violence (police, prison guards) they abuse this power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Article II (e) of the Genocide Convention states: "Genocide is the intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group". <sep> <sep> In the working class, we have seen a centralization of sectors in the economy, with the secondary industry in the last 10-20 years, where 55,000 permanent workers have become 3,500. <sep> <sep> Now, the US economy is collapsing, it is facing threats, and this has been happening since 2007. <sep> <sep> - Why are they trying to make people stop receiving elderly pensions when they reach 60 years old? <sep> <sep> But what is important here is that, if we reach an understanding in common, then it will help us move forward. <sep> <sep> The Social Alliance has also established strict regulations to address post-poverty issues. <sep> <sep> The issue of internationalism is always part of LALIT's action: it is necessary to have an international struggle against the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> Bureaucracy, when it wants, it puts you outside, or it raises you up, where you become useful in the struggle for socialism. <sep> <sep> And yesterday, what made people pity Serz, is that they were the first workers that Misye appointed to be laid off. <sep> <sep> This means that they will suffer the "hire and fire" regulations that have been prevalent in the private sector since the time of slavery. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation in the country Sitronela was so dramatic that hope was almost completely lost. <sep> <sep> For example, which sector will create new job opportunities in large numbers, what will the future hold for the working generation after 2009? <sep> <sep> Families in rural areas come and go, among other occupations, facing difficulties. <sep> <sep> Everyone has the right to move freely in the country, and this right has existed since the end of the "pass" system in the Langazman era. <sep> <sep> The third protest day We found that the Ministry's Cabin was locked. <sep> <sep> Only yesterday, on the 13th of October, more than 3000 books were published. <sep> <sep> and he will likely earn a substantial salary, that is to say that he will continue to show courage like merchandise for yet another favorable moment. <sep> <sep> This concept of "avant-garde" refers to workers by race. <sep> <sep> Now that you have to shoot, and I'm here to help. <sep> <sep> Is this what Berenger calls "progress," is this what they want to continue!? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This includes the directions of certain Federations (MLC), some are in the MMM movement (L'Estrac, for instance, certain sections of GWF appearing like CEB Isoop Peerbux, on one side, and the Sidist group, on another side, and the Syndicalists, as a third option.) <sep><sep> This date back to the revolution with Rom, during the time of Henri VIII, during their reign of power. <sep><sep> During a brief stay in Japan, Ragini Kistnasamy, a member of the Lalit leadership, participated in 5 events in Tokyo and in Okinawa, all Lalit against American military bases. <sep><sep> They didn't even realize that it was possible that the boss let them gather wood so that he wouldn't have to give them bills. <sep><sep> We must use "European compensation" to create jobs rather than destroy them! <sep><sep> But yet, they have joined this Platform together with Bérenger, Pravind Jugnauth and Ashok Jugnauth, whom they are in favor of targeting. <sep><sep> The Labour Party/PMSD government, the opposition of MMM/MSM, both have the same quality of economic policies. <sep><sep> It has continued, is continuing, and if we do not act, it will continue. <sep><sep> The Ramgoolam government is doing nothing against the military occupation of our territory. <sep><sep> But, the government, after the elections, even in a 5-minute speech when Ramgoolam proclaims a deputy, he is talking about old age pensions becoming universal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economics, luck, it's one thing, "social" another; economy one thing, ecology another. <sep><sep> We can say that the "lar" has brought the class struggle, almost its "science", it is to be understood that the demand to support it, it must be served with the same methods to support it. <sep><sep> So much so that this idea had struck Resitans and Alternative, Rex Stephen had written a letter in Le Mauricien to say that the Best Loser system is still there. <sep><sep> The list of organizations that endorsed the Common Protest in March 2004: <sep><sep> Putting us on a boat, then another bigger boat. <sep><sep> Holding a program like the one LALIT is defending for more than 30 years. <sep><sep> After a seminar each member has their "action plan" in their back pocket. <sep><sep> But the Government was forced to make quite remarkable concessions (in terms of officials being on probation in MRA, nor will they work on contracts anymore). <sep><sep> They are using religion to break all their opponents. <sep><sep> We are beginning to load the Health Documentation, for example, the first 3 "LALIT Document" files are in, plus 2 more copies of LALIT are already on the web. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Instead of the Sun of Peace, it's the Sun of War that is prevailing. <sep><sep> A delicate situation, a fragile balance. <sep><sep> Before he even explained the Lalit proposition, he said that there might be journalists to remind that in 2002, Lalit had already predicted what is happening today. <sep><sep> We all need to see that aggression as a violation is "not too important", it is linked to the status of a "diverse act". <sep><sep> It is marked in the law that one has the right to stop the law also, and what is strange in that is that in some countries, where it is marked, the right to stop the law exists. <sep><sep> Nadja Rakowitz also explains the way Marx's entire work has three phases: a criticism against capitalism as a system. <sep><sep> They also came to defend the goals that, unlike the previous MAAS, the establishment and Boolell would have been forced to plant sugar cane for the next 7 years. <sep><sep> Like we discussed after Papa Lindsey, this neo-liberal ideology favored organization in "civil society" and single-issue forms. <sep><sep> 3) Workers will lose 6 paid sick days per year. <sep><sep> We find that there is a union movement, but we realize that the union movement is inherent, it exists in relation to the employer. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we celebrated the 100th anniversary, it was also an opportunity to pay homage to the great contribution of LALIT in political literature in the Kreol language: <sep>
<sep> There were 2-3 amendments to the Employment Rights Act, but issues in the 2008 law remained unresolved: employees working overtime, easy dismissals remained, and the trend of starting to report the day after the week begins, also remained (interpreting the concept of "Sundays"). <sep>
<sep> ACA continues, I am not criticizing the American or English people, but these two governments are responsible for what Israel is doing in Palestine today. <sep>
<sep> The first victory, in modern societies, we can notice that for many people, the law (they can have their religion, etc), but many people have a tendency, without realizing it, to consider the law as important, even as valuable as their religion. <sep>
<sep> In practice, it is claiming that from now on the Creole language is an official language! <sep>
<sep> We find that there is a very close link between workers' struggles in the workers' organizations and our political program. <sep>
<sep> Because we find a need for the masses to appropriate the concept of class struggle. <sep>
<sep> Objective factors are what we analyze in society (at national level, and its links with global levels), and subjective factors, it is solely to build an organization that will implement our program. <sep>
<sep> Later, I will come back to the books, but I think that the contributors before me have already given a good insight into the content of the books and the context that inspired their writing. <sep>
<sep> And then, to go further with their demagogy, it is even starting to attack people like Dinesh Ramjuttun, who has already started campaigning against Ramgoolam in his constituency. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> More recently in Europe and Australia, we have seen a transformation of several avant-garde political parties in the labor movement. <sep><sep> How is it going to get out of this situation, and not, as Ram has said, put a bandage on a wound when the wound is too deep to use a bandage. <sep><sep> Cindy Clelie has been tasked with preparing a document containing all the analysis and reflections that were made during the meeting. <sep><sep> And indeed, many people are starting to ask these questions. <sep><sep> "Tonkin" is not a term that a doctor would use, for example, when describing a patient's symptoms to a colleague in a seminar. <sep><sep> When mother tongue was introduced, there were almost children who needed to repeat, there were no children who were failing. <sep><sep> Education for Workers can be greatly appreciated or criticized according to the presence in this encounter between the multiple language diversity and language tension. <sep><sep> But you know, and I will end on the same note, the laborers of Mauritius, a former sector since the time of slavery, are very organized, with many grievances. <sep><sep> There are 3 candidates in each constituency: A, B, C, so there are 6 possibilities of who will be elected. <sep><sep> Since then, workers have started organizing among themselves, sharing the few resources they have. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Capitalists make believe that private property (their motorcycles, their houses, their mountains) is the same as "private property." <sep><sep> When it comes to trade union movement, federations and confederations, they do unified rallies every year. <sep><sep> It is time to develop mobilization, continuing mobilization that LALIT started in 2003 reaches another peak, an alternative economy that is in the interest of workers and the masses. <sep><sep> Have we found what progress in LALIT for a better education system? <sep><sep> But this is a process, when you examine it, it is a process that is making Medine come out of a sugar company, it will keep its sugar cane, but now it is becoming a real estate company. <sep><sep> And it is not increasing their 60 lire salary, it. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen who was presiding over the conference of Presidents today in the LPT building in GRNW has put the emphasis on the fact that Lalit is going to embark on a campaign for the government to go forward and to negotiate partially in constituency No.3. <sep><sep> Clearly the army and the state bureaucracy in Pakistan in the West felt threatened if so, there is a Lalit for the "liberation of Bengal" in which the Communist Party was a stakeholder. <sep><sep> Long ago with the IRA, but it is still the same today, but less and less. <sep><sep> It is rather a set of knowledge and experiences that every individual has that we share together in our organization that makes the strength of a political organization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The class struggle, which had somewhat declined, within decentralized and particularly in a movement of degrowth, became a single class against a second class. <sep><sep> When the price of food rises too much, that's when the government starts talking about the possibility of increasing food production. <sep><sep> In other words, the final phase of a classless society has not yet arrived. We are therefore at a standstill with the advent of the new revolutionary class which transforms the face of the ruling, privileged class. <sep><sep> Read the article by Rajni Lallah on AGOA and on the link to this extraterritorial law on the seating of the Diego Garcia base, page 57. <sep><sep> But the strength or weakness of the workers' organization also depends largely on the degree of class consciousness. <sep><sep> Indeed, we must take stock to see how much we lack. <sep><sep> Marx says it right that we are born into nature, but we also enter into history. <sep><sep> We find this in 'A big bowl', where there is work on different animal categories. <sep><sep> "I have sold my courage to him," the worker tells his boss, "When my courage was over, he showed me the door." <sep><sep> A black sheep works for its masters and when the master asks him how much he has worked, he answers 'Yes Sir, Yes Sir...' The master has no name. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Domestic violence is no longer considered a private matter, but today there are still beatings. <sep> And can reflect some of the needs of the population, which if it was a program implemented only within the Government. <sep> Suddenly that means the economy is the way we are already organized socially to produce and distribute what society is already using to survive. <sep> The crisis will worsen further with the increase in the prices of petroleum products, and also with the increase in food prices on the world market. <sep> And today, China is confronting and also economically invading, a new zealot who is producing more than it is: <sep> With such penetration into Mauritian society, we have certain absolutely minimal duties. <sep> L'Estrac was even going as far as calling France a “riverine” country of the Indian Ocean, to justify when it was becoming a member of the IOA when it was being mentioned. <sep> Right there, he has absolute control over GWF, JNP. <sep> Specifically if a blade, a key, wax breaks, then they inform. <sep> The entire village of Salfit was even further damaged by clashes inside the prison. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is in line with our program and strategy, and will help shape our new political agenda, expand our party and strengthen it. <sep> An organization has just been set up to handle the work on the ground, where could this work possibly be done? <sep> Here we are not including its specific $160 billion spending specifically earmarked for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. <sep> Its slogan was "1/3 of our life is on this job: we want to be able to live it well". <sep> Each A4 member had to explain how it works in order to be able to control his instrument, what kind of musical direction he prefers. <sep> all human beings live on earth, when 90-95% of people have no control over their own means of survival. <sep> he had to choose between a candidate who had found himself capable of fraud or what the then Prime Minister in the same Cabinet of Ministers, when the electoral fraud was formulated, and his campaign for that partial election was even more corrupt. <sep> FSM - His only deputy Cehl Meeah is still waiting for a signal from PTr/PMSD to form a government. <sep> And an internationalist working relationship with LALIT is certainly to counteract this nationalist politics. <sep> On December 5th, LALIT member Ally Hosenbokus went to a meeting of Marons. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One cannot remain in a "We do not have rights" position, "We have rights", "This is a right to be taken." <sep><sep> The olive branch also symbolizes the tenacity and resistance of ordinary people in Palestine against occupation by the State of Israel. <sep><sep> It is politically vital to go to such a case. <sep><sep> (The organization that makes profits, whether religious or communal, may be affiliated elsewhere, but not in NWC). <sep><sep> The objective situation presents an extraordinary opportunity for LALIT, so we need to develop our means to seize this opportunity. <sep><sep> It appears that the derivations and bureaucratic trade unionism parties have not yet fully understood how activities and strict traditional trade union practices can cope with the current situation. <sep><sep> He says there will be a free vote in the MMM on this. <sep><sep> Mrs. Macque has said yes with his signature, but the police have not only told him that they are conducting an investigation, nor have they read what they have written. <sep><sep> His life is worth billions of bananas, that too is being discovered. <sep><sep> But, the way to manage these things has changed over time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> to convert from small-scale agriculture to agro-industry for export as well as for local consumption. <sep><sep> Why didn't he start making music and theater with his friends? Why didn't he start with a musical comedy that could be used for agitation-propaganda? He decided to write a play to show that true development is only possible if understanding femininity becomes the new foundation of culture, and he decided to call it "New Man." <sep><sep> In the meeting, we need to consider what to do with him. <sep><sep> We are pleased to publish the paper presented by Rada Kistnasamy for the Conference on Strategies that LALIT organized on March 12, 2012. <sep><sep> Likewise, we have noticed too often demands that the women's movement makes, it is somewhat "forced" by the media, by certain political organizations, or other bourgeois sections of the State. <sep><sep> At the level of the major American foundations, for example, they have acted through organizing their counter-assault against the rise of the movement in the late 1960s by funding a series of "social" and "research" work, but definitively not political. <sep><sep> It also determines overtime, meaning when you work more than you are supposed to work. <sep><sep> But one day, my brother brought a poster of Che Guevara home, he got it from LALIT, I got interested to know who this guy is. <sep><sep> Not only the most ancient language, but also all education. <sep><sep> And if you never keep it, for whatever reason, you will have to realize, to say, "That’s why we didn’t keep our word." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are certain other medications that are taken during the second trimester of pregnancy. <sep><sep> There are sectors that have been severely affected, there are other new sectors that have just started, and this type of punishment is changing the strict class of manual laborers. <sep><sep> But how have the electorate reached this stage of outrage? <sep><sep> Read Alain Ah-Vee's article on the malaise role of the Mauritian State, with its different politicians of the Labour Party and MMM, positions 125. <sep><sep> These forms of a primary class struggle, by themselves, will not necessarily bring about great changes. <sep><sep> The problem between PMSD and the leader of the Social Alliance is not new. <sep><sep> You know, in the old days, for any reason, everyone said 'that bunch are the parents'. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin has raised questions about the role of parliamentary opposition in the last 5 years? <sep><sep> Then there was a case to challenge this revocation in the Supreme Court. <sep><sep> Historical bourgeoisie, it, does not like Ramgoolam in power, because it favors the state bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>After all these gruesome details, the journalist Henri Marimootoo published the story. <sep><sep> Maybe a friend heard on the radio, read in the newspaper, starting last week, a leader of another political party called Muvman Premye Me. <sep><sep> The main speaker was Omar Barghouti, the founder of the Boycott National Committee – BNC. <sep><sep> That means not only can a boss force a worker to work 4 extra hours a day, but he also does not have to pay overtime for those 4 hours. <sep><sep> For him, the wife had to stay home, take care of the household chores instead of trying to share responsibilities with the man. <sep><sep> Another factor that poses a problem for the PT is the specific communication strategy of the MSM-PT party. <sep><sep> When the news of this repression faded on the radio, they released 3 deserters. <sep><sep> The second explanation is that there was a marked complicity in the media during the campaign to make people believe that there were only these 2 layers. <sep><sep> Then when the WTO, the sandstone of, disappeared somewhat because WTO preferential trade agreements said "forbidden!" The sandstone, almost at the same time, America came with its threats. <sep><sep> (ii) schools that teach in a language other than the mother tongue for less than 40 minutes a day until the end of the 2nd or 3rd year. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As a result, MID is trying to analyze complex root causes of all environmental, social, and economic problems. <sep><sep> through a concept of "organic intellectuals" in the working class, who manage to theorize the anti-capitalist experience as a worker, even when they are still in the working class. <sep><sep> The Lebanese government is refusing permission for the Gaza Freedom March to enter Gaza. <sep><sep> CSG in the security sector, in confrontations, not only has questions not been raised, but guarantees of support have actually been publicly provided for this sector. <sep><sep> We have refused, for example, to appear on radio or TV too often, and to comment in the press. <sep><sep> He criticizes it just to take advantage of it. <sep><sep> So there is this civil society, which can sometimes represent more of a handicap in the struggle for socialism, in the fight to strengthen the working class. <sep><sep> The campaign for an alternative economy has become central to our political work. <sep><sep> and also, quite a few new people have expressed an interest in the political work LALIT is doing. <sep><sep> For each editorial, there was a rating. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it is thus that there can be development of a political program. <sep> <sep> And we are mentioning the way other parties take measures for a specific reason: it proves that LALIT has a certain political strength, even if we do not necessarily have the capacity to betray it in a voting only. <sep> <sep> Journalists often (it's a phenomenon) start to work in the interest of private companies, or a sector, then hup! <sep> <sep> Now to make a secret ballot in the Tourism Industry where there are 127 hotels all around and also the workers who are not part of a union will vote. <sep> <sep> It continued on the way a created program, is slowly developing, fading, gaining more and more people who stand by it. <sep> <sep> We do not find that the employers of the security industry have been supporting the Food Security Act that we have signed. <sep> <sep> The first move of the Labor government was to declare a mobilization of the masses who protested against this economic policy. <sep> <sep> There is total chaos within the Labor Party, following a strange recommendation from the Committee, which suggests reactivating the 1972 Census, to include "communities", not just religions. <sep> <sep> According to scientists these gases are already at an unacceptable level and measures need to be taken immediately to limit damage. <sep> <sep> Both the victims and the movement against police brutality within which LALIT is apart, is for the truth to be known about this brutality. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation is lamentable the way Paul Berenger and his associates are behaving in the by-election. <sep><sep> Minister of Education has refused to grant a representative of these 23 villages a meeting. <sep><sep> In 1995, when MMM returned to power, in collaboration with the Labour Party, there was economic consolidation with America. <sep><sep> And the participation of the trade union movement in this National Platform, in particular, makes people forget, makes people believe that there is a solution for workers today. <sep><sep> In the streets, in the market, everywhere in Jericho, there is an atmosphere of insecurity filled with menaces. <sep><sep> Among them is the former President of the Republic, Cassam Uteem (known to have received a mention in the recent section on our website), as well as a member of the Palestinian Solidarity Committee. <sep><sep> Over the past years, the 'Selling of Tantinn Timi' has become a common activity in all villages in the region, from Mapou to Mamzelzann, from Hamlet to Helvesia. <sep><sep> But now it has turned into a minefield. <sep><sep> And the young group Lalit has even announced that they are withdrawing from the Lalit website to create their own open-source website. <sep><sep> After the Judicial Committee and the Privy Council, which have confirmed what Lalit has been saying for over 10 years, that discrimination based on religion among children cannot be tolerated. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, the boss has been granted the flexibility to do his work on a smaller budget, meaning he spends less on salaries. <sep><sep> Finally all the marchers have crossed the checkpoint without any conditions. <sep><sep> Linguapax International was established in 1987 following a UNESCO expert meeting that recognized the need to preserve global linguistic diversity; in 2001 the association officially began operation under the UNESCO Center of Catalonia in Barcelona. <sep><sep> As a reader, it is often difficult to have any ideas about all these different pressures. <sep><sep> This is when it is well known that many of these organizations themselves promote "communal hatred" and common violent practices. <sep><sep> Cynics might also expect a tactic as early as the newspaper published a part that was already as obscene as MMM in 1987. <sep><sep> They were all in need of retreat to the northerly Pakistan. <sep><sep> An old "historical bloc" that has existed until recently had sat: <sep><sep> Alternately one of the better-known experiments, the First International, was called the Workingmen International Association. <sep><sep> State Secretary Lenerzi has connections with companies like General Motors, Ford, Lear Corporation Thommy Thompson. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are implementing all kinds of plans to break the country economically and in multiple ways. <sep><sep> In this Assembly, on behalf of the Central Committee, Alain Ah Vee has provided a detailed report on all the steps and procedures that led to the suspension of Group Zenn by the Central Committee. <sep><sep> In our daily life, we read this, we read that; we hear this, we hear that; we believe this, we believe that. <sep><sep> It also defines things like: how are you entitled to public funds, how are you paid if you work on public projects. <sep><sep> Unity, on one side, a labor union or federation on the other side. <sep><sep> 2. We lack some means and strictness to properly promote our program. <sep><sep> They had no intention of starting a communal fight; they were protesting against State violence against Kaya, and possibly against State violence in general. <sep><sep> I WAS HUNGRY I was hungry, your smile was my comfort! Let's go through the night together, when the sun rises we know it will go to work. <sep><sep> She is called Barbara Jean Fields, and she works at New York University. <sep><sep> Who is controlling this service, if they are threatening to take it back? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I have acquired depth, honesty, and integrity. <sep><sep> Today, I will give you the position of the LALIT Party on the Welfare State. <sep><sep> It absorbs a bit of big capital with it; the more it aligns itself with the PMSD, which represented the establishment bourgeoisie (before). <sep><sep> On one hand, we are asking the State to increase its repressive arm, on the other hand, we are delivering families to the station. <sep><sep> They are embarking on an IRS (Integrated Resorts Schemes) strategy and the development of a savage tourist hotel, which is turning our country into a playground for world playboys. <sep><sep> Great Britain is not only stealing money but also rights of peace in the territorial waters of Mauritius, especially the Chagos. <sep><sep> The boss tells the sardar to send the girl to work all alone under the mountain. <sep><sep> Great Britain is moving forward to recolonize through the Marine Park. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, focusing solely on ecology, it is based solely on the environment without taking into account other factors. <sep><sep> LALIT received this film thanks to the Corporate Solidarity Committee of Palestine in Johannesburg, South Africa, when Alain Ah-Vee went to Palestine in 2004 to participate in the struggle against Mirror Apartheid. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He has been greatly influenced by punk music and other forms of rebellious music. <sep><sep> Because Minister Zafer Etranzer did not accept the invitation, afterwards he realised that the decision should not be made in the Friday's Ministers' Cabinet, and we haven't heard anything yet. <sep><sep> So we are facing this government alone, but one thing, I said earlier, that Navin Ramgoolam will have to face a historical government far more solid, which has diversified a lot. <sep><sep> We have looked into the political situation considering its historical specificity. <sep><sep> It can be said, "But there are also values inside, not just work," but the values of the inside, they also depend on how much work is inside. <sep><sep> Conditions for a fascist State, it becomes a nightmare when there is a major economic and social crisis, and where the petty bourgeoisie becomes desperate because of energy inflation and the general economic crisis. <sep><sep> From our perspective in Lalit, we are considering the beginning of the end now. <sep><sep> Jabaljas: There are these places where every time there is a heavy rain, there is flooding because Minister Baichoo has not cleaned up enough. <sep><sep> It is also disturbing that it is becoming increasingly evident that major tourist companies are supporting this type of land use. <sep><sep> Regarding the Employment Relations Act, the amendment has made strikes more difficult. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is necessary to bring the police, RIOT, to the general assembly as there was a clash between 2 groups who were getting conflicting directions. <sep><sep> large companies (and other less fortunate families), training (to cushion the blow), tourist villages. <sep><sep> Apart from the 4 categories found in Schedule 1 of the Constitution for the nomination of Best Loser. <sep><sep> One of the responsabilities of the "economic democratization" cell in the PT for its work on defending workers' rights when the government was amending the Sugar Industry Efficiency Act (SIEA). <sep><sep> They are talking to men who are waiting for service in the village of Hares under a big tree. <sep><sep> There must be respect for the resources the child brings forth. <sep><sep> We do not find the energy that animates our souls, but it is there. <sep><sep> Workers are starting to work on voter registration in preparation for the elections. <sep><sep> LALIT proposes that you go vote, vote for a "blank ballot", meaning to put a large cross through the ballot. <sep><sep> It is fantastic, as Rajni said, to find friends here today on a scale that, we can say. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are pleased to publish the transcript of the speech Rajni Lallah made on behalf of the Movement for the Liberation of Women (MLF) at the LALIT Conference on Tuesday 1 November on "What does the MLF expect from a political party?". <sep><sep> Jean-Pierre Lenoir, the extreme right-wing in Mauritian bourgeoisie, in Hebdo (9 March, 2008) announced that, "I was at one moment alongside Father Gregoire. <sep><sep> We have not received a response from anyone until now. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin continued to say that recently there has been quite a spontaneous mobilization of the working class, where there have been quite large workers' demonstrations, a first in Rose Hill, and then others. <sep><sep> What we have been saying for a long time is that in the face of "threats and intimidations from outside the country" (as Berenger has just discovered). <sep><sep> But, the Trade Union leaders have systematically entered a campaign to force him to resign. <sep><sep> We, we have been running a campaign against this, Comrade Kreepalloo, for 7 banana years, to change from this strategy offensively. <sep><sep> Can the Sugar Industry in Mauritius absorb a reduction in prices of more than 37% in a 2-year period, despite the systematic redundancies that the VRS represents for more than 8,000 workers. <sep><sep> And when these 3 victories tend to come together? <sep><sep> LALIT is holding a series of THREE FREE COURSES on the theme "Understanding the world to change the world". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Remember their suffering, remember their forced displacement, remember this genocide, remember the cruelty that the British and American governments have inflicted on the Chagossians, it forever stains Mauritius' atmosphere. <sep><sep> The Pa Bush Platform brought the Commissioner to the Supreme Court and won a victory. <sep><sep> This is primarily due to the economic mutations in the country and globally. <sep><sep> We need to break free from this historical capitalist block. <sep><sep> In his world of luxury, manipulative women, petty thieves, net encounters with Paloma's ruthless army, with the seasonal dignity when they go to the restaurant. <sep><sep> The hotel sector is also facing challenges to attract more tourists, despite invading new spaces and seizing natural resources such as water, land for agriculture, beaches, and the sea. <sep><sep> Overall - it is a generalized perception in Mauritius - people have found traditional political parties, political parties that could be called "mainstream," they have achieved two things: <sep><sep> But, in the end, in its core, it's an MMM core. <sep><sep> In these half-lit passages, a new site has emerged. <sep><sep> I thought this finding is important as a basis for this paper because it may help us understand in which direction these parties are going, whether they are buzzing around or are likely to buzz. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The 1971 resolution, but starting to make progress towards a UN Conference on the Zone of Peace. <sep><sep> The army 'does not want international forces to put their lives in danger in Nablus.' Soldiers say they are doing their job and following regulations. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, we are witnessing an American imperial offensive showing their intention to intensify and strengthen their presence in this region of the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> We are also sending a signal to strengthen all military bases - starting with Diego Garcia on our territory - which poses a potential threat to our region and humanity as a whole. <sep><sep> No other federation has even said thank you for your letter. <sep><sep> Major economies are struggling because we are living from crisis to crisis. <sep><sep> *Governments must expropriate bosses who are colluding with the economy, putting society at risk. <sep><sep> There are members of Lalit who have gone to Palestine to participate in protests there. <sep><sep> In the new Integrated Resorts Schemes, we are seeing people who are starting to work there in domestic services. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam was saying not to get involved in this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He successfully organized his National Forum, established a Creole Academy, and the Creole spelling is being formally presented to the government. <sep> <sep> Workers no longer identify with him, he no longer has relationships with individuals or within his class. <sep> <sep> Their Jeep is also blue and has a small blue/red flashlight. <sep> <sep> After Chady resigned as deputy, the government could have organized a partial election to replace him in October 2004, for which the electorate No. <sep> <sep> All these analyses have ensured that we start a more solid political response to the political and economic crisis in the form of a "closed-state" of traditional political parties that we did in October-November. <sep> <sep> Mobilization of women to decriminalize abortion, the second issue on which we have a partial victory. <sep> <sep> Then people started shouting "corruption!" and started a common talk against the PT Government when it was trying to get votes to remain in power. <sep> <sep> This historical bourgeoisie was attached to its basket, its disk, its mallet (and until now it is still the same), and it was socially blocked in a mold that it could not easily absorb new capitalist sections and expand easily. <sep> <sep> Most women in villages who gather together to work: some sew and embroider, some do laundry work, some raise sheep for meat and cheese, some raise bees for honey. <sep> <sep> Clearly in a first democratic period, more political, it is stronger, and then, when the movement weakens a bit, Islamists can take advantage. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Tonight's show was introduced by Alain Ah-Vee, from the Libertarian Party of Togo. <sep><sep> Cyril Monty analyzes what these figures show very clearly. <sep><sep> Long ago in human history, a philosopher used to call something "religious alienation." <sep><sep> - Ram Seegobin wrote an article in LINKS, the review of the Socialist Democratic Party of Australia, on our campaign for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> We are seeing this, because it is the only real guaranteed service to humanity that we know of today. <sep><sep> What is necessary is more democracy for the working class in Latin America and its inclusion in Tibet. <sep><sep> This demonstrates the constant struggle of the MLF, as well as Cassam Uteem on this issue. <sep><sep> He used to work for MBC, but deliberately chose a low-profile tactic. <sep><sep> But only if we have accepted, all of us, to go in the same direction that we need to take, to blaze the same trails, then we will have completed our collective work. <sep><sep> Later, in '83, due to the collapse of the currency, all kinds of predictable crises, without exception, we regained a common consciousness that became stronger. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They discuss what the man wants, what the syndicate wants. <sep><sep> "Sustainable Mauritius Islands," it is also a phrase that originated in the Bidze Duval Speech. <sep><sep> All your lettering and other installations on the mound were apparently damaged. <sep><sep> 6. Then, the others came to help: there is a trainer to teach in MIE. <sep><sep> A confidential document presented by Alain Ah-Vee on "Lalit Action Report during 2004," showing how many actions Lalit has brought from many years that became central in 2004. <sep><sep> But now, we have to think about how we will work together to give our own ideas. <sep><sep> In 1982-1983, it was the state bourgeoisie that had Jugnauth and Boodhoo behind them to beat the MMM for the government. <sep><sep> In addition to these three events in Tokyo, Ragini Kistnasamy also went to Okinawa where the presence of military bases was known to be absolutely dominant, and where the struggle against the base was also very strong. <sep><sep> Whatever they want, they say it jokingly, it is the right to speak up, without putting the community at risk. <sep><sep> Propaganda vs. Plead for the Problem, the fact that the Resistance propaganda brings is not the same as what it puts in its cases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mario Darga, he came to the Cathedral, there too, had come. <sep> <sep> The priest destroyed the big wood container with barrels of flour/rice, there was a family with a yellow like a mouse and a very short sleeve shirt that is used for sharpening the branches that have a lot of olive trees. <sep> <sep> Poetry Section, First Prize Rishi Bukoree for his poem "Poetry of a Rebel", and Prize Encouragement Sedley Assonne for his poem "Three words for Kaya". <sep> <sep> For example, in the tourism sector, now there are 40% of tourists who do not stay in hotels. <sep> <sep> The women's movement for women's emancipation, is not interested in finding a woman's internal group of patriarchal leaders. <sep> <sep> But there is also the same neoliberal offensive, that neo-liberal offensive. <sep> <sep> It was draconian. Telma says that we can't imagine. <sep> <sep> The economic situation in the country, and how to develop a political strategy to change the economy. <sep> <sep> The war of languages that certain individuals and sector groups are perpetuating today is not helping at all.  <sep> <sep> We went up to Mount Abel to see Nabluz from there. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The education system teaches children languages that the school shows to be detrimental to their mother tongue and natural. <sep><sep> In an interview on RFI in 1983 he said "I am not looking to find out who owns the hen but who will benefit from the eggs. <sep><sep> Comrade Yves: A sentence from an ancient Greek, Tucidide, about 3,000 years ago comes into my mind. <sep><sep> - even though we often follow in the footsteps of popular movements, they are inherently rightful. <sep><sep> It is a dynamism in society. He used the term "finality". <sep><sep> We slowly started to ask 'But what can we do here?'. <sep><sep> Some members have also started to know a little bit about the history of revolutionary countries in Indonesia through Zely Ariane, and through books by Max Lane on Indonesia. <sep><sep> International messages from left parties and organizations in Laos, Australia, Denmark, France, New Zealand, South Africa, and more from the Fourth International. <sep><sep> At that time there was a Ramgoolam-Duval-Mohamed-Boolell government, in the 1970s. <sep><sep> However, Creole language has yet to become a language that can be officially used in the National Assembly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have started with the victim of illegal labor, a victim of a patriarchal law. <sep><sep> In this context of economic crisis leading to a general degeneration in society, there are many contestations arising without taking a clear political form. <sep><sep> And employers, certainly cannot escape responsibility. The Ministry of Labor, which, among other functions, has the power to grant or refuse permits for workers from abroad. <sep><sep> And before that, when there was a war and the first invasion of Iraq, we formed an anti-war committee, which later became a broader front, known as the Anti-Imperialist Coordination Committee. <sep><sep> 4. What do you think about the power strategies of political parties? <sep><sep> * In general, the country is in a serious crisis because since its birth it has relied on discrimination, and today (40 years after independence) that protection, which made discrimination profitable, is no longer legal according to the World Trade Organization. <sep><sep> In the campaign for the Lalit by-election No. 3, it is mainly based on a strategy to solve social problems caused by the economic crisis, through the creation of jobs. <sep><sep> even if they need to use this hysterical reaction that exists in the minds of the public seriously affected by the serious social crisis. <sep><sep> At no moment did the government at that time (PTr) contest the conditions of the AGOA. <sep><sep> A: Indeed, briefly, we can discuss this information later, it is the advantages of LALIT which have a base in trade unions and among the workers of a company, either among the workers of a sector. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He tends to get into a lot of chaos before managing to create a will among many people for a new start. <sep><sep> Minister Sik Yuen, a PMSD Minister, has resigned from his role, it appears he is no longer in the PMSD. <sep><sep> which is a large international network against imperialist military bases. <sep><sep> This reminds us that the war of science brings light to the well class, it is an analysis that brings different claims. <sep><sep> Us, being in an ocean of bourgeois ideology, we separate ourselves into compartments so that we can function: work here, relax here, family life here, life with friends here, political life here, with a slight breakthrough. <sep><sep> This is an unconscious matter, and is not always expressed. <sep><sep> This will only be resolved when women start voting en masse for a party that promotes women's liberation. <sep><sep> It exposes the MMM, PT, PMSD, MSM's failed strategies. <sep><sep> and in 2002 we presented a proposal that was popularized during the Sachs Commission. <sep><sep> He did not stop teasing Donald Rumsfeld's “preventive attack” declarations that take him for a philosopher. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then he went to get some money, he bought a thinker. <sep> He even made great headlines in the last Labor Day that he will shoot the Advance newspaper. <sep> We are all working towards a program, organizing and mobilizing to strengthen the class of workers behind such a program, a program that truly aims to reverse the system responsible for exploitation. <sep> Today we must not rest on our laurels and be satisfied with the fact that Creole is entering the education system. <sep> All claims that have been submitted have been rewarded, from a 6-year-old child to a retiree. <sep> In the same graph, we have developed a complete pedagogy, for students, to train teachers in "Teachers Training courses". <sep> The manifesto launch has garnered enough media coverage (for a false media) through 3 interviews. <sep> Berenger used to say, with reason, Unions have a direction that they do; now, we cannot hope <sep> Many people are certainly trying to find a way for MMM to enter the Government together with the Workers. <sep> We call this crisis a "systemic crisis", and we call it that because it is a crisis that is happening for each and every economy. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A thing, a feather for example, has 2 types of value. <sep><sep> And that's also what we are facing today. <sep><sep> Interview with Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Militan Rezistans and Palestinians whose parents have witnessed partition, expulsion, imprisonment. <sep><sep> According to me, it was a turning point, at that time there was a mobilization, the fact that in Medina, in Fueq, in Belom, in Linyon, in parts there were SILU-UASI branches. <sep><sep> To present 2 years they have finished hoisting, paying in advance at $104 per barrel. <sep><sep> And this idea helped to create an extraordinary bond between the women's movement and the widow. <sep><sep> But, because Diego Garcia is part of Mauritius, and because Mauritius is part of Africa, all this nuclear arsenal that the United States keeps there, with the consent of Great Britain, it has become illegal. <sep><sep> (Blueprint for Sustainable Diversified Agri-Food Strategy for Mauritius - July 2008). <sep><sep> In the Legislation, the only active party, and when elections come, it wins - and it represents a certain rebirth compared to the revolution that took place in the Tarir region. <sep><sep> We found a company established in Mauritius called Fake Busters, which is coming to search, and bringing the police with it, for any products sold under a brand that is allegedly pirated. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this chapter, I was intending to start my speech with "where they were" and then transition in a Marxist way towards "the economy". <sep><sep> The mid-session had an excellent meal: rice, sunuk fish, black lentils, fuyapen curry, and stuffed beans, complemented by a mango dessert made by comrade Ram. <sep><sep> A jeep was stopped and blocked from entering our village. <sep><sep> To conclude, Ram emphasized that the February Congress Reports had been referenced in the book. <sep><sep> Several communal-religious societies—Absorb another political party, IFB, and many other created parties. <sep><sep> On 7 September, 25 families in Staleland Belmar received eviction notices for their homes that had been demolished. <sep><sep> And you have this on your conscience. <sep><sep> There was a time during the years 1983 to 1995 where we had a "Jugnauth State", where Aneerood Jugnauth had his people he appointed into the state cabinet. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the color yellow had become a qualification to become a boss, sub-boss, sub-sub-boss, non-boss at all but the big boss because the big boss's position was a result of inheritance, slightly changed, property and command Supreme. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the secure bourgeoisie is starting to establish a sugar industry in Tanzania, in places like Divwar and Kenya. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT has been engaging in discussions with different groups in this current phase in Lang-Leter, France, Australia, South Africa, America, and Reunion. <sep> Nadja Rakowitz introduced herself and her partner, Ralf, as individuals who have been trained in Marxist school-of-thought in Frankfurt. <sep> We don't have a fixed program, a rigid program in place, a program that has been completed to make it more enjoyable over the years, and we are still focused on the same issues, no. <sep> MSM, even when it was in opposition, was treating itself in a very disrespectful manner. <sep> Every worker has the opportunity to come to these assemblies to provide their opinions, make decisions on whether to continue or stop. <sep> They no longer believe that by mobilizing together they can change anything, or even "get something" without the approval of the senior individuals. <sep> Max Lane, a "member at large" of RSP and working in Singapore, was also a speaker for this public forum and described the situation of the working class, the trade union movement, and the left-wing party in this global movement. <sep> It is time to move beyond those who are more deeply entrenched in thinking, those who can still react naturally, who have not been exhausted by customs, conventions, and the inertia of society. <sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who presided, mentioned that he had become a tradition in LALIT for a comrade to attend an international event, and we hold a meeting so they can share this experience. <sep> However, we must ask the question: Why are these rights disappearing? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In places where there is a wedding in a family, everyone is invited to the ceremonies that unfold during the wedding. <sep> <sep> In our country, we are used to seeing this kind of phenomenon. <sep> <sep> I don't know much about Mauritius, but I think it is very serene. <sep> <sep> Protest against the presence of French imperialists in the Indian Ocean (outside the French embassy in 1978). <sep> <sep> It is noted that Maurice Paturau received a medal for his contribution to British services during the Second World War. <sep> <sep> It is evident that since 2008 when the law was passed to compel companies to give 2% of their profits to social services of their choice, it is actually serving the interests of private companies. <sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie, unhappy with what Marx has discovered, are now finding these analyses. <sep> <sep> The old school is too small and cannot accommodate all children because the village has expanded, and the number of children coming to school has increased. <sep> <sep> A political party is an organization that represents the interests of social classes. <sep> <sep> Even if you can read, you can still put a cross in the vote, but if you can't read, then you don't know how to read. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What does it mean when organizations like S.O.S Femmes, Media Watch, Soroptimist accept to take action since the United States, the time of the military occupation of Iraq as well as the United States? <sep><sep> During a conference in Mauritius, Ram Seegobin said he agrees with the end of protectionist regimes and also with the direct effects of capitalist globalization and the imposition of WTO regulations on smaller states. <sep><sep> When it comes to education, health, law, trade union movement, today's world, the masses are ready to mobilize for it. <sep><sep> As a reaction, he wanted to build his life according to his dream where there would be dignity. <sep><sep> Because we are in the same economic exploitation system, where there is global exploitation, it will result in the same effects on the oppressed class in the world. <sep><sep> LALIT has already published a book on this, just before the elections. <sep><sep> The working class wants it to react like a class. <sep><sep> 3 million have already gone to rest in Europe (especially Spain and Italy) and the USA. <sep><sep> And finally, it is recycling in the middle of people, and you develop diseases like cancer, because of all the mercury absorbed. <sep><sep> So, the deputy only uses it in a super-informal strategy and very often in the village. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And now, where we are, we have a job to revitalize our campaign, a mobilization work where everyone understands what this political campaign of LALIT is and what we are aiming for. <sep><sep> 6,000 people have lost their jobs in VRS 1, then would you believe it's 8,000 losing their jobs in VRS 2. <sep><sep> Prisoners say they won't stop their strike until the prison administration meets their demands. <sep><sep> - LALIT and Rama Valayden's (MR) position on police brutality. <sep><sep> For those who have made it a priority, it is encouraging in the force when we put our heads together to see what we will do next. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, there is a lack of people who need to buy this course with CEB at a price that is threatening to rise again. <sep><sep> So, there is a process called "metabolism", where in physical matter, it is constantly converting. <sep><sep> In this campaign, we had to face 3 problems: <sep><sep> So now we need to act to stop children attending school. <sep><sep> And I am writing my lightning when the phone rings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have no interest in finding a true solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka. <sep><sep> When it was announced that this bug Reddy is returning as the manager of the State Bank, it means it is a man called Aneerood Jugnauth. <sep><sep> Among the comedic and humorous comedians, there are Micheline Soobraydoo, Sam Ammigan, Lindsay Moutien and many others. <sep><sep> Also, in the history of Mauritius, our great people have already staged a big, great rebellion in 1937 and 1943, where the Commission of Inquiry (Danket Commission) said there should be a pension. <sep><sep> Rights of Return, True Reparation, can the Chagossians get them? <sep><sep> It is the State of Israel who broke the deadlock in November 2008. <sep><sep> The French invasion in Mali, followed not only by this military campaign 'Operation Serval' against the Islamists who had invaded and settled there. <sep><sep> This will create a raft against this measure by suggesting that it will be harmful to women, children, and disabled children. <sep><sep> I can read the resolutions of the United Nations in Kampala more than what we achieved yesterday, one. <sep><sep> Today the 11th March Mr. Pentiah is in the District Court of Port Louis And. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> FOOD FOR THOUGHT is a new publication, presented by LPT. <sep><sep> There is a different political climate, where a rather confrontational debate is taking place, so we have set it up in the Port Louis Municipal Council, as a neutral space. <sep><sep> The main difficulty faced by the working class to seize power is that before it seizes power, it does not hold economic and ideological power. <sep><sep> In the Soviet Union under Stalinism, an bureaucratic apparatus to-power was created and maintained. <sep><sep> This is because at the LALIT level, we find a new phase in imperialism today. <sep><sep> And this crisis concerns dominant ideology, the capitalist hegemonic ideology. <sep><sep> In other words, in its head, the best loser system does not form part of the electoral system. <sep><sep> Toupoumwa had a great ambition to inherit and was using Bandoukland forces to satisfy all his desires. <sep><sep> It seems like we are on the defensive, where we only respond to what the government and employers do, it seems like we forget our own program for punishment. <sep><sep> It is women's work to bring children to a clinic or hospital, to take care of sick people, to attend parent meetings at school ... <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You enter it like an object, like a product, you enter it. <sep><sep> In 1983, in our program, we had already put: "Priority mobilization… Bring the police force and the fire brigade Syndicate rights." <sep><sep> The quotas and guarantees that protected these two sectors are being dismantled with WTO dictates. <sep><sep> And also, every great strike, every great strike movement, it produces what we call a "vanguard". <sep><sep> It talked about promoting the development of a reading culture through multilingualism and intellectualization of the mother tongue when children are still very young. <sep><sep> There is a list at the end of the book that is very worth reading, or rereading. <sep><sep> Clearly, when people have synonyms that other participants do not know, they have more identities, they are not in the country, nothing is clear. <sep><sep> The first time in 23 years there has been this alliance. <sep><sep> There is also NESC, which has become more and more important in the trade union movement, through restrictions where there are academics, civil society, etc and where trade unions are becoming a civil society goal. <sep><sep> A man's son died in a bombing and another man's son is in prison. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> It is clear that since 1965, it is the bourgeoisie's interest, embodied by PMSD, that has determined the pre-colonial State's attitude at the time of the separation of Chagos and the installation of the US military base on Diego. 

At the same time, while Eddy is claiming to have brought nothing, we have carried out this great collective liberation, through action after reflection. 

This means that if you stand on this kind of position, the true fight over Diego Garcia and Chagos cannot count on the GRC's support. 

Writer Victor Serge has described this period in his books, "Year One of the Revolution" and "Memoirs of a Revolutionary". 

Alain Ah-Vee, who has presided over the Conference of the Native Mauritians, which was mainly intended to launch books against the communal system, formally announced to the press that Lalit was aligning its candidates for the election.

Raj Meetarbhan likewise; Akilesh Roopun likewise, and Nazim Esouf likewise. 

One day, a journalist comes at 5.00 or 6.00 in the morning when we’re distributing leaflets, they will find Lalit's influence on the ground. 

He took care of his arrangements and put his companions on the other side so that the show can become mobile. 

If it's true that for the moment trade unions and workers are focusing on wage increases, they should not fall into the government's trap that is trying to divert attention from other very serious problems threatening workers in the transport sector, as well as in all other sectors. 

Notice that he did not say that it is the private sector that needs to finance PPP. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, nothing has changed. <sep><sep> There are basically 2 ways: either you say everything directly, in an atomized way; atomize is like a spray, it's scattered like that. <sep><sep> Today, in this demonstration, we are reiterating our support. <sep><sep> Present for Lalit were Alain Ah-Vee, Lindsey Collen, Ram Seegobin, Rajni Lallah, Cindy Clelie, and Ally Hosenbokus. <sep><sep> Just to show how this logic, it's a logic that has been coming from afar, how many times they will recall past governments. <sep><sep> The Lafis campaign in Cuttaree constituencies is warning it, contributing to the Launch of the Protest Platform on September 10 organized during the big March in Port Louis. <sep><sep> The majority was so deep in thought that, like zombies, they were still dragging their feet on the beaten path of routine; <sep><sep> We made a treacherous decision in the Kreol Employment Rights Act, which we have done. <sep><sep> But, trade union work brings improvement to such an extent that employers find it more profitable to replace workers with machines. <sep><sep> Sharon Jacquin, a member of the Lalit Youth Group, formed part of the Lalit delegation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This year, we also had conflicts in FCSOU. <sep> <sep> For the third time, the militants of LALIT Roland Fozoo clashed with the police. <sep> <sep> "Grandmothers and children compose exams together." He had good results. <sep> <sep> a poem that takes the form of a warning, a constant dilapidation and degradation of our natural environment because of selfish development, waste, and mainly because of our gluttony. <sep> <sep> Partly because there is so much crisis in the capitalist system today that it demands punishment, it. <sep> <sep> where we are switching from defensive to offensive, our political campaign for changing the economy, our programmatic work, then, well! <sep> <sep> So the topic chosen for this cause, it's really the best topic. <sep> <sep> Whether it's America, whether it's China or India, they have to ensure their supply of oil that has to pass through the Indian Ocean. <sep> <sep> Private sector, according to Pravind Jugnauth, should enter the Government's Capital Budget. <sep> <sep> According to World Bank figures, there are more than 1 billion people on the planet who are poorly fed, suffering from hunger problems. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Sunday, Abu C. stopped at a stall, bought us a mango and a chocolate bar to thank us. <sep><sep> But sometimes, there is a dramatic need, which we call "revolutionary." <sep><sep> Then Dr Surnam dates his report on March 11, which is a day after Dr Ramstein's report was published in the newspapers. <sep><sep> When the capitalist economy is in crisis, we find that the government and the bourgeoisie are coming up with legislation to accelerate the decomposition of the trade union movement. <sep><sep> The MSM-MMM government, like the previous PT-PMXD government, is deeply involved in privatization politics. <sep><sep> We, people who follow politics, we people who want socialism, we need to understand everything that is happening. <sep><sep> You too, encourage and spread this kind of anti-corruption politics, in scandals, do not leave space to propose a true alternative. <sep><sep> Another aspect of "Economic Democratization" is the conflict that arises out of the production of surplus. <sep><sep> According to Lalit, a primarily legal victory has value only if action is taken while the politics is in place. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin spoke about the Alliance for the Future which he said was formed from the unconstitutional role of President Aneerood Jugnauth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we found that the Americans are invading Chagos, the French in Tromelin, step by step, capitalists are invading us. <sep><sep> Is there any conditions of existence that surpasses the reality that exists in a particular moment, such as the current capitalist system in which we live? <sep><sep> These heinous crimes are a clear indication of a deeper crisis in the family institution. <sep><sep> Working in a bus is a difficult and tiring job: it is impossible for drivers, conductors, and mechanics who are responsible for the lives of thousands of passengers, to still receive a wage that is less than the minimum vital necessary for a family to survive. <sep><sep> And this all started with the colonial system, in the interest of the imperial bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> What have we achieved in these 5 years in terms of politics? <sep><sep> Only in Mauritius, Finance Minister Rama Sithanen, says everything is fine, "the Mauritian economy is resilient!" He does not mention the fact that hotel bookings are being canceled. <sep><sep> When there was a budget speech for 2013, everyone agreed that it was a very empty budget, without direction, without substance. <sep><sep> 3 rights of return and more compensation for the Chagossians. <sep><sep> It is clear to everyone now that Orange Mauritius has advertised its new product for itself and Facebook immediately after Lamars. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have to convince the working class that it is a question of life or death to look at the economy. <sep><sep> And they say if anyone wants to do something like that against us, our members should not come, let that person come, we will expose them for that kind of violence. <sep><sep> So globalization is not something we are living like all our ancestors, in the past. <sep><sep> Legumes like beans with plantations (peas, sunflowers), legumes to transform apples, legumes to transform oranges. <sep><sep> Yesterday our campaign for legal rights began at the No. 3 conscription when the CHA was privatized. <sep><sep> Yesterday the government already had a mandate to bring that kind of policy in. <sep><sep> Everyone had already predicted before, and it was announced that the editors-in-chief were meeting once a week. <sep><sep> Through measures like these, many countries in the world have been ruined. <sep><sep> The first power is its Minister, him. <sep><sep> Mackenzo who lived in a swamp with his family and a little baby said he had no other place to go. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> 1971: With unrest in the report of force, countries that opposed the idea of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace were forced to resign. <sep><sep> The proposal of capital punishment, free media, health, communism, as a formal start. <sep><sep> recruiting new workers with this minimum salary, because most sectors now have a different minimum salary per sector which different Award gives now. <sep><sep> a subversive movement, financed by a country unfriendly democracy, which has links with the mafia, drug trafficking was trying to overthrow the legitimate government elected by the people admirably. <sep><sep> Workers classes, women's movements, unemployment, youth, small farmers, small traders – that's what we mean. <sep><sep> When there are development processes that take care of this land, it will not be available for other forms of development that the country may need. <sep><sep> So as long as everyone "believes" in dollars, has "confidence" in it, everything is fine. <sep><sep> It cannot have an allocation of more than 1 year. <sep><sep> Then we start to get class struggles as we understand it today. <sep><sep> A week before that, he was taking away working permits from certain workers more involved than others in Sentosa lands, and sending them back to their countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The owner is quite patriotic: his slogan is "in the interest of the country". <sep><sep> And, in the first 12 years of its existence, he even said that in this class alliance, the "vanguard working class". <sep><sep> So, in all the demands in this strike, on the 23rd of November, provide satisfaction. <sep><sep> They also see the cooperative as a tool of "Black Empowerment" to bring about the expansion of a new capitalist class. <sep><sep> Then when we look at the factors that bring about mutations in the trade union movement, there are certainly those that affect strict trade unions, strict federations, etc., and those that bring sanctions in strict working classes themselves. <sep><sep> On the platform, there are also other soldiers who take turns to go to their posts or go home. <sep><sep> In a sector of each country, for example, there are militant and strict means, or there are "media" to promote the program. <sep><sep> And they create a series of ideas, a philosophy, that reflect their understanding of the world their class lives in. <sep><sep> The media is really a propaganda tool for private companies, which unfortunately they exceed. <sep><sep> Yannick and Yann Durhone, who manage the restaurant, appreciate the effort as well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, the crisis in the Lighthouse, it imposes itself on us. <sep><sep> So, the first thing to note that is worth following today is not to follow the bourgeois ideologies that say that Marxism has been "surpassed". <sep><sep> By the end of the 19th century, colonialism encouraged the marginal lands to plant sugar cane, and crush it in its mills. <sep><sep> Until the workers realize what Infinity has reached - has it declared bankruptcy? <sep><sep> During the last five years LPT has started this process and this unit has become important when Kreol Language is becoming more and more written. <sep><sep> At 4:00 pm we finished breaking all the coconut. <sep><sep> Vinesh Hookoomsing also presented LPT a copy of this special publication. <sep><sep> Small business workers, nurses, SILWF workers, MITD, restaurant servers, hotel day laborers, sports teachers, music teachers, large license workers, hotel musicians, nurses, writers, journalists, actively participated. <sep><sep> But there are other items that represent the basic needs that are even more serious than Moris. <sep><sep> Okay, what about economics (I am speaking of true economics, not HSC economics!)? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We also strongly condemn the violent Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. <sep><sep> Furthermore, as a third point, the Government is encouraging the Integrated Resort Schemes (IRS) process and the Road Map also mentions that the Government will provide assistance to attract clients for IRS. <sep><sep> They have been able to involve an important participation of young people and have ensured a new generation of writers is assured. <sep><sep> Timi needed to explain what his daughter was up to. <sep><sep> In Gondwana, each village was a large family, like a tribe or a clan and was encouraging young people to get married, as much as possible, outside the village with people of the same caste. <sep><sep> Soldiers always had their rifles aimed at people and were speaking of all kinds of threats of arrest and deportation early in the morning to Vienna. <sep><sep> Gramsci analyzes how each social class has its own ideology, its "organic intellectuals," as he calls them. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, in their affidavit, a public matter, Blok 104, Resistance and First Me Movements, they see, they make a solitary affirmation, that they are not challenging the status quo. <sep><sep> The enemy of our enemy may say that the people of Mauritius are starting to learn the enormity of these IRS schemes. <sep><sep> But we're not going to get back into that today. Today we look at other factors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Otherwise, while working, we forget that Berenger and Jugnauth laid off 800 Development workers. <sep> <sep> The event was organized after artist Nitin Chinien illegally detained Ian Palach and was assaulted by police in the MCIT/CID Curepipe office on the 13th of July. <sep> <sep> The government must ensure food security through all these measures for the country to be the most self-sufficient in 5 categories of different food products: a. <sep> <sep> Each time the young people met us at the three Sadous, they were in trouble. <sep> <sep> That means it will be easier for the employer to issue licenses. <sep> <sep> There's a lesson to be learned here, and intelligence, and the capitalist class plays well with it. <sep> <sep> In this strategy, the workers are being fooled by the masses, without any true punishment in the ultra-liberal economic system that brings a lot of damage, insecurity, and misery. <sep> <sep> Go to the post of Vice President of the Republic. Lift it was a position that seemed to go to abolish all ways. <sep> <sep> So, we have advances very quickly, not one person at a time, who is converting. <sep> <sep> Today we have a Zini State where its financial system, its banking system, - as you have followed, has been destroyed in 2007-8. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Only Black Panthers are against capitalism and against state coalitions, with a student movement that was conducting sit-ins in particular. According to them, democracy was "going too far" in the years 65-75. <sep><sep> In every millimeter of burnt rose petal, there is a tiny flame. <sep><sep> The government is imposing taxes and rates for capitalists, either to pull money into their own pockets or to give capitalists direct power. <sep><sep> It's a cunning move, even though sometimes they pretend to be impartial towards political parties. <sep><sep> Individuals who claim to be reasonable are breaking away from their police force, troops, corruption, waste, destruction, and violence. <sep><sep> Everything I'm learning, I'm sharing with Sinndi. <sep><sep> The Second International also erupted and after the war it was reconstructed under a different name, "Socialist International," which regroups bourgeoisie parties, among which is the Mauritius Labour Party. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Government is bringing forth a series of measures that aim to prepare for the privatization of health and education services. <sep><sep> We are aware of the discussions we had with Philippe Sand, the Prime Minister in London, and our legal advisors. <sep><sep> Workers are taking us through the back roads, across the lea, through grasslands, etc., arriving at another location. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Treatment Pelindaba has integrated the process that Paul Berenger proposed in 1990. <sep><sep> It has also cited Rehana Aumeer and Asha Rampadaruth as victims of licensed arbitration by MBC and SBM. <sep><sep> It will use all means, especially when his dad is President. <sep><sep> When they didn't receive the Zanvye Peace Prize, they demonstrated with a demand for a meeting with their player Jean Suzanne. <sep><sep> They even chanted "Apply the Rapor Carcassonne" in their comments. They demanded that their request be included in MMM/MSM's proposal, even if MMM-MSM is creating a communal economic security guard instead of a party leadership. <sep><sep> In the university they visited, the students collectively decided which type of curriculum to adopt in consultation with their professor. <sep><sep> There were discussions on how working conditions in the agricultural sector do not encourage people to work there. <sep><sep> In different phases, capitalism has expanded its monopolies, its partisan domination. <sep><sep> He says he has done this, that, that, that, that, what he clearly confesses before us is, "Neither me, nor my friends with me in all these actions, we had no idea of ​​a strategy." <sep><sep> In a radio program where I joined Ahmed Parkar, Chairman of the Joint Economic Council, he announced that the Lerop textile market collapsed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He participated in all kinds of events in the secular character reception. <sep><sep> Once there are sports conveniences IWPS-ISM in plantations where there are serious threats <sep><sep> Fukuyama's "eternity" has been completely completed in less than 20 years. <sep><sep> And the police and listeners came together to announce the dismissal of the boss. <sep><sep> Meaning he filled it with content of another word, "citizen". <sep><sep> Big-big processes like Tian Li, who were supposed to start from the company since Lasinn in Ter Ruz are late. <sep><sep> In addition to a growth of 5 percent as much as Lasinn 7-8 percent per year. <sep><sep> So they have come together, separated, re-came together: they flatter their friends, insult their friends. <sep><sep> Lalit represents hope for a society where everyone gets what they need, where everyone gives what they can. <sep><sep> and there were also trade union activists, activists in the women's movement and youth movement as well as activists in the cooperative movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> * After Biddya, we went to Mas-ha to meet a family (I think Alin found that family on Tuesday). <sep> <sep> We have a relationship that is part of national education. <sep> <sep> He wanted to learn from families who were eating their mangoes. <sep> <sep> There was also no one who was able to resist this. <sep> <sep> He will commit himself, quite often, because he has neither, at the moment when he realizes he has neither. <sep> <sep> Ten families of MLF spoke, one after the other, in front of a room where families have been mobilizing for the last 30 years: even if u find the history and representation among u, while preparing a Manifesto for the future. <sep> <sep> The offset system, the boss couldn't put it in England, he went and put it in Ireland, and then from there the newspaper has followed, the magazine disordered from Ireland. <sep> <sep> Jugnauth-Berenger-Cuttaree did not respond to the workers' petition in the French Zone. <sep> <sep> SILU-UASI continues to meet, despite a hundred delegates coming to the National Assembly, despite the transport strike. <sep> <sep> The houses next to the 4-5 storey flats are a bit like the NHDC flats in Bambous on each side of the mountain. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recruit new members: within branches, within the LALIT Commission, during actions on various campaigns, through the Party's newspaper, during the distribution of leaflets, posters, meetings. <sep><sep> During this international meeting in Cape Town, there were four speakers. <sep><sep> Present individuals were taken aback by the beauty to express solidarity tonight. <sep><sep> Dinesh was the one who encouraged Timi to put more weight on his political work and eventually Timi, as he called himself, allowed himself to discover another way to do politics where cultural work boosts political work. <sep><sep> And with the community system, its caste ramifications, and the symbolic ones repeated by the religious-ethnic groups, individuals eventually slid into a communal retreat with a partner. <sep><sep> What the MSPA has been doing for some time now is to propagandize for moving towards stricter laws in other countries. <sep><sep> Ever since the old Ramoo used to feel that he was desirable and he grew in a different way. <sep><sep> - Why did the Government Minister protect the Mauritius Commercial Bank when there was a disappearance of more than 800 million rupees of workers' pension funds? <sep><sep> In 2006, a journalist from L'Express approached Lindsey Collen for an interview. <sep><sep> There is a press that appears more free than Mauritius, and where there is virtually no censorship. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The delegation has gone to meet with representatives of the Arab League to ask for their intervention with the Egyptian government to lift the ban. <sep> They have been around for 30-40 years, since the 1970s, and they have consolidated their strength in 1995. <sep> There were others like Joseph Needham and Haldane who were also well known as scientists. <sep> It reminded us that in bourgeois ideologies there is a species of law that is unwritten, but harsh enough: "The question of economy must be absent from the democratic debate". <sep> A political organization plays an important role in the scales, ensuring continuity in political action. <sep> * Focus our thinking on national and communal dances, and diminish them. <sep> They used the Court as a platform to popularize their ideas in favor of working-class unity on an international level to bring peace against the bourgeoisie. <sep> Then, this political party, and its program, have privileged links with certain upper classes or multiple classes, and have conflictual relationships with other classes. <sep> Arvind Boolell plays the same game as his father, by placing challenges by intervening. <sep> and to replace him with the same system as a mandate, only because he believes that we, ordinary people, do not know how to serve our welfare. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Instead of successes, there are still failures everywhere <sep><sep> Dilapidation and public property theft through privatization, putting in question social and economic rights such as old-age pensions, free healthcare. <sep><sep> The difficulty we have encountered in our campaign is that people, in general, do not understand the electoral process and do not understand its impact on the everyday lives of people (such as water problems, housing problems, food security). <sep><sep> When they cannot pay off their debt, their debt starts increasing. <sep><sep> Is there a progressive role for nationalism in anti-colonial, anti-imperialist struggle? <sep><sep> Comini felt that there was a conflict in his name. <sep><sep> He said they were not accounting for time on earth, but rather for time on the moon, and beyond. <sep><sep> It ends with a situation where there will be four mules, between 2,000 artisans instead of 12,000. <sep><sep> This is because it leads to destruction of nature and also poses a direct risk to everyone's health with the GMOs they have. <sep><sep> The union says we have found today, we demand a 20% increase in wages, the employer says no they can't. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was bureaucratic, highly repressive, with a state in control and dominating. <sep><sep> Language is seen as a natural capacity that everyone has. <sep><sep> short evaluation (kurt) from month to month and from permanent mammoths. <sep><sep> I suppose for Ashok Subron it appears he has thought that this is a good tactic. <sep><sep> Advancing in his status, he wanted to become an "Indo-Mauritian" bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Two young women from the leftist movement have spoken: one recited a favorite poem, the other gave a testimony. <sep><sep> But, as individuals, a person becomes a militant in a revolutionary political party. <sep><sep> when we see the incidents happening in the campaign with statements from the leaders of the communal-religious organizations. <sep><sep> They have dismantled it so it's no longer binding. <sep><sep> America, today, when you land at the airport, you will find a sign marked in English, ALIENS. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Workers were commuting from Médine to Tamarin, Bambous, Petite Rivière, Canot, Beau Songes, Cascavelle, Plaisance, Bassin, Barkly, in all these villages. <sep><sep> In the sugar sector, for example, there was a collective agreement in 2010 that all unions and all employers has signed. <sep><sep> But at the same time, we found a flaw, a lack of coordination in these mobilizations and especially in strategy. <sep><sep> This was only temporary, because the Government and the private sector had only plans to deal with a cyclical crisis, not to face a systemic crisis where the 2 largest sectors, large-scale employment and foreign exchange. <sep><sep> The English version of this article was published in Le Mauricien (Read it in English by clicking "News" below the header on the home-page). <sep><sep> Grand Bay traders' representative told that there is a severe problem in the trade sector. <sep><sep> He has been in power since his birth in 1983, between 1983-95, 2000-05, 2010-2011. <sep><sep> NGOs, often do not have either the analysis or the solutions to fight with the issue. <sep><sep> He has indeed declared that capitalism is a demon, it is eternal. <sep><sep> If there is food for our children; if we can afford a balanced meal for our children; if there are homes for all children. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are experiencing a Systemic Crisis in Mauritius. <sep><sep> The highest level of class warfare (on a site) that I have discovered in Mauritius, a level of class warfare, is in the year 1971. <sep><sep> We realize that the State of Israel through its army is doing everything to prevent any development in Hares. <sep><sep> The support we are getting in this election, is a way for the working class and poor people to express their will to mobilize to face the threats that are coming. <sep><sep> Here, there is a small lake with a small area in a millimeter of limestone covered by carbon empire. <sep><sep> It fits with our self-education that we get in regular branch meetings, that we know our neighborhood, know our own work site. <sep><sep> In LALIT, when we started talking about the systemic crisis, we ended up realizing that it is a crisis that will affect society as a whole because of sectors such as textiles. <sep><sep> The past two years have seen an increase in theft, crime, licensing, violence, abuse, old-age. <sep><sep> Spiritual leaders were asked to submit themselves in front of a Supreme Chief who has blonde hair and blue eyes. <sep><sep> The more workers understand the true nature of ERA, the more workers will mobilize against these two laws. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They refused to leave the factory premises because they said since 14.30 the police and Tang Knits company officers had arrested and detained their friend Zheng who was negotiating with the boss as the spokesperson of all the workers. <sep><sep> Great Britain really wanted to sign with Mauritius, because when the Royal Navy stopped 12 Somali pirates, it didn't know what to do with them. <sep><sep> It was the Ministry of Social Integration looking for work for Mauritians in other countries, then puts them in transport to move them to other countries. <sep><sep> How does a Government, a Labor administration, encourage the development of this state bourgeois bureaucracy? <sep><sep> L'Express, who also favored Independence and represented another section of middle-class and upper-class workers apart from the Labor Party. <sep><sep> Children, all of you, have the opportunity to develop better intellectual capacity, especially in reasoning, abstract thinking, and creativity. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, pay attention to the way the Israeli State uses immigrant colonies to dispossess Palestinians of their land. <sep><sep> more social services are free for everyone (education, sports, art, health, water, electricity, housing, childcare, universal pension, free public transport or very low fare). <sep><sep> Enough talk, surely their spokesperson is starting to discuss the fundamental issues posed by the crisis, but in general they adhere to the logical 4 keystones ruled by capitalists. <sep><sep> If the Euro was not anchored as well, many more countries, companies, and individuals would have defaulted on their dollars, adopting the Euro. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Company/consortium can have a profit return through a mixed injection of funds and also fare/tariff. <sep>For the working class, priority is employment, job security and salary level. <sep>And within a week, all editorialists in this country will be talking the same way. <sep>This is how an end goal was planned, later our country is becoming a military base. <sep>In Lalit we say the MSM-MMM Government has been bending too much in front of America and Great Britain. <sep>After all the statements of the Minister of Finance, Minister of Tourism, etc, where fortunately our tourism industry is resisting, then the months of October-November start feeling the impact on tourism here in Mauritius. <sep>The strike has lasted almost 2 weeks, in the security industry and in the general strike. <sep>So a comrade takes responsibility to prepare a paper on, called "Kiba", and we learn from it. <sep>He started by publishing a "policy paper" on the 5th of May, 2003. <sep>A poor peasant like Paloma would not normally go to have a makeover in a grand salon but it's mainly her actress-like appearance that makes Diego lower his gaze that captivates Paloma in a world of enchantment-Fire-de Leon Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The social crisis is causing these kinds of problems at a societal level. <sep><sep> We note that the press has placed a blackout on this support. <sep><sep> For example, he said a political organization had psychological preparation for a part, for its activists. <sep><sep> MMM  was very defensive during these conflicts. <sep><sep> Of course, he didn't work for free, but besides services, there was an additional something. <sep><sep> Ideological manipulation by the media especially media controlled by multinational capitalists and the advertising industry. <sep><sep> And even if something is profitable, and he can buy it, if the worker next to him does 20, 50, 100 times as much, he has no personal relationship, no personal interest, and the 20, 50, 100 times he does in a day. <sep><sep> While the peasant is looking for his family and daughter, in the film, a young woman has come to look for her husband who has been working for 2 years in the same field. <sep><sep> What happens then according to the law is that they send him home for 2 weeks, check him, and then there is, that's it, corium. <sep><sep> So, people are worried that the state is neglecting the threats that are weighing heavily on employment and job security. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another accused who had turned accomplice, had also been arrested. <sep><sep> But we must keep in mind that some people identify their community with their religion. <sep><sep> Then, when Radio announced that Jeff Lingaya was a member of the RA, Jeff Lingaya explained in detail that he was doing the hunger strike not as a member of the RA, on the contrary, "17" members of the RA told him not to do the hunger strike! <sep><sep> There was no hunger strike, and everyone was supposed to renegotiate in November 2013. <sep><sep> At the same time Some Anapolis is meeting, what is happening in reality in Palestine in that same week? <sep><sep> A class, a community, a worker abroad, a Mauritian mentality, etc, all the sufferings that capitalism itself is provoking. <sep><sep> So, since Independence, sometimes it ensures the establishment of front settlements, sometimes it freezes big companies' fish, sometimes it sells the man's jacket, different opposition parties have marched. <sep><sep> Throughout the entire movie when it came to making a decision on a matter he accepted Paloma's decision like this he could put the blame on him later. <sep><sep> Where, in these moments, we live in another form of "state". <sep><sep> For all those who have been present here today, on a Saturday, where we all have all kinds of life issues on our minds every day, for anyone who has made it a priority to come here, in the name of LALIT, a warm welcome. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a moment in history where George W. Bush, President of the United States, arrogantly declared that he was going to visit Mauritius. <sep><sep> This contrasts with the pensions of deputies and ministers. <sep><sep> RA has also added many phrases to the Best Loser. <sep><sep> The boss can say, "Yes, I'll give you a bonus," he is obliged to. <sep><sep> In Singapore, this Identity Card also indicates that the "race" of the person is shown on the card, similar to the "passes" during apartheid in South Africa and the "race" on the card. <sep><sep> When NPC comes, that first cashier incident is quite dramatic. <sep><sep> There is also a link here; in ancient societies, tribal identities, it is not something that has completely disappeared from our planet. <sep><sep> In the second session on "internationalism," where there is a global crisis of the capitalist system, the importance of internationalism to confront it. <sep><sep> And what is important is that this worker, and other workers who work with him, will learn. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin has highlighted, despite the fact that Lalit has been reflecting and making proposals for electoral reform for a long time, Lalit has not participated in the current process. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin has finished with a critique of the faith which pretends that even a fake egg is a life: he says that so far he hasn't found the lantern ceremony for a focus point. <sep><sep> Following a "pronouncement" by the UN Human Rights Committee, while Ramgoolam says that this will be a retrograde and passeist measure. <sep><sep> So we program it to include links with other organizations that are bringing the same milk as we are. <sep><sep> But, often Ramgoolam says he is reconstructing the old Labour. <sep><sep> It is this privatization that allows this kind of repression against unions. <sep><sep> But without control prices, this reduction in income tax has not been reflected in shops and stores, and it is large merchants who have benefited the most. <sep><sep> And it is this class struggle that bridges the two: between the trade union struggle and the political struggle. <sep><sep> Muvman Liberasyon Fam has written an open letter to the Minister of Family Rights, Indira Seebun to ask her. <sep><sep> It is interesting that we have finally managed to get something that can allow us to do something like a Creole. <sep><sep> So, they form a formal alliance by starting a "Platform for a New Constitution". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We started the journey with a thirst for peace in the midst of the Gaza bombing. <sep><sep> But, there are some conclusions that we can draw. Many have had fewer votes than usual. <sep><sep> I was thrown into the unknown on the beach as if they had crucified me. <sep><sep> Once again, the labor movement was demanding amendments, unable to clearly establish what amendments they exactly wanted. <sep><sep> For the SILU, there was a Jhurry in the Court which also had the same. <sep><sep> The program's full name was called "Lagoon capitalist system and Fourth International Responsibilities". <sep><sep> Saxophonist, Samuel Laval, who "inherits" the saxophone from Ernest Wiehe, paid tribute to his master in the presence of a great musician and teacher, Ernest Wiehe, who passed away this year. <sep><sep> Alfred, Arianne Cavalot-LEstrac, Dany Adone, Sister Cyril Mooney, Francoise Labelle, and others. <sep><sep> If everyone became entrepreneurs, if every child invested, if every child contributed, distributed, and consumed Gonndouana products in abundance, in nests and in crops. <sep><sep> the risk of flooding and severe tremors that will render the entire residential process in Chagos very dangerous. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Ram Seegobin was a key witness because he was involved in all construction work for the SILU-UASI-OUA project in the security industry. <sep> <br><br> The Sunday seminar that we are holding on the 1st of May and on Saturday the 14th of May will continue this reflection. <sep> <br><br> Following this victory, the Freedom March entered the city of Qalqilya. <sep> <br><br> - to bring about a political let-up in society, we must not be prisoners of this dominant ideology. <sep> <br><br> And this measure is a measure to ensure that this crime occurs when the Government allows the establishment of large land sales on the basis of the IRS (Integrated Resort Scheme). <sep> <br><br> Furthermore, the president of UPSEE, who had called for the Platform, had already started looking into the MSM and MMM separately before. <sep> <br><br> Today, the issue of food security affects everyone immensely. <sep> <br><br> There are many factors that contribute to an education at the grassroots. <sep> <br><br> MAAS said the Blueprint will continue as before, as it has been operating for the past 10 years. <sep> <br><br> When looking at today's suicide figures, it is found that there are 2 times more women in suicides than men. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are living in a time where society is in crisis in a way that highlights the flaws of the capitalist system. <sep> In Mauritius, because the government is forcing children to learn "big" languages in a "big" way, through the "retirement" system (meaning the removal of the mother tongue) rather than in an "additive" way (in addition to the mother tongue). <sep> It's not too different from the spelling we have been using since 1976. <sep> We, we should take this to give to the children. <sep> Then they will attack the principle of free health and education for everyone. <sep> We will see how important timing is in mobilization. <sep> A week later, when they were having breakfast, Sandhya told her husband, "For three days, every night in my dream a voice talks to me." - What did he say to you? - " Princess Prathna, Princess Prathna, when the time comes to go to the banquet at the castle. <sep> The enemy, the enemy, will find for the 1948 elections, many elements of the Advance Group confront the PTr. <sep> If the Control Tower that monitors pedestrian and vehicle movements, access to roads and tunnels that are forbidden to Palestinian vehicles, we have more than 750 points where the daily lives of Palestinian citizens, their children up to their old age suffer all kinds of harassment so they can move around. <sep> We read what was closed, and found the way Condoleeza Rice's hand was in each sentence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are coming together to strongly emphasize the need to convert Diego into a non-military Tsunami warning station. <sep><sep> As I was saying, since brevity is the spice of not being boring. <sep><sep> It looks like the bus stops on Zonn Frans Cite Valleeji with three benches inside. <sep><sep> Everyone has worked to understand the existing system, then discussed and made proposals that we have written down. <sep><sep> Rape and violence are at the core of suffering but sometimes necessity becomes a frozen phrase where your clarity and intelligence are mingled. <sep><sep> A part of the 2,000 arpents of land set aside for establishment, the Government had announced its use for agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> Ramgoolam and Berenger are using words that are supposed to be a gateway for their “working together.” <sep><sep> Our political program, our strategies, depend on the strength of the working class for them to become a reality. <sep><sep> When you are a citizen, you are entitled to all political rights, all democratic rights. <sep><sep> The Zionist state that has vetoed all resolutions in the UN condemning Israel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And today, the government and establishment have announced that there is "no future in division". <sep><sep> Friend Yves: I want to come back with what Ram has said, that is, about the new uniforms, what kind of new uniforms, to help us in a big mobilization? <sep><sep> So we need to know what nationalism will rise to the occasion in this moment, as friend Kisna has said. <sep><sep> Checkpoint recalls every inhabitant in the West Bank that all movements are under control and that one is not free to go where they want. <sep><sep> When the Government presented this law, it mentioned measures that would "reduce work". <sep><sep> We find that there needs to be a legal reason to stop anyone. <sep><sep> It is Prime Minister Jugnauth who announced for the first time that there will no longer be subsidies on universal exam fees. <sep><sep> so the State issues permits for importing duty, medicine, batteries, biscuits, cement, shoes. <sep><sep> We also found strange things like at a meeting in Septam, the trade union RA cast a vote of no confidence in the Workers' MP, Nita Deerpalsing, to condemn what she has done in industrial relations in the Security Industry. <sep><sep> This has developed with Independence where a vacuum was created when the British returned to England at the same time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Last weekend, the Education Commission held a meeting in order to examine in detail the proposals made by Minister Gokhool for the education system. <sep> <sep> Several statements from the new government ministers confirm the new trends of the Mauritian State. <sep> <sep> We are pleased to publish the testimonies that Edna Menes shared at the International Conference on Diego. <sep> <sep> 6) CLASS LEADER: What role does the leader play in different people in society during this crisis? Or does it affect all classes equally? <sep> <sep> However, there is a difference in strategy between the Government and the Chagossians group. <sep> <sep> It seems that the State is subsidizing essential matters such as national archives, national/international culture, dance, music, creativity. <sep> <sep> We are finding that the new government, led primarily by Berenger, is receiving all kinds of support from religious and communal groups. <sep> <sep> There were several requests for this event, but primarily against the fact that the Zama base is becoming a "servant" for the American army in the Pacific. <sep> <sep> At the same time, the PTR has a very repressive policy towards ordinary people. <sep> <sep> The Dutch East India Company has even reported a traitor who has infiltrated its general headquarters. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Berenger prefers to focus on addressing this essential issue and has simply stated that he is awaiting a representative from the World Bank to calculate your salary. <sep> In January 1992, when Paul Berenger becomes Minister of Foreign Affairs, after the general election in 1991, he issues an "ultimatum" to the UK and threatens to bring up the issue of the Chagos Islands at the United Nations. <sep> The issue of land ownership is linked to the water issue, with water scarcity issues in specific regions where there are many young people who have completed secondary education but are facing difficulties in finding employment. <sep> Like in every election, LALIT will put forward candidates, as they have done before we all make a decision on the nature of our participation. <sep> The army conducted a search and entered the homes of M.A.'s father and brother. <sep> He wants to promote social consciousness, a consciousness among different social classes, and that he is totally opposed to class struggle. <sep> Both lands were well developed by their owners, the Euro-Creoles, descendants of the first pioneers who came to settle on this piece of land on the African continent. <sep> The way he confronts neoliberalism is as an international strict, trying to find a way within the capitalist system. <sep> Establishment owners must then negotiate with him to continue their economic dominance. <sep> Then bring a Resolution before the United Nations General Assembly to address this issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Planters armed themselves to protect their crops and clean their fields. <sep><sep> 70% of sales and petrol imports are made by sea, and 50% of container cargo travels across the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> Home, for many families, is now a place where we experience more violence. <sep><sep> Often, history remembers events that have occurred as merely dictated by those in power. <sep><sep> There is no discourse to explain why they are there. <sep><sep> But, as Alain was also saying, before the strike, we would have to face a strike leader, it was called a "foreman's strike", "boss's strike". <sep><sep> It is not bureaucratic rivalry/consolidation that is needed: rather, it is the development of a platform based on a revolutionary socialist political program that will allow the working class to deal with crises and begin a process of questioning the capitalist system responsible for the crisis. <sep><sep> And they have a member (even if it is more symbolic) on Omnicane's board of directors. <sep><sep> This is how the "historical block" has functioned since Mauritian society was created in the colonial era: We have a "historical block" in operation which revolves around the production of sugar cane and rum, where different elements of different classes coexist - all united, over time, essentially (but not exclusively) by the Workers Party. <sep><sep> Is it the same Dalai Lama that the Prime Minister Lalmayn, Angela Merkel, greeted as a beacon of democracy recently? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Friend Yannick and Kisna have explained to us that in Venezuela, there is a popular "Bolivarian militia" that works in collaboration with the "missions" (which focus on social life, ecology, health, and education). <sep><sep> They have explained how there are logical aspects involved that make it even more interesting. <sep><sep> In the same publication, there was an article by Cassam Uteem denouncing this activity as well. <sep><sep> Do you know that since last year, the Government has announced, and this was planned for a long time, that the salary compensation will be more automatically based on the cost of living, on the CPI (Cost Price Index). <sep><sep> So, really, families in that meeting back in the 1990s at Lakaz Ros had a point: they need to know how to manage their economy in their family budget. <sep><sep> Very quickly, Berenger took a stance in favor of retaining the Best Loser System, even though at a certain moment, he said sometimes you shouldn't declare your community. <sep><sep> * The police union is particularly important because it allows for a potentially more democratic control over such an entrenched place in the police force. <sep><sep> We have deliberately gone backward, since this union movement has been controlled by total opportunistic bureaucrats without principles. <sep><sep> The current global crisis is a systemic crisis. <sep><sep> That it is against the MMMSP for giving preference to alliances with the national bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They admitted that they themselves had stopped the boy, and kept him. <sep><sep> It is a visceral species they share for Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> What is their protocol when a guard enters and detains someone on the premises? <sep><sep> Especially when the USA withdraws from Iraq, the focus shifts to Pakistan. <sep><sep> (Only the left-hand side of the agreement, in its entirety, is a complete site that allows for this kind of enormous lack of integrity.) In fact, Block 104 is a fairly wide alliance that includes up to a whole section of people in the historical bourgeoisie, like the head of MCB for example. <sep><sep> For example, this year in March, we shot a scene on the Lindepandans road that was distributed to all screens. <sep><sep> The question I ask myself is whether the current government has a real political will for us to depend less on nutrient importation." <sep><sep> We looked at it in between people so that they can write, each individual's capacity to express themselves, their experience in writing. <sep><sep> What purpose is he offering multinational companies in the "health service", is he selling "water services"? <sep><sep> They were driven not by great passion but by a common vision, and between them they had a lot of tenderness. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In recent years, the pressure on our resources and pollution has increased due to the transformation of agriculture into tourism. <sep> <sep>Therefore, this is one of the most significant changes since 2008 when the Labour Act was replaced by the Employment Rights Act. <sep> <sep> Despite their different interests, as a social class, they understand the world differently. <sep> <sep> At the same time, capitalist forces must invest in peace and security, as well as in a large factory – to create jobs. <sep> <sep> And sadly, it could have been more than just a cosmetic role. <sep> <sep> We went to eat in the village of Azzun at the Mohamid J. <sep> <sep> Before they can enter into their 2-3 minute intervention: 'I thank the Prime Minister Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam' for the vision of the Prime Minister the First Minister has left a mark. <sep> <sep> when people criticize the private sector, like this in Worker's Choice Kader Sayed Hossen and Nita Deerpalsing, they denounce them as "drawing boards", while others like him, consider them "architects". <sep> <sep> We're not saying that sometimes people pretend in a stupid way: "Mow all thick, plant palm trees". <sep> <sep> After that, there was an open debate that followed the paper. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The infrastructure construction is complete, but I still have some doubts. <sep><sep> It is a political program that offers an alternative to the capitalist economy which is in crisis. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have successfully blocked the live ammunition shipments to the U.S base on Diego Garcia, for the reunification of the Republic of Mauritius, for the right to return and reparations for all Chagossians. <sep><sep> The government responded in a letter that it may impose its conditions on the expansion of its military base in exchange for the security industry providing the government with between 1,500 and 2,000 acres of land. <sep><sep> Similarly, there are still persisting issues on the global level. <sep><sep> Avoid a small wound, a torn cloth, all corrected. <sep><sep> But Australia no longer opposes the expansion of Diego Garcia, as it was renegotiating its naval agreement with the USA. <sep><sep> More than any other industry, the textile sector clearly embodies a historic formation of social classes in Mauritius: from feudal remnants to discriminatory recruitment practices, and significant income disparities at different levels. <sep><sep> The public is more concerned with the old Lalit, as an organization, has always had alternative paths to defend the program that it has always defended. <sep><sep> There are 3 members elected for the first time to the Central Committee, one from the East, one from the South, and one from the West. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We must listen to the subsidies on the cost of those items as well! <sep> Recently, when the SOFRES survey showed that 59% of the population favors the introduction of the Creole language in education, it shows that it is popularly demanded. <sep> It is possible that even if the MMM wins the election, the MSM will only get 8 seats. <sep> We continue to work in the same direction as Henri Favory, LALIT, Terre de Paix, Federasyon Playgroup, Grup Abaim, and all other individuals we are accustomed to working with to advance the mother tongue. <sep> It is visible in the IPP, in L'Express (BAI and PT vs Lestrac, Rogers, MCB, FAIL). <sep> Various solutions from the government: austerity plans dictated by the IMF, World Bank, and the European Central Bank. <sep> All this shows that it is an interesting but also dangerous period. <sep> Lastly, what about the economics (I am talking about real economics, not HSC economics)? <sep> Otherwise, it is mandatory to dedicate a sufficient proportion of arable land for food plantations to feed everyone in the country, like the law previously mandated during war times. <sep> The third element is the Collective Workforce, it is a union that is recognized and has signed agreements with employers, determining work conditions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, the IBA will not be able to control the pressure of these 10 forces that we have mentioned. <sep><sep> This catastrophism is giving everyone a bad conscience, encouraging individualistic laziness and preventing systemic crisis response. <sep><sep> The Lalit militants have been active in the Anti-Crime Movement since 1995. <sep><sep> When a new clean sector opens, you can get all new employees. <sep><sep> Q: Arvind Boolell, why did you say you have no political will? <sep><sep> Bolell answered,"No, you know your 40s. <sep><sep> Comrade Alain said that near the village they reached, there is a barrier where the Israeli army prevents villagers from crossing. <sep><sep> Will using it make us even more prisoners of the steel industry, rather than prisoners of the sugar industry? <sep><sep> Since the new regime came to power, we have found that the MSM/MMM electoral landslide only contained threats to increase communalism. <sep><sep> It was a moment that determined all the modern history of Chagos. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, this goes 10ft, you can plant whatever you want in it every year. <sep><sep> The economic crisis in Europe and around the world in the 1960s, it even came in the late 1969s and early 1970s, and it brought about the creation of the MMM. <sep><sep> In response to a supplementary question as to whether this is not a secondary issue, Ram Seegobin said that for 5 years, we have been running a campaign for an alternative economic policy to address the economic crisis. <sep><sep> We hope that through reflection and discussion on this book, this will encourage the development of clearer positions on language. <sep><sep> Lenin has another way of conserving this historical possibility in the example of the bourgeois ideology, which does not exclude Gramsci's method. <sep><sep> A more centralized and more vocal body, A.Subron even said in L'Express on June 6, 2010 'I would like to reassure the MSPA that the unions are in favor of productive activities for the country through sugar cane'. <sep><sep> Then, it's also saying that following the new laws' logic, 3 years ago we analyzed this, he says about the new ERA that the former NRB is supposed to disappear. <sep><sep> MMM and PMSD are not really even saying what effect they are looking for a point (no matter what point) where they can criticize the Government. <sep><sep> There is a family of 25 and children waiting for a gentleman who has passed Checkpoint. <sep><sep> They have shown a profound interest in the dynamics that different types of activities can bring in different areas through schooling and regional differences. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We reflect on where he comes from, and where he is going, this class is integral. <sep><sep> The dominant ideology tells you: if you go to school, do well in school, you will succeed. <sep><sep> And after this Hearing, it is LALIT that has the duty to turn the findings into a political victory. <sep><sep> why are there swimming pools for generation after generation that is coming after us. <sep><sep> For him, Omar had a lot of sensitivity and talent. <sep><sep> It appears that the government has spent only Rs50 million from that fund Rs. <sep><sep> Clearly Dr Surman has responded to his report so that it is like a response to Dr Ramstein's Report. <sep><sep> irrespective of problems faced by workers: it is not possible for a worker to work for 5 years, sometimes even more, before he is confirmed, before he gets a regular salary. <sep><sep> 2004 UNESCO LITERACY PRIZE AWARDED TO LEDIKASYON PU TKominike de Pres Lalit. <sep><sep> So, the women's movement is growing, not against men, no. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then he attacks Pravind Jugnauth and criticizes Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> Back to Chekpoynt, there is a road to go to Beita, Salfit region. <sep><sep> "When the massacre started, LALIT flew the flag of the issue with former president Uteem to demand that the Mauritian government cut diplomatic ties with Israel." <sep><sep> A systemic crisis means that there is a crisis everywhere because it is one. <sep><sep> He was questioning the mess we were in. <sep><sep> Then, big leader 'Berenger congratulated the unitary language of Pere Gregoire'. <sep><sep> In 2000, after the Seetulsing incident, when we finally got the Sachs Commission that was supposed to look at electoral reform, what did we find? <sep><sep> This press crisis was entirely predictable - for 20 years. <sep><sep> The Wanted Manifesto is trying to define "Mauritius" as including "Rodrigues, Agalega, ... (and so on, and so forth)". <sep><sep> Rada has been militating in associations like the Cooperative School since her youth, which began in the early student protest movements in May 1975. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They stop everyone just so they can beat him. <sep><sep> In Lalit Party, since 1982 we have been saying that we need to abolish the Communal Laspe in the bestloser system, because it is a system that perverts democracy. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we already have a program, facing a crisis, that we have developed "For an alternative economic policy." <sep><sep> So the detention in jail, the position in the civil service, it favors this kind of social mobility towards a kind of state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> But we have a responsibility to make sure we feed our family. <sep><sep> Boskalis Dimunn targeting; Chady, Mountthoora Economic Conurbation; Work on drainage in limestone. <sep><sep> How does the trade union movement respond to this transformation of essential services into commodities? <sep><sep> "I am here on a matter of principle," he said. <sep><sep> CTSP/FPU/FTU was at Laplas Taxi Beau Basin and JNP/GWF was at Reduit. <sep><sep> * I met an uncle who lives near the school. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, why it ended GWF here, until now, no one has heard any clear explanation. <sep> <sep> Today, neither the Ramgoolam government nor the opposition 'Remake 2000' have any political alternatives to propose for the economy or job creation. <sep> <sep> Even the river that used to nourish the land of Timi-Balram has become very dry. <sep> <sep> So the German, UK, and Italian armies have preferred to stay in their barracks, withdrawn. <sep> <sep> Already it is an extraordinary waste of resources where only encourages people to take advantage, to commit to its soil. <sep> <sep> The report also highlights the fact that there are serious ethno-religious parastatal that are directly financed by the Ministry of Religion and Culture. <sep> <sep> Xavier Duval described the PMSD as a party with a government culture and compared it to the MMM which he described as a party with a culture of opposition. <sep> <sep> Paul Berenger easily says "if we don't agree, let's go separate ways, then we'll see" <sep> <sep> Later, when I received information that we have no water problem in Mauritius, then I find that there won't be a revolution. <sep> <sep> And it is also important to understand the difference between trade unions and political parties. <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsey: In the world of classroom discussion, the only way to understand it is to listen carefully to it. <sep><sep> And it seems that they are talking a lot about politics in their studies. <sep><sep> This implies that the concept of job security has changed a lot because in the past when one lost their job, they had a pension which they would receive, whereas today they do not have one. <sep><sep> In any case, if it is a matter of "wording", we find that Paul Berenger has a serious vocabulary problem, given that since 1982 he has promised to change the IRA. <sep><sep> Rama Valayden has also announced that from now on, it is not just suspension that the police will face, but expulsion by force of the police. <sep><sep> The MLF has also stated that the Rape Crisis Unit should be opened in all regional hospitals, including in Rodrigues. <sep><sep> The open letter has gone through the post, by hand and by email. <sep><sep> Sithanen is proposing something that could integrate the best loser system into a party list. <sep><sep> This source is still valid, even today in the various laws across the world. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, over the past 2 years, Israel has continued its military attacks, bombings, assassinations, and repression against the Palestinians. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But I think Former President Cassam Utteem forgot to mention that, after that, the Prime Minister said "Hey, it's not Minister of Foreign Affairs who wrote this speech, it's me who wrote this speech!" In the end, that's his problem. <sep><sep> Maybe it will lead to conflict, otherwise a family feud or an explanation as to how one family works for another family entrepreneur. <sep><sep> Because we started before they knew, they still have no clue. <sep><sep> and not in their mother tongues Bhojpuri and Creole as originally intended. <sep><sep> Today, no duty has been weakened by imperialist US pressure. <sep><sep> The balance of power among the classes did not allow our resistance to go far. <sep><sep> Last year, Lalit members went to the World Social Forum and managed to raise questions to strengthen the military base. <sep><sep> The first thing people need to know in practice and law is that it's a crime. <sep><sep> Free transport for pensioners and school children (Lalit had proposed free transport for everyone right at the beginning, using the money saved from traveling), and promised diplomatic ties with Israel (Lalit's program and action). <sep><sep> How can we bring our fight for liberation closer for all families? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have come with visible and sometimes invisible measures. <sep><sep> Species of lizards that are difficult to find locally, there are protected species such as in Desbro. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee will give us a strategic insight for the launch of our campaign. <sep><sep> Some workers are not mobilizing to control their own union. <sep><sep> The Youth Commission held a session to analyze the United Nations Resolution that it signed, to put an end to the invasion of Lebanon by Israel. <sep><sep> Get "The History of a Betrayal", published by Lalit in 1987, the article on the "birth of a state bourgeoisie" where there are also explanations about the historical birth of the bourgeois class in the context of the struggle for independence, was discussing "association". <sep><sep> After having a meeting with us: we said if we 'start quarreling for this', we will also go that way. <sep><sep> Mauritius needs to develop an agricultural production market that is "Guaranteed GMO-FREE". <sep><sep> During that period, when working, most families were unclear about their deceased colleagues' situation, the police were beating them. <sep><sep> Then, the movement for the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace strengthened. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After eating, there was a second session on Moyenne Orean, which Kisna Kistnasamy has done. <sep> This practice by the police force (and there are historical, philosophical, social, political reasons for this) is especially against people found in lower social classes. <sep> One for the poor like us, another for capitalists trying to become foreign billionaires? <sep> It is because the Creole-speaking people in these social classes are mostly unconsciously shifting towards French (or "French-speaking") for formal resistance. <sep> This is what I want to say that we need to be practical, pragmatic, and realistic. <sep> It has its own rules. Profitability, productivity, profitability. <sep> The first concept we will look at is 'Mauritianism' exactly. <sep> Go see the counselor, contact all teams, hold meetings everywhere. <sep> This company has not paid any taxes for the last 4 to 5 years. <sep> Deputies have gathered evidence, conducted all sorts of studies, and finally agreed with Leung Shing's proposal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Political expressions conflict of class allow us to bring our campaign in a more political way than before when it becomes clear that different political parties represent different social classes, capitalist sections. <sep><sep> The Artisans and General Workers' Union and the Organization of Artisans Unity (artisan union, at the time Algoo and Rima.) - which articulates artisans with it. <sep><sep> And while the case is still in court on the house, accusations have been made that the lawyer has received house money as an honorarium. <sep><sep> Wednesday 17 April 1,200 Palestinian prisoners have triggered a hunger strike to protest against their extra-judicial detention by Israel, particularly in military prisons. <sep><sep> Then we have the right to condemn Israel as it should be condemned. <sep><sep> It is important to emphasize that Mauritius was absent when the UN voted on this resolution <sep><sep> - even saying that we keep our heads up for this WANTED: <sep><sep> Lawyers, judges, our special people. <sep><sep> They have organized a total labor strike for 8 days. <sep><sep> We have not sat with Solidarity Tent in Nabluz where a woman who was on a hunger strike died in the mosque last week. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Let this activity continue for several years - until it reaches the Selection Committee, gets compensation from the British government, and establishes a Trust Fund. <sep><sep> As for the Bidze concern on Friday, we find it's not just for Sithanen to be seeking points against his competitors Berenger and Pravind Jugnauth. <sep><sep> As his mother was very ill, he quickly became the head of the family: having to pay the monthly commission and buy groceries every month; what business to conduct every week; everyday, he had to prepare water for his father to wash his clothes in the bathroom; serve him his meals. <sep><sep> The trouble is not about any candidate due to the general marginalization of all forces that are not in these two suffering blocs. <sep><sep> Another hotel said, for the working class people, and they are taking illegal workers. <sep><sep> Comrade Deepa (from the audience): I wanted to ask Ram about his thoughts on the relationship between electricity and religion. <sep><sep> But now, we are at the beginning of a nutritional crisis, a global one. <sep><sep> So, what kind of political party is it? It is an organization that brings together a group of people - sometimes small, sometimes large - who all share the same political orientation, the same political vision. <sep><sep> He replied that the MSM-MMM government will not privatize water. <sep><sep> Or on the language issue: Navin Ramgoolam in favor of Kreol as a medium when he spoke at the Kreol Festival, Bunwaree announced its introduction as a medium in January 2010. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Performance of Morisian Original Music composed by Rajni Lallah (electric piano) along with vocalist Joelle Hosseny: The Sea. <sep><sep> This Conference was important, because many people are completely confused about what the strategy is, and what the tactics are, and what the maneuvering behavior is. <sep><sep> He said Government to distribute another 840 arpents that they had acquired from Tablisman. <sep><sep> Plant olive trees at the water level dividing line, half shared between the people who have become olive tree owners. <sep><sep> It is a fact that only a minority of people always advocate against imposing foreign languages on children in schools, in Parliament, and in the Registrar's office. <sep><sep> I only knew them from hearsay. <sep><sep> We start with the poem "Paper boat" by Alain Fanchon, which has become a title in the anthology. <sep><sep> After Mauritius sold Diego to the UK, is it now preparing to sell Diego to the US? <sep><sep> We find that for the past 6 months licenses have been handed out like candy. <sep><sep> Yesterday, G. Duval admitted in the press that Berenger has somewhat taken some of his supporters, a part of his electorate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, a program like the LALIT program, it's not like a tablet on a rose, meaning it has something heavy on it, right. <sep><sep> On Monday, there was a funeral (some were calling it a ceremony, others were calling it a procession). <sep><sep> Was there any negative outcome on this Friday evening? <sep><sep> We hope to find you in this watch of solidarity with Lebanon and Palestine. <sep><sep> The boss has repatriated 16 Bangladeshi workers who were leading in the strike organization. <sep><sep> Kamini places his hand on the Lorianne's horse's neck, sweat running down his forehead, giving him some water to drink. <sep><sep> Like he did before in our history. <sep><sep> And in fact, when we are talking about the CNT, when we find CNT workers in 5 different unions, 5 different federations, he wants to say that the first union in CNT is the one that must fight between them. <sep><sep> It is the launching of institutions that keep this minority with a monopoly on racist means towards everyone. <sep><sep> There has been a second way to reproduce the elite through dirty colleges. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a lot of corruption when people use the language. <sep><sep> If the Minister does not intervene, you can file a complaint. <sep><sep> Why in the last 2-3 bananas, all these youngsters are trying to leave for Ireland, Australia, and France? <sep><sep> So, workers are suffering a lot because of the crisis and because of the lost economy. Prices are increasing, the cost of living is increasing. <sep><sep> He cannot buy only what he produces, he cannot buy or use what other products produce. <sep><sep> Apart from that, he can manage.' - 'Did you drink something? Have you finished eating?' Sami asked him. <sep><sep> A neoliberal economy says that the State should not interfere with its business. <sep><sep> In the last 2 weeks more than 300 Palestinians have lost their lives in the air and tank attacks by the Israelis. <sep><sep> This series of crises has been cushioned somewhat in Mauritius, by a series of factors: China is coming with a big investment of a billion dollars through the Jin Fei company. <sep><sep> Three armored ships and a dozen large police vans. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before discussing the Creole and Bhojpuri language, before insulting people's mother tongue, they could at least reflect on whether they are not suffering from the "arrogance of ignorance" syndrome. Because indeed, they are devoting their total ignorance to the last 30-50 years of research on language issues. <sep><sep> This could lead to a massive uproar for women who have lost their jobs in France due to the closure of the lizinn factory, as the establishment has given women in the labor force VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme). <sep><sep> Meaning similar to a system where there is class inequality, where a tiny capitalist minority has its bosses, and sub-bosses in the middle class, and at the bottom, a majority of workers who have no decision-making power; <sep><sep> They presented 70 photos of what they visited in Venezuela and Cuba, and while they used photos to illustrate their report, they also evaluated and analyzed what they found there. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, every time there is a talk about food production, politicians don't know why the size keeps changing. <sep><sep> Here in Lalit, there is pleasure in providing an answer to this question, and it can serve as an introduction to the Marxist Economics course that Lindsey will conduct. <sep><sep> So he went to ask them another question. <sep><sep> The New Workers' Movement System has organized themselves to work as a collective team, instead of as individuals. <sep><sep> - Why do we still have strict colonialism in the ownership and usage of agricultural land? <sep><sep> It could be worse than 1929, where capitalism had not yet fully emerged, to become another beast as it is now. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have pleasure in giving you a copy when the session ends. <sep><sep> They had a "guide" - meaning militants from the youth section of the Unified Socialist Party of Venezuela who accompanied them during their visit to Venezuela. <sep><sep> AKM proposed that the government go to MCA to make a program. <sep><sep> This work is being undertaken in a sub-committee of the Academy of African Languages, ACALAN. <sep><sep> The clash between PTR and MMM with Ramgoolam saying MMM, at least, has a political culture that MSM does not have. <sep><sep> Ally Hosenbokus explained how in Lalit it is easier for young people to contribute to all strict party because there is no patriarchal or macho leader preventing young people from expressing themselves. <sep><sep> But in other countries, there have been no progressive political parties that have survived. <sep><sep> Finally, Les Verts, who spoke out against Bill, did not even vote against the law, but only abstained. <sep><sep> When closing the base, the United States and the United Kingdom need to ensure environmental sustainability. <sep><sep> It has been condemned for setting up this secondary party in an alliance, this junior partner; but for that, in a sense, it has too much support. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It's not because Shakeel Mohamed is a rich man, as some unionists say. <sep> <sep> I will sign the document, but we must meet at 10 Downing Street. <sep> <sep> He recalls that this French law was introduced from crime to become a delicacy in 1923 in France. <sep> <sep> In this situation, with the impending elections, for this First May it is an opportunity for us to examine how a crisis situation can be mobilized enough, understood a program in common, so that on the basis of this program - in our sector, our fields - we reaffirm support for LALIT and our politics. <sep> <sep> Some workers are doing double work or are taking part in work, selling this, selling that. <sep> <sep> It dates back to 1810 and was only copied into law in 1838. <sep> <sep> We also lay down rights for all functionaries to do political activities (until P.A.S.). <sep> <sep> Open letter explaining how Lalit differs from other parties in this election and the value of each vote for Lalit. <sep> <sep> Interesting debate on the role of International (volunteers from other countries coming to help) in Palestine. <sep> <sep> He has a good call to coordinate the actions of the working class as a whole. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the second part of Political Education, we watched a film called "Tragedy in the Holy Land: The Second Uprising". <sep> <sep> It is under popular pressure that America has had to close down its military bases in places like Subic Bay (the Philippines), Vieques (Puerto Rico), and other places where people have mobilized. <sep> <sep> On the environmental front, our Environmental Commission has prepared a specific program. <sep> <sep> - Here in Mauritius, at the All Workers’ Conference - against privatization, against the MAI, against the WTO, against the various aspects of the WTO agreements, etc. <sep> <sep> 'I love my dad my mom, he loves me.' - 'But why doesn't he marry you?' - 'I don't want to get married. <sep> <sep> It is not something invented by Karl Marx or even Paul Berenger. <sep> <sep> Because out of the 45,000 workers who are laid off, the employers have given them a social plan, money and a piece of land. <sep> <sep> *His election is a victory against state militarism and particularly against wars in Iraq. <sep> <sep> It has come to this as a result of a long process of expropriation in the past. <sep> <sep> Comrade Vijay: So when there is this issue of combating communalism, there is another thing, there must be meritocracy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Resistance did not review the Bestluzer system question at all, and in any case because the United Nations Human Rights Committee does not mandate how a country should organize its electoral system. <sep><sep> And for the rise of the new economic powers such as India and China. <sep><sep> As for this LPT hearing, it has cleared all "accounts" nicely. <sep><sep> Even if we feel it is 1 in a million. <sep><sep> They promised an electoral reform with a round table announcement, but all of that disappeared without eliminating the communal Bestluzer system. <sep><sep> In fact, from its inception, the WSF has excluded all political organizations, creating a divide between social and political spheres. <sep><sep> Then, in Zen 79, something, an event, will trigger a strike. <sep><sep> This paper was presented by Ram Seegobin at the International Seminar Lalit 25 Zin, 2006 <sep><sep> He recalled his own experiences when he got involved and wrote a lot, how he gained confidence in himself, and how his vision grew more acute and profound. <sep><sep> They are trying to make pensions sound like a certainty. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And everyone knew that from then on the Disik Protocol he will have to be restrictive to become WTO-compatible. <sep> If Ashok Subron was still in Lalit today, there is no doubt that the union leaders would have accepted him in this bureaucracy. <sep> This evening, March 2006, (Rama showing it in the Press Conference) there are 4 major slogans that we have put. <sep> Raddhoa was decorated in Reduit, he was also decorated in a post-imperial way. <sep> What ignorance? On the contrary, the school is succeeding in corrupting them with its bizarre ideas. <sep> And we also notice that even these democratic rights, are often arbitrary. <sep> This defines the difference between a slave and a modern worker. <sep> You have found the team that these two Alliances bring: like a pack of cards: beat, cut, redistribute. <sep> and together they agree to eliminate a fringe benefits are excluded from something promised, it will be binding for all workers? <sep> Read the article by Ragini Kistnasamy and Lindsey Collen (page 109) on this lalit of which ordinary people, especially women, have brought to our country when they have defied authority. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is also an advantage for launching foreign languages at the pre-university level. <sep><sep> Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, which sold houses, a bank called Bear Stearns, and now AIG, an insurance company, one of the largest in the world. <sep><sep> We deplore the fact that Bidze's Speech did not mention any reference to law reforms. <sep><sep> It is just a such program that can establish true equity. It is within the framework of the demands of the trade unions that this claim must be developed. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin began by saying that today's struggle is part of a historical development of LALIT. <sep><sep> That's how it has offered a programmatic alliance with the working class. <sep><sep> There have been testimonies from parents, students, school teachers, linguists, students, representatives from Rodrigues organizations in the field of education, as well as from LALIT members. <sep><sep> At the same time as the Police are pursuing Lindsey Collen, we are now witnessing a systematic denigration campaign against this LALIT activist by "former socialist militants". <sep><sep> So this year, we found the importance of becoming more aware of our political "strategies", on the importance of a political program. <sep><sep> And the practical conclusion of his proposal is, military base talks on Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government must provide funds to build boats that can go to Ban, so that the fishermen of Mauritius can reach the areas with fish. <sep><sep> When we start with the patriarchal victims, mobilize to support them, it's a way so that we can take action, mobilize on the basis of our demand for the decriminalization of prostitution, on the basis of our political program. <sep><sep> The socialist power we are trying to bring here, it must be brought by the working class, when it's fighting for its rights. <sep><sep> There are the Association des Femmes Mauriciennes, La Ligue Feministes, Muvman Liberasyon Fam and Mauritius Alliance of Women. <sep><sep> Is Navin Ramgoolam trying to create his "Jugnauth State" for himself? <sep><sep> He does this with his good intentions, according to them. <sep><sep> When did the struggle for power really begin within Mauritian society? <sep><sep> The MMM has taken on the role that the PMSD used to play a long time ago, representing the city and the "minority" community. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth, on the other hand, says he can easily get 5.1%. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we realize that we need to develop political actions that go further than the dictates of the bourgeoisie, and to continually question it. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, it is our responsibility to make people aware of the options available and how they differ. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is not surprising that the Labour Party did not protest much against the new law at that time: they found that they also had advantages in it, mostly. <sep><sep> But the guards were slow in coming back with licenses to feed the popular nests. <sep><sep> Play by Henri Favory Re-Edit Pieces of theater Play was re-edited by Editions l'Ocean Indien. <sep><sep> In addition, the working class has another reason to come to power: to save the planet from destruction by the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> They favor small-scale production somewhat openly rather than a power struggle by the working class. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, IPP/CEB signed in 1998 on Ramgoolam himself gave full guarantee to the Security Industry to enter the production chain by using bags and carbon. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Worker's biggest "political strategy", Christian Rivalland, who understood so much the ways in which the worker's power has, has died, also leaving a void that risks destabilizing the workers a bit. <sep><sep> But the serious thing is that X.Duval and the full support of the government N.Ramgoolam are making it a rather sectoral celebration. <sep><sep> According to our analysis of a "new social conscience", it is exactly counter to the "class struggle". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And Sachs received instructions to undertake a major reform of the electoral system where the Best Loser question should not be included. <sep> What happened to my mom? - 'Don't lift the sheet. <sep> People like Mathieu Lacle, Nono Lee Cheong Lem, Amedee Darga, Bashir Khodabux, etc. <sep> Mobilization and revolt in the Middle East, especially in Tunisia, Libya, Syria, and Bahrain, are changing the balance of power against the Zini government and its allies. <sep> In a serious economic crisis like the one we are facing today, Alain has mentioned that it is important to carry forward this ideological battle and bring the political struggle to the forefront, with an understanding of how to incorporate social and union struggles into it. <sep> Initially, this CT Power project involved the construction of a power plant by Malaysian capital with CEB as a minor shareholder. <sep> that is to say making the “cane sector” into the “sugar sector” and making it profitable. <sep> but we are committed to a political struggle based on a program that is against the occupation of Palestine, for the liberation of the Chagos Islands, and for a campaign for an alternative economic policy. <sep> demanding an 8-hour workday and better working conditions. <sep> They were very interested in learning more about the Chagos and the US military base on Diego Garcia, as well as the Chagosians and other issues in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Why is it that poor people are arrested and imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread, while big thieves roam free? <sep><sep> The working class in Mauritius will not take it lying down. <sep><sep> They want to see massive employment destruction in this country. <sep><sep> Without going into great detail, can you tell me, through newspapers, advertisements, TV, can you tell me what kind of laundry detergent the population, the workers are using? <sep><sep> He says that with the 3 arpents of land that he has obtained from the Regional Government, he plans to produce 100,000 bananas by the end of December this year. <sep><sep> MMM sells its policies of equality and anti-communalism. <sep><sep> But what will happen is formal resistance in parliament to explain quickly. <sep><sep> Many people in the working class know all these punishments that are happening. <sep><sep> But, by the time of Ut 79, it became a duel. <sep><sep> For half a century, he raised his five children, worked as a house painter, and at the same time secured a place in the collective memory, in the history of Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the legal framework of the WTO (the body that finances world capital), it makes it illegal to continue this constant training of a bigger bourgeoisie, by facilitating it from the State. <sep><sep> Another example, just with hearing that LPT organized to understand what makes a child lose its mother tongue, what do we find? <sep><sep> And they were negotiating to get a specific social plan, a compensation when they were dismissed. <sep><sep> In other words, the fact that our country is different from most other countries in the world, is due to the fact that it has established strict social classes from birth itself, in order to call to the international capitalist system, in particular, to provide distinct services to England, and then Europe. <sep><sep> The illegitimate dictatorship regime must go and be replaced by a provisional government that includes the National Alliance for Democracy, which was democratically elected in the last general elections in 1990, and won 80 percent of the vote. <sep><sep> Dany Marie wrote a poem about the importance of language. <sep><sep> 2000: Candidate position against MMM-MSM (Medpoint) and against PT-PMSD. <sep><sep> Sometimes these processes forecast something that has already happened in the past (like a cyclone a week before a major flooding) or a distant earthquake that has caused a tsunami. <sep><sep> If you do not agree with what Ziz has understood, you can make a call. <sep><sep> A great upheaval that goes through every person's mind. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He understands that in this system, in the way that different actors come in and out, play, joke, create illusions, he understands that this system he sees is to make the lives of Mauritian children miserable everywhere, because it is not national. <sep><sep> It is to set in our minds, to work for us to have an understanding of how we find things. <sep><sep> Another thing is that precisely ` with the woman's consent or not ` that shows that there were forced abortions at that time. <sep><sep> Apart from the beach and Balram's plantation, the blood had continued to flow within the mud. <sep><sep> There was a modord siyn option form, either you sign, don’t hurry, or don't delay. <sep><sep> Last time, it was Linlay Marthe, a globally renowned bassist who left. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, in the past, we had Revi, we had the newspaper (more than 100 newspapers, once a week), and we had other publications. <sep><sep> When we experienced a food crisis, we made it to a Food Security Fron 3 in Desela, a Fron with 10 organizations, the way we saw it was clearly to expose the system that produces this crisis. <sep><sep> Then from 1988, we had Revi LALIT, it also lasted a month. <sep><sep> an award that UNESCO gives to organizations that significantly contribute to literacy for everyone to read and write well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Similarly, many people in the "Occupy Wall Street" movement today are saying they don't want a program because if they achieve victory, there is a risk of demobilization. <sep> There are LCR turning into NPA and LO merging with PT which is now calling itself POI, there is an International Agreement with its secretariat in San Francisco. <sep> We decided to stay in case of a military attack in the villages. <sep> It has notably resurrected the memory of Alain Ah-Vee, who co-chaired the launch, who went to Palestine in 2004 and notably Ragini Kistnsamy who went to Palestine twice. <sep> In September 2001, a new evolution, the real coup, not only the Mauritian State did not back the US base, but it finds it necessary in the US campaign against "terrorism". <sep> When you go looking to understand if you're going to get a problem. <sep> And to fight for a freer and more equal society, where there will be no need for repression. <sep> Not only was there a lack of nurses in hospitals; not only did he shoulder certain social responsibility, but now he had to take on a new life in his belly. <sep> But, we said to VRS, besides giving a goal to rebuild a house, and a week later, gave it a goal to exploit it by planting something. <sep> At the same time, Zizman Lakur Siprem draws attention to the official illegality sworn by 2 out of 3 Prime Ministers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, the demands for a more advanced Welfare State, for better schools, free and accessible healthcare, improved pension systems, good laws for everyone, these demands are necessary. <sep> In 2006, LALIT supported MLF's demand for a Rape Crisis Unit, a request that had been initiated by a member of LALIT. <sep> In the Government of the Alliance Socialiste, we found a political line that defends the capitalist sections that are the strongest, namely the historical bourgeoisie, as well as the imperialism that is the strongest in the world. <sep> And also, for the first time in a trio, we have Jhonny Joseph, Steve Desveaux and Rajni Lallah playing several instrumental compositions. <sep> When a political line wants to fight in an opportunist way against communalism, this happens. <sep> It is not surprising that people say, "Tell me to go to hell, I'll come back pumped up" or find all kinds of ways, be it in alcohol, or in other ways, that will get them out of it. <sep> ONI is beginning to recognize a Palestinian State, even if Israel does not agree. <sep> Even the Education Regulations of 1957, as reactionary as they are on language policies, do not completely ban the Creole language. <sep> At that time, a column existed that had an intimate relationship with a female worker under wage labor (at that time there was "chokra chokri" who were working, meaning children). <sep> When Rajni Lallah was on the Radio One program, he had to speak very carefully about it, while Ram Seegobin was on a Radio One program of the same size. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So when we are building a political movement, because it is our only way to confront power, our only way to do what the times demand, <sep><sep> means that when we bring a struggle against capitalism, the women's movement has an interest in questioning, for example, the fact that women do not have control over this land that feeds us. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have seen enough mobilization in the past to force the Mauritian government to come out of this inertia, this passivity, and to make it act with a little more courage, a little more conviction, a little more integrity. <sep><sep> "Wow, correct!" Recognize that power, it is terribly important. <sep><sep> These various mechanizations have been made, without considering the future of employment in Mauritius at all. <sep><sep> But certainly what is clear is that Europe is trying to strengthen its position in WTO negotiations that will have significant implications. <sep><sep> There are 74 barriers and electrified barbed wire or concrete barriers ranging from 1.8 km to 16.3 km at controlled access points. <sep><sep> PMSD in the 70's and 80's for example is not the same as today's government. <sep><sep> MMM took to the streets, despite the fact that it, like the Alliance Sociale government, is against its anti-worker policy. <sep><sep> And certainly comrade Rajni will continue, will provide a programmatic continuity which reflects what Lalit has done and also past experiences. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The family has not evolved with the new generation, so there are many clashes. <sep> Last year, there was a meeting of all the organizations that were part of the Front to protest against the imperialist and militarist policies of Bush. <sep> But an analysis in Palestine reveals that these colonies are being used as outposts to make money. <sep> Mauritius is protesting against Greenpeace for the Seafood Hub, and the government does not want to get involved. <sep> However, the policies imposed by Sithanen and Boolell have led to a fundamental contradiction within the Labor Party itself. <sep> They will have more interest in sharing their wealth with the party, or going deeper into their homes. <sep> Vinesh Hookoomsing has work with his Spelling Committee. <sep> But in the last year, when he was absent for a long time for reasons not well known, this, along with political-financial scandals, weakened him and he seems to have lost his grip on the situation. <sep> "If they had taken the measures we proposed, we could have been better prepared to face the financial crisis and global economic crisis," Lindsey Collen said. <sep> LALIT is not sectarian, as it was taken over at one point in 2006, there was a meeting with Monseigneur Piat on mother tongue in schools, and on education reform. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are grand nationalists stirring up flags, national pride, and imperialist parasites from all sides, and the nationalists are rejoicing. <sep><sep> Trotsky's line had suffered a defeat in a Congress in 1926, and a year later he was expelled from the Third International. <sep><sep> When we look at these indicators, it is interesting to look at the reasons behind this. <sep><sep> We have received proposals from Lalit for a quota system, to discuss if it can bring about this general improvement. <sep><sep> If there are implications for only 23 people, if it will go well, it is for you to predict, to make a judgment. <sep><sep> Especially if in the upcoming elections, the MSM has been weakened and marginalized. <sep><sep> You would believe that when two young people are getting married, you would wish them well in their lives. <sep><sep> But, when there was a large series of debates "Lalit de Klas vs nationalists" organized by a somewhat "illegal" entity (in the sense that without approval from 4 of its regions, MMM called it "the gateway to Lwi," Lalit de Klas emerged victorious. <sep><sep> Pressure must be exerted against Israel, especially through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. <sep><sep> This is what UNESCO and all this modern research is saying. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The little girl and her two younger brothers grew up without difficulties. <sep> <sep> On Saturday, the 28th of February, during his press conference, Paul Berenger talked about the "common misdemeanors" on the radio as a means to signal the prohibition of piracy and only simple broadcasts and live interventions. <sep> <sep> In essence, there has been a realization that when there is sufficient trust, cooperation, knowledge, and experience to work together in the sector, then it is the capitalists who possess and control the companies that become "larger". <sep> <sep> Once again, he is beginning to do what LALIT has been saying should be done for a long time. <sep> <sep> One for Cat Born, one doesn't know where to go, and one for Bo Basin. <sep> <sep> 2 In the Cathedral of Jericho, there is a special ceremony to celebrate the ordination of a new priest. <sep> <sep> Throughout their health, they were continuously spreading this lie of being one people, one nation. <sep> <sep> The union is cooperating for him to continue to make a profit. <sep> <sep> If you are not happy, then, he says, there may be a different political decision. <sep> <sep> So the bourgeoisie led a class war, from a point of a class oppressed life, until it becomes overpowering. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, they have no interest in ensuring that workers are properly regulated to oversee what is happening in the workplace. <sep><sep> Everywhere this 5-dunam land (1 hectare equals 4 dunam) has olive trees. <sep><sep> The composition of these 2 Alliances makes it clear that it is a very cynical opportunism that has determined the sharing of tickets and either the candidates. <sep><sep> This election took place in 2006 Raphael Correa (and his party in a front called PAIS). <sep><sep> He will want to present a document to prove that he is no more than a certain sum, which he himself has fixed at Rs 20,000 per month, then he will give a pension. <sep><sep> You have to cross pots to pull pots and then you can hold fire." For them, it is the crossed pot that is the real cause of all their problems. <sep><sep> The ladrwat ideology says "Let's stop talking about equality, let's talk about 'equality of chances' instead". <sep><sep> Likewise, in a certain sense, the central idea in all important philosophies: to call it an emergence, and it says, when something new is being born, it is emerging. <sep><sep> He uses several methods, today we are looking at one of these methods: by dividing people on the basis of identity, on the basis of communal, religious, ethnic. <sep><sep> He also knew that there were beans that were not good to eat but that gave a hard time when they were cooked. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is an apprenticeship that we are doing by observing militants like Rajni, Ram or Lindsey, and this apprenticeship takes time. <sep><sep> So, it is not out of nostalgia that we commemorate it. <sep><sep> * Let us move forward with an agri-reform where democratic control is placed on land use to curb speculation, land grabbing, and agricultural land degradation. <sep><sep> When we attended the conference, he was not in favor of integrating with that group. <sep><sep> based on the studies in universities and the feedback from students on the quality of experiences they have in everyday life in society. <sep><sep> And so, in the USSR, a clash emerged between Marxism and natural sciences (including ecology) since 1930. <sep><sep> When comrade Shabeela Kalla was pursued for illegal activities in 2009, we stood by her. <sep><sep> She has become relatively stable, with a natural evolution. <sep><sep> Subjectively, in Mauritius, so far, the working class is still torn between the two forces that go against their interests: <sep><sep> and he says that in his program, the priority is the workers and in his Government Program, he says that the priority should be the nationalization of major capital. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that as long as we don't talk about what we believe, there shouldn't be any consequences in the future. <sep><sep> One of the greatest developments in 2011 is that we have become more aware of the importance of "Revive LALIT." <sep><sep> In response to this situation, at the level of LALIT we have had consistency in development and popularizing our political program that aims to strengthen the working class, so that the working class can become empowered. <sep><sep> They will also address certain tasks such as "territorial threat". <sep><sep> And in France's favorite, Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK) has also had to withdraw due to a moral issue bordering on criminality. <sep><sep> We say to introduce the mother tongue in all these areas. <sep><sep> and people who are protesting against the closing of free zones in France, against police brutality by Radooa and its men, and against the POTA law. <sep><sep> At the LALIT level since '84, and even before that, we had found that the imbalance in our dependence on diesel, on exports based on the good seas. <sep><sep> We include democratic demands, as well as economic and political ones. <sep><sep> A lady was telling how she had left her mother, who is 85, to go to Nablus. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Putting pressure on the need for an extra parliamentary position during the 2010 election campaign. <sep><sep> And they mean that many people are taking part in leaps and bounds from this base. <sep><sep> Like many colonized countries, Sri Lanka has strictly enforced administrative rules for over 140 years of British rule, which have fostered and encouraged favoritism, division, and tension among different sections of the population. <sep><sep> The more repression and militarized society, the more violence. <sep><sep> So, they think they need to catch up behind us. <sep><sep> With the TUTF the State has successfully gained control over trade union activities. <sep><sep> In the last 20 years only 7 - 8 new States have been created by either international law or local law. <sep><sep> So, it is not saying that he is imposing this kind of racket. <sep><sep> So, on Sunday, there tends to be a normal day. <sep><sep> Then they set up this flexible system, a large flexible new law and order system, all of that, in England, first large capitalist law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This year, in Cancun, Lalit initiated several actions: namely a with the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Parliament on GATS and social rights. <sep><sep> He has the money to keep himself in the meantime as a political party. <sep><sep> And then, some parties in the world have embraced this extreme liberalism. <sep><sep> It is Ramgoolam-Berenger-Jugnauth who are finally responsible if today there is a repressive regime in the Telecom sector. <sep><sep> Under the Labour Act, if an employer wants to dismiss a worker, he must pay the worker severance pay. <sep><sep> The Finance Minister started his speech by saying that there are very serious problems for Mauritius where the East is discord and the textile industry, and he even acknowledges these problems. <sep><sep> Without any accidents behind pretty things he was condemning the practice of racism in Jericho. <sep><sep> However, if a survey were to be conducted in France, many French people would have to steal their family because they do not have 22 square meters. <sep><sep> Since 1983, we in LALIT have taken the first action to expose the ridiculous loophole of the Best Loser System. <sep><sep> A systemic crisis, it is different from an ordinary crisis because it threatens the continuity of society in its existing form: it can provoke a rebellion, either barbarism or a political revolution so complete that it manages to create a new power, reorganize the economy in a different way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This year marks the return to the process to make the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace, the demilitarisation of the Indian Ocean, and the dismantling of the Diego Garcia base. <sep><sep> It is necessary to develop its counterpart: understanding feminine, plural femininity. <sep><sep> Despite the resignation of Seetulsing in 2000, when the MMM-MSM government established the Saachs Commission on electoral reform, it explicitly excluded whistleblowers from the work of that commission. <sep><sep> All of this is symptomatic of an unstable system, a systemic crisis. <sep><sep> Even a new sector like BPO, it is also dependent on capital from Europe. <sep><sep> There will be a large gathering of TUCP on November 7 to ratify the strike on December 10. <sep><sep> An American professor at the Foreign Policy Institute in the United States, who said that the capitalist system is the most advanced system that has ever existed, is also completely discredited. <sep><sep> All of these facts can be published on the web. <sep><sep> When we read about Ms. Nandini Soornack and her partner in business, Mr. Gooljaury, we perceive it as a divergence. <sep><sep> This lady was paralyzed in her body and mind. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (a) It is essential for all food items to have a label stating "GMO-FREE". <sep><sep> The government should start organizing all sectors for the entry of new plants. <sep><sep> Its level is not good, it is unworkable, and it has become ridiculous for everyone. <sep><sep> Every eleven o'clock, Sandia and Yosi would meet once a week where Sandia and Yosi lived. <sep><sep> For Lalit, this new curriculum also uses a sound balloon to test people's reactions when the whip is on the mother tongue, and Lalit also does not understand how politicians. <sep><sep> At that time, in Italy and Germany (and in a lesser degree in the UK and USA as well), when financial capital was in power for the first time and causing serious crises. <sep><sep> Maybe when Vijay Makhan, then when we hear Paul Berenger to see what happened, he says they did not delegate anyone. <sep><sep> Bourgeois ideology, they use this concept of meritocracy, which often people use as a tool against communalism, but to justify inequality. <sep><sep> Later, if it was a sign of democratic decline, it ordered campaigns to expose dangerous communal parties like MDN, PPM, FPM, Front for Justice, FSM. <sep><sep> What Paul Berenger represented those three motion which light, Aneerood Jugnauth and Kader Bayat presented in 1979, after the great strike of workers in the Sugar Industry and GWF. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this situation, we have a government that is more and more on the defensive, more and more discredited. <sep><sep> So, even if you are representing workers and farmers, when you are sitting on the Board, the logic of that Board is to declare failure. <sep><sep> It's then that Ashok Subron's name as the only technical adviser to sit on the GWF on behalf of CAWU. <sep><sep> He has had a hidden agenda for a long time. <sep><sep> Class struggle used to exist as a tendency in MMM and also in the form of a Revival, the revival of Class Struggle, which was a platform for bringing MMM back to the ground of class struggle, a class struggle for socialism. <sep><sep> Production has made great progress, but on the economic side people are struggling, most of the time. <sep><sep> LALIT has no problem with the trade union movement, there is a healthy relationship between LALIT and the trade union movement. <sep><sep> It has an idea where workers are, where people are enslaved rather than being aware of what they are de facto. <sep><sep> In despair, there are people turning to games and gambling. <sep><sep> You notice, therefore, that there is a problem with this belief, this theory, that the law comes out of the book of God. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> In the last month, the Canadian ambassador to the US found himself in a position where he was forced to conduct a mailing campaign against Fox News. <sep><sep> Berenger, on the other hand, did not miss the opportunity to mention "my good friend", namely Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> There were rumors, shortly after the election, where it was reported that the government had carried out a crackdown when the UWP Government made Aneerood Jugnauth deliver a speech in front of a hostile and confrontational audience and his Labour Party supporters, at Place du Quai. <sep><sep> There is a certain democratic control on MBC where, once every 5 years, elected members can be removed. <sep><sep> What is more interesting, he quickly unfolded his plan, the sardar makes himself king, securing his personal fortress, he goes home with a peaceful period, promising good times ahead to make sure he gets work in the next year. <sep><sep> Even before the discussion began with an introduction by Catherine Boudet for the Popular University, there was already a controversy. <sep><sep> This was because his regime, led by the Communist Party, had refused to liberalize its economy and give in to international capitalists. <sep><sep> If you want to learn, contact Lalit by phone at 208 2132. <sep><sep> According to Advance Rules, only "Indo-Mauritians" are allowed to be members, which means that Indo-Mauritians who do not practice a religion are excluded. <sep><sep> However, the situation worsens as the tourism sector is struggling, with 1,200 dockworkers losing their jobs, while transport workers are facing difficulties due to their companies closing down. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Starting from Lalit's Social Alliance, MMM faces many difficulties. <sep> And Paloma cannot make good decisions because as there are many forces acting upon her, it seems that Diego is starting to influence her. <sep> Then in L'Express 6 Ut 2010, it is stated that A. Subron says, 'I want to reassure the MSPA that the unions are in favor of productive activities for the country through sugarcane...'. <sep> LALIT presents Rada Kistnasamy as a candidate for parcel No.8. <sep> But in the minds of the population, the government and the opposition were both seen as accomplices. <sep> Cyril Monty highlighted that it is the poor and middle class who will suffer from this price increase. <sep> Even where it was hoped it would slow, growth has slowed, as in Lasinn and Lenn. <sep> Nilou and Prem did everything to make their married life not good. <sep> Deciding if we look at it, as we looked at it in the morning for the paper Lindsey - and Ram also found this - reality transcends its class, if what we are experiencing on our website is reality, it means, its reality. <sep> I think today we will discuss this in detail in the paper Lindsey, meaning I will not go too far on that. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These corporations making life-and-death decisions, treating them as if they were mere data, in universities. <sep><sep> The most troubling thing that has happened from this economic crisis is that people are being abandoned without any safety net. <sep><sep> We cannot know, in the future, what kind of derivatives may exist in the State, which will own and control all that data. <sep><sep> More than a thousand forums and debates in neighborhoods, schools, universities, and fields, before the Referendum to see if people will agree with the proposals contained in these 444 clauses. <sep><sep> In 1996, the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. <sep><sep> Last year, they were all sitting at the Central Committee and Political Bureau level. <sep><sep> It is this global protest movement that is growing, including in Mauritius, which has successfully set an example for a Minister and a certain number of so-called Third World countries to resist dictators in countries like China and Europe. <sep><sep> Lalit condemns the arrest of Neta Golan and supports the actions being taken by the Free Gaza Movement to break the siege of Gaza and prevent Israel from continuing its collective punishment against the people of Gaza. <sep><sep> For this reason, in the Strategic Conference, we developed an analysis showing concepts such as Mauritianism and national unity, social consciousness - old and new. <sep><sep> - The position of LALIT and Bizlall (MPM) on the Rogers-Air Mauritius scandal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You'll never be in a lord 1, 2, 3. <sep><sep>Ashok Jugnauth is called, Private Council of the Queen, there they confirmed indeed Supreme Court. <sep><sep> There is a certain weight, when he enters the class the size is. <sep><sep>LALIT also deplores the collaboration that exists between the police forces in Mauritius and the imperialist American military forces. <sep><sep>Roland Fozoo and Devianand Narrain stated in their deposition that the police arrested them at Mr. and Mrs. Macque's house and took them to Rose Belle station. <sep><sep> At that time we were expecting a vampire crisis. <sep><sep>If you listen to them, it's as if there is no hope of there being unity in Jericho," Fatma added. <sep><sep> and when old workers are retiring, young people are recruited, in a constant way, there is a transmission of the experiences of those who have long been involved in the struggle at the level of the site, in the union, they have often participated in a strike. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin explained on "industrial relations" and how the bourgeois state has sought to either weaken or outright repress trade unions through legislation and institutions that govern industrial relations. <sep><sep> Their way of working has made us more distant from the trade union movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is when you start to realize that there are many other institutions involved: the family, the media, schools. <sep><sep> In Chapter 3, which was presented by Emilie, Mandel (1) explains the difference between dominant ideology and revolutionary ideology. <sep><sep> We bring some food, and we share it together. <sep><sep> And we're not saying we have to go and convince bureaucracy, because the issue is what brings fragmentation. <sep><sep> It was not necessary to refuse to respect international law, on the contrary, the Supreme Court of his own country. <sep><sep> There are LALIT and LPT and, also in an important measure, a Playgroup, then another measure, organizations like Abaim, Terre de Paix, and individuals like Dev Virahsawmy and Henri Favory and his team. <sep><sep> And when we organized the International Conference for the Abolition of All International Military Bases, which took place in Ecuador in March 2007. <sep><sep> We also asked the question "What is the bourgeoisie state, what exactly does 'democratization of the economy by Navin Ramgoolam' mean? <sep><sep> There are even lumpen who support the Lalyans Sosyal when it's in the government, especially through Rama Valayden. <sep><sep> Felix, he makes a 10% profit, 7-8 people per worker, 1000 people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A true question is whether this ready-to-wear love that has come between you, which grows as you only understand all your differences, and reduce you to mechanical dolls that can parade on the same respectable catwalk. <sep><sep> There is, for example, this tendency for the PT-PMSD Government to fall into a form of repression - against the press, against unions, against all opponents - by taking it over. <sep><sep> Because in 2 years there is a new group that is - to put it mildly - leading, and they have a different orientation from time to time, in the way they look at the reality. <sep><sep> We took a position to criticize a petition organized by UNRAW-SPEAK, which we felt was giving the USA more power, even on the other side of Chagos, except for Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Acting as if the problem does not exist and the problem by force must be solved. <sep><sep> This is why when Balram mentioned a civil marriage he was against it. <sep><sep> However, the Mauritian Government has not made any progress on the issue of sovereignty (which we rather find, and more precisely and systematically as DECOLONIZATION AND RE-UNIFICATION). <sep><sep> Once again, it is based on the reality in which people are living. <sep><sep> This leads to a funny situation: If the beating is "proportional" it is OK, but they indicate if it is "too much beating". <sep><sep> Then, it would become a form of insurrection. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, we must not march with leaders whose claim to fame is Israel. <sep> In the late 1981, MMM, with its declassified strategy, in which it did not recognize the "state bourgeoisie" as a section of the "bourgeoisie" as a whole, went on to form an alliance with the right wing PT. <sep> It is time to think about utilizing all our good agricultural land for food plantations and converting mills into agro-food industry. <sep> And this is the final advancement towards capitlism. <sep> This would eventually create jobs and ensure a food security base. <sep> The Bak Report that Lalit had prepared gave a presentation at the WSF in Mauritius that was unheard of before. <sep> And in its letter, Hague said, and I quote Hague herself, "We want to continue working with you [addressing us] to open up pathways into new markets and to unlock barriers to investment." <sep> A day when we commemorate the workers' demonstration in Chicago in 1886, who were demanding an 8-hour work day. <sep> It is a Manifesto that specifically mentions a "partnership" between the Government-private sector-NGO to take care of "social" issues, rather than a struggle led by people in oppressed classes and their own conscious actions. <sep> In conclusion, I would say that the biggest difficulty for a young person is catching up with all the past knowledge that the education system has buried. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He had started behaving like a movement on Facebook, like a virtual movement, he had suffered a takeover attempt by A.Subron which did not go well. <sep><sep> Because if my brother has to die (if I'm done dieing, my dignity is done), this nuclear here, is not just for me, not just for me, it's for future generations. <sep><sep> The guy breaks into homes sober, assaults women and then rapes children. <sep><sep> If someone finds me with this pistol in hand, they can agree to kill me, not to use the pistol, but to sell it, to get its monetary value. <sep><sep> In other words, he solemnly declares in public that it is in this new historical block, not in the right, but in the aching. <sep><sep> It was also felt for this colonial dominance and for this communalism of the 40s after Independence. <sep><sep> Even in a coalition they cannot get what they are looking for, their main goal, more nominations, etc. <sep><sep> Tighten your belts this year, food prices will go up. <sep><sep> The session took place at the LPT building, Grand River. <sep><sep> This Convention is known as a kind of counterweight to neoliberal liberalization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> PTr has a large section that is a big plantation. <sep><sep> So, when we talk about communism in politics, to simplify it, it is the political forces and politicians who serve as a social magnet, social and socio-economic difficulties. <sep><sep> Most of the time during meetings were on the principle of more equality in schools, and all the ramifications of this principle. <sep><sep> "That's where we need to go," he said. <sep><sep> He spoke about the importance of reading and writing in life, as well as the value of using the mother tongue, Creole and Bhojpuri, in education. <sep><sep> A representative of the Municipality attended a conference on non-violence, at the Zurne Non-vyolans, where there were 6 Chagossian women dancing Sega. <sep><sep> He arrived yesterday, but without his suitcase, which is still in Paris. <sep><sep> They are missing when workers from Lesotho, Tunisia, and Morocco are rising. <sep><sep> There have been several arrests and threats of pursuit against other activists of LALIT during the entire history of our party. <sep><sep> For the past 2-3 days, if you go near Rivyer Nwar there, you will find pieces of trade union work, trade unions, circles. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, you can tell him, at the work site. <sep><sep> Or maybe it's just a matter of understanding, and yes, each of these beds, it stimulates, or not. <sep><sep> Another thing that also happens when we rely only on artistic productions that emanate from another culture is a misunderstanding - not to say alienation - from the true sense of certain cultural elements contained in these productions. <sep><sep> Through his articles he was leading a communal campaign to counter what he called 'induced emotions' and was speaking in favor of minority communities. <sep><sep> As he sees the workers' movement weakening, as his system is in crisis, as his profits are declining, he is collapsing, he is withdrawing. <sep><sep> Capitalist system, corrupt organization, central political power and masculine understanding have provoked self-aliens. <sep><sep> In the first article in the book, Ram Seegobin situates that moment, and the importance of Diego Garcia therein. <sep><sep> Thierry Chateau is a journalist who works for Le Mauricien. <sep><sep> Report of strength between employer and employee, which exists in this era when a new legal framework is imposed. <sep><sep> On the contrary, we say because of our LALIT, we do it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the last week, French workers received praise for the resilience they showed after their jobs were relocated to Mauritius for 117 Euros per month, compared to the previous 4,000 Euros per month. <sep><sep> Other studies done in Haiti demonstrate the same issue. <sep><sep> Now, Navin Ramgoolam is positioning himself to say how the Labour Party has united Omnicane, Mr. Maurel, planters, landowners, and worker and artisan unions. <sep><sep> He also represents a partial victory in the fight for rights of return. <sep><sep> It is a message that is different from what you have been hearing in previous years. <sep><sep> There are around 120 colonies and 102 outposts in the colonies in the West Bank. <sep><sep> Recently, he visited Mauritius and Seychelles and agreed to speak at LALIT's session on "Education and Marxism" in our new series of "Political Education" sessions. <sep><sep> In an interview with Mauritius Times on 9-15 March, Bizlall announced that he would stop his union activities ("J’arrête mes activités syndicales à la fin du mois"). <sep><sep> With education for everyone, we have made a lot of progress and reflection. <sep><sep> Today, with economic crises and upcoming election campaigns in America, there is pressure to strengthen military bases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the same speech when he was talking about the security industry problem, when he say we need to be competitive globally, in the security industry he say we have 11 mills in the country. <sep><sep> One day for what has been lost, what was so laughable. <sep><sep> Increasing police by 770, creating a new Melrose prison, new Piton detention center, and new station. <sep><sep> - dominant class ideology, it dominates everyone in society, even those who suffer from this domination by the ruling class, the owning class. <sep><sep> and also to understand that showing someone how to read and write is not an act of charity or social convenience but to teach them a right and also a yellow light of emancipation and liberation for each individual and society as a whole. <sep><sep> In AKM, amidst all this, we have noted that there is a report of internal force agreement within the Academy itself. <sep><sep> 4. These sanctions will make it a convertible CNT from a corporation, making it a private shareholder company. <sep><sep> In this paper, we will briefly look at international context today, the kind of response there is today facing the international capitalist crisis, different forms of internationalist response in history and at the same time, we will look at LALIT's internationalist policy in practice. <sep><sep> After more than 32 years of struggle against drug trafficking on the ground, I swear I can confirm that drug trafficking has been linked to certain politicians. <sep><sep> In the drug squad, we participated as a team. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During a supposed economic crisis period, the Commercial Bank made a profit of Rs4 billion. <sep><sep> A collective of people were so lacking in a sense of belonging that they resorted to attacking a CWA station, as there was no other government symbol besides that, on the doorstep. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, two or three more bad taps, which brought an ideological storm, that is academic in the social sciences, the intelligentsia in general, have become capitalist puppets. <sep><sep> Become forward with a national plan to develop solar and wind energy for domestic use and even sell to the CEB. <sep><sep> Either way, they were only throwing themselves at the first Supreme Court, then the Privy Council, then the Committee on Inhuman Rights, United Nations. <sep><sep> The working class in its struggle against exploitation found it increasingly necessary to make its struggle international, not just national. <sep><sep> But what is important, the only way to solve the problems of the world is by the world's people organizing themselves. <sep><sep> We should not be dogmatic and we need to be open-minded. <sep><sep> Finally after Navin Ramgoolam, MSPA settled at 20%, paid in multiple installments, the last installment in 2013. Obviously, it was a 'Great Victory' for the Joint Negotiating Panel. <sep><sep> The Ramgoolam government has only been active on one resolution: it has filed a case at the UNCLOS Tribunal to challenge the British Marine Park. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since 1995, with the formation of the WTO and the implementation of new regulations for international trade, it became clear that the subsidies received by European beet sugar and sugar cane producers in African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries would disappear. <sep><sep> It also resembles a long-lost relationship, as in the Latin languages. <sep><sep> The turmoil in the PTr at the same time as Cabinet Ministers have been shaken by criticism that Minister Bunwaree has publicly made on the PRB Report, a report that the Cabinet Ministers have approved. <sep><sep> MLF was present at the Popular University, the Kirpip 2-3 members of the MLF were present at the Popular University at Bord Kirpip on Saturday, 9 February, on Violence against Women: A New Look (Get The report in Review). <sep><sep> So, when the livelihood of a tiger is threatened, institutions will be expected to promote young people, that is to say to keep their land for agricultural and food production. <sep><sep> The Port Louis Municipal Council was held on Tuesday, there was a forum on Chagos and human rights organized by the Mauritius section of Amnesty International in which the leader of LALIT, Lindsey Collen, spoke. <sep><sep> To worsen the systemic crisis, it is happening at the same time as a major upheaval (for similar reasons) in a second major sector, that is, textiles. <sep><sep> It makes no sense to play blind, to change the game, to not change the game. <sep><sep> What Pravind said to Ashok Jugnauth, but to understand the major economic crises that other "actors" are causing. <sep><sep> Timi was sure that there was a job that he could do without drums, trumpets, and with good results behind. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They left, they say they can't choose their leaders democratically. <sep><sep> Not surprisingly, the more "vulgar" I sound in Creole, the more French-like I become. <sep><sep> The general public is not so interested in internal details when there is a conflict like the recent one in Lalit. <sep><sep> Starting from today, we will have a section in our "News" page on the web by Ragini, a member of Lalit, who is currently in Palestine. <sep><sep> There is also a need to look at ICT issues in the development of terminology and the possibility of developing software/spell checkers in Mother Tongue languages. <sep><sep> (Here because of the constraints of time, comrade Ahmed Khan had to take over the events after 9/11 in 2001). <sep><sep> This is the paradox that a socialist revolutionary political party must always be on its guard against. <sep><sep> Through the LPT competition, we encourage the creation of the Morisyen Creole language. <sep><sep> So, at our University, it is for the youth to gain more tools of analysis, more capacity to analyze, understand situations, and know how to react. <sep><sep> Indeed, remember that we want to use the land where we can grow food, so that we can have garbage to produce electricity to sell to us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he began consulting with Aziza, his face showed a slight surprise and amazement as all good professionals, the gynecologist knew how to control his emotions. <sep> <sep> This question must be addressed so that there is peace in this region. <sep> <sep> The Government has decided not to defend the State in Court, when Sun Trust pursued the Government for Rs 50 million because the Government breached the lease agreement to Sun Trust where the Minister of Education was involved. <sep> <sep> But, what happened with Rama Valayden, his political opportunism led to the liquidation of his own party. <sep> <sep> and create conditions for power to the people, with conscious participation of all individuals in this process. <sep> <sep> Prof. Mike Cole's PhD thesis was on "Racism, History and Educational Policy: From the Origins of the Welfare State to the Rise of the Radical Right". <sep> <sep> A comfortable place was needed so that Princess Prathna's development would not be hindered. <sep> <sep> Maybe it is becoming too twisted for us to understand. <sep> <sep> The collective is to work as a union and a federation, to negotiate for peace and working conditions, as Bizlall announced in his press conference. <sep> <sep> Ganga's health, which her niece spontaneously and naturally appreciated. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Everywhere he looked he saw himself, his reflection in the mirror. <sep><sep> We are discussing an ideology, and then we must be able to explain its content in detail. <sep><sep> His position had become more progressive two weeks before, he was saying that the best loser had been overtaken, then within the framework of an Electoral Reform, he hoped that the Best Loser would disappear. <sep><sep> So the PMSD had this division of the Mauritian population on the one hand the 'authentic' Mauritians and on the other hand the non-Mauritians, the immigrants. <sep><sep> And that everyone knew to maintain the Cotonou Convention had to obtain a 'waiver' (a special exception) from the WTO (OMC) and this exception expired on 31 December 2007. <sep><sep> We distributed 8,000 leaflets on the main roads this morning, always criticizing this bourgeois alliance and explaining its strategy. <sep><sep> And also through activities to promote the Creole language such as exhibitions, workshops, Creole Language Day celebrations, literary competitions. <sep><sep> In this historical meeting, it brought together in a single meeting all Chagossian groups, organizations and individuals who know their rights on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Because the only thing these 3 slogans mean is that we do not need to do anything at all, just pray to God! <sep><sep> But according to history, when we look back, there are already two response elements that we have obtained, which can help us move forward. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After more than 3 years, the State of Emergency was imposed on the Nablus and Salfit districts, and the army has started to set up checkpoints. <sep> <sep> 16 candidates took part in the exam and were able to choose whether to answer in English or Creole. <sep> <sep> whether MMM or MSM, if they were in government, they will seek to restore profits for capitalists by making the working class and poor people bear all the burden. <sep> <sep> And secondly, how revolutionary regimes and revolutionary struggles, for instance, in Chiapas with Subcommander Marcos. <sep> <sep> -Ally Hosenbokus went to a MARON Congress in 2006 on behalf of LALIT. <sep> <sep> In parliament today, there is the possibility that some ministers who have served for 25 years when they are elected will receive a large pension for their retirement after turning 40 and no longer being in parliament. <sep> <sep> So if after 3 years of detention, Mohammed still hasn't been released or we still don't know where he is, it seems that he will be arrested. <sep> <sep> Hope you find it of use, and please leave your comments for us to send to LPT. <sep> <sep> In the Congress, LALIT is also supporting our mobilization campaign for an Economic Political Alternative, which we launched more than 4 years ago. <sep> <sep> In conclusion, the Berenger government stated that the Workers' Opposition and commentators have misunderstood what he said. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People who are so hungry, so ambitious, visionary, active, creative, sensitive, courageous, who during a downturn, still maintain those traits that many revolutionary leaders develop during an upturn. <sep><sep> A red petal on a flamingo tree does not bring bananas. <sep><sep> Apart from hearing news on the radio and television, Timi did not receive much news on politics. <sep><sep> When PMSD was crumbling in the 90s, its base was scattered among different leaders. <sep><sep> And it is realizing that its difficulties are increasing from there. <sep><sep> And then, when we understand that the government has better managed the situation and we make more progress. <sep><sep> Today it has reached 4,812. Among them are 219 adolescents, 31 of whom are under 16. <sep><sep> Even the smallest punishments, I return to decriminalizing abortion, are important. <sep><sep> Here, it is not the working class that governs the country, but these bureaucratic circles are named by the party. <sep><sep> Because this type of feeling, this type of experience, if not passed on to the coming generations, means one is not analyzing the reality of social class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One of the fundamental problems in the current system is the political language. <sep> <sep> In 2007, and I was present there, and in the protests that have been, the US has been in the base of Manta, Ecuador. <sep> <sep> The women's feelings, the women's dances were entering another culture altogether. <sep> <sep> The military started closing checkpoints in Salfit and Nablus. <sep> <sep> To Use imans, as an interim capital, for higher profits, rather than using visas for capital to reorient the economy itself, by investing in the industry for preservation. <sep> <sep> Given the experience of these last 11 years, in LALIT we hope now that Mauritius Telecom workers will be ready to mobilize again. <sep> <sep> And when workers have raised grievances against employers and against the government, then the government has intervened: <sep> <sep> Today it has become necessary to stop using what the Israeli regime is using. <sep> <sep> Today, with the global economic crisis, imperialist countries like France are panicking and, in their efforts to solve the crisis, are putting the burden of the crisis on their people. <sep> <sep> When the previous government changed the employee wage compensation system, for example, introduced the NPC from the start, and finally successfully implemented it, it triggered penalties in the trade union movement. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But every time there is a pilgrimage to the tomb of Jacob, tears and blood flow in the villages, a powder keg. <sep>

<sep> Like we found in the colonial system, the slavery system, the imperialist camps, the plundering of resources in Asia, Africa, Latin America. In different phases, capitalism has expanded its reach, asserting its domination. <sep>

<sep> In reality, the PT has almost completely eliminated the PMSD (when it represented the establishment/big importers, what we call the "historic bourgeoisie") in an alliance together with it in the Government, so that it can successfully stabilize its Historical Bloc. <sep>

<sep> The capitalist crisis is growing with profit on one side exploding and on the other side workers' rights, public services, health systems, education systems are being undermined. <sep>

<sep> Just like the limousines R&L had long ago! <sep>

<sep> In other words, all this would have been a self-critique for its silences, on one side, and for its hysterical and misguided campaigns, on the other side. <sep>

<sep> They're producing dissent in my emerging nations, they're gaining access to the European Market. <sep>

<sep> This program includes an analysis of the reality in which we find ourselves, demands transitional politics with the potential to increase class consciousness and political awareness, and work to popularize this program. <sep>

<sep> In a sober but dynamic mixture, they have captivated the spectators with this "sad story 'too sad even'". <sep>

<sep> They say they study the capitalist system very thoroughly so they can criticize it more effectively. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many friends who were involved in this work are present here. <sep> <sep> This course has supported the detailed bourgeois who wanted his "by" IRS and that, now, has the possibility of making "little" IRS. <sep> <sep> But we have participated in several elections: 1983, 1987, 2000, 2005 and in partial areas, Vacoas-Phoenix. <sep> <sep> G. Duval never regretted his anti-independence stance and in favor of a form of association with Great Britain. <sep> <sep> The course helped LPT members to understand the nature of the Creole language better, and promote the language. <sep> <sep> They held a meeting where they invited Per Martin King and Dharam Raj. <sep> <sep> A journalist took a plane to make a tourist report on a country; this means there was a conflict of interest. <sep> <sep> If they were ill, they were more likely to deport them instead. <sep> <sep> Even though people were catching on, they were keeping to themselves. <sep> <sep> The film that many friends enjoyed watching at the Film Club Last Friday, Lindsey Collen said, showed this "end of the rain" well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then he explained how the food crisis has become a systemic crisis here. <sep><sep> From Be to Cape, from Cape Misery to Cape Beautiful, there are union members, there are workers in the security industry. <sep><sep> It is a place where one must politically commit to understanding, because "economic leconomi" alone has ended up on the political horizon. <sep><sep> This was a very positive move that fits in with the new global context. <sep><sep> The conference was clearly organized by COPAC (Co-operative and Policy Alternative Center) and the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation. <sep><sep> When he graduates, he also gets involved in what is called the "workfare program" where he can follow a new course to get a new job or he can get help to start a small business. <sep><sep> with a boss (no longer just a boss who "gives" him a job, "gives" him a salary, often "gives" him a house), but in a relationship of collective exploitation. <sep><sep> In the evening, I was attending MMM meetings where comrade Newton Rose-Hill collected. <sep><sep> This means that each member represents a force (in terms of their mind, their experience, their neighborhood, their workplace), and when you put that force together, when we all put that together. <sep><sep> 80% of the population of Gaza depends on them to serve them in terms of international humanitarian aid. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>When they choose to make a comparison between a church and a cathedral, it is not clear what this symbolism means. <sep>On the other side of where we are, there is an Israeli observation tower that monitors all movements on the coast and within Palestinian villages. <sep>Whether it's Jin Fei, Patel, both strategic territories. <sep>Why is it different, because the clash of classes also has this economic aspect, where you are fighting against exploitation every day, but at the same time, the long-term vision is political power. <sep>Each driver of the vehicle must get off and open the trunk for inspection by two soldiers. <sep>There are some graduates who are struggling to find work. <sep>We need to reform the village election system and village council. <sep>Maryann? Lorenn? Marlenn? A name something like that.' - 'Loryann?' - 'Yes!' - 'Did he call him Loryann?' - 'Loryann? Loryann? Yes, exactly!' - 'I think I know him. <sep>This is the type of reality that the public is exposed to on Radio everyday. <sep>The public in Mauritius knows that during the period from December 2002 to January 2003, Lalit and People's Forum were organizing several "parallel activities" during Bush's visit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT has raised the issue, with great difficulty, on the question of violence perpetrated by State officials. <sep> <sep> I got into a taxi and started to count coins. <sep> <sep> When he went to call LALIT to inform them of what was happening, a police officer prevented him from using the telephone. <sep> <sep> Lenin, in his book "State and Revolution" published in 1917, mentions the works of Engels. <sep> <sep> While drinking coffee in a coffee shop, taking a break and talking about the family, about the things that were resumed on Wednesday and about the upcoming session. <sep> <sep> Life is unfolding on different cards, meaning hidden treasures do not exist. <sep> <sep> Just look, the mirror is not clear because tears prevent new residents from settling in the new homes even on Palestinian land. <sep> <sep> But, this is the greatest achievement of this period, these last 30 years. <sep> <sep> There was also participation from Brazil, Lenin, Saudi, German, Belgium, Jordan, Ireland. <sep> <sep> Another way is that the law has affected industrial relations by eliminating TCSB, the Termination of Contract of Service Board. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As I mentioned earlier, starting in 1979, when SILU and UASI began mobilizing heavily on the issue of recognition, in that year 1979, comrades here, to recall that time, Kuppan, Ton Kade, other comrades, and I went out in my area, in a period of 7 months, I attended 82 meetings. <sep><sep> for example, starting this year, Ashok Subron was in the Political Bureau. <sep><sep> Each member ensures that it is a faithful reflection of what happened in the last meeting, proposes amendments, votes, before approving the minutes; <sep><sep> It is a matter concerning the existence and future of Palestine. <sep><sep> Celebrating 60 years for his sixtieth birthday, Timi decided to prepare a nice dinner for his family and also asked all his children to be present. <sep><sep> Because language is a necessary tool to understand the world around us, as it is only through the use of the mother tongue that we can ensure a good education that allows for the development of children. <sep><sep> The capitalist system, which was an unequal system that could succeed, this system has collapsed today. <sep><sep> ICAC has sent the files of Siddick Chady and Gilbert Philippe to the DPP. <sep><sep> It has also risen IRS and Mall on land that belonged to them. <sep><sep> We know that there are many young people who were participating in the election campaign, and their intentions are surely good, they may want to fight against communalism in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have decided not to participate in various activities. <sep><sep> But, the true victory against historical crime on the Diego and Chagos issue, we have not yet achieved it. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin intervened as the leader of LALIT and as a doctor. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the security bourgeoisie has invested in the sugar industry in Tanzania, Ivory Coast, Kenya. <sep><sep> Even this document, like the request that the union submit to the Government under the Employment Relations Act, is based on a document that LALIT member Ram Seegobin had drafted for the trade union, in the LALIT against IRA context. <sep><sep> Clearly this scandal will cause problems within the Alliance. <sep><sep> *Demands that the Government come forward with a draft bill that: <sep><sep> it is not easy to understand it in a single cut. <sep><sep> Yesterday, the American Civil Lawyers, one of its bees, a Lincoln bee, is going to stop the enslavement in the South. <sep><sep> and in the context of a serious social crisis which will worsen with the economic crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Through Pro-Vice Chancellor Professor Ameenah Gurib-Fakim to continue this course and make it a Certificate in Creole Studies. <sep> <sep> Furthermore, there is a lot of water being wasted unnecessarily, for a long time. <sep> <sep> We titled it "Changes in the union movement", rather than just "Changes in the union movement", because we wanted to include unions - the way they heat up, chili or freeze, their legal framework, and legality. <sep> <sep> The government is bringing new labor and industrial laws to provide employers with more facilities to license workers. <sep> <sep> Even though we know that grassroots organizations are often funded by the bourgeoisie themselves, such as MMKA being funded by Thierry Lagesse (read our article on NEWS). <sep> <sep> This type of corruption has finally led to the death of PT Surath in 1965 and the assassination of Azor Adelaide in 1971 in Curepipe. <sep> <sep> These two categories need more attention, especially when they get a drink while driving, underestimate anyone, especially if their children are in the car. <sep> <sep> This rock in the pond of her life was troubling her vision, destroying her confidence. <sep> <sep> After that, there will be a debate session on the situation in Palestine. <sep> <sep> In Reunion, Jean-Yves Dick contacts LALIT regularly via Skype. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, Bérenger, L'Estrac, Gobine, and Ahnee have convened a meeting, a dialogue between LALIT and MSM, where in exchange for money, LALIT will concede its "listening" to MSM. <sep><sep> The history behind this system is that PMSD and CAM brought the campaign for proportional representation. <sep><sep> Have we ever reached a situation where power had shifted from the Prime Minister's Office to fall into the hands of the police commissioner and top officials? <sep><sep> We need to establish as strong a link as possible to ensure we can coordinate actions effectively. <sep><sep> It has been said that the first generation of MSM youth brought about an "economic boom," and now it is the responsibility of the second generation of MSM to continue that work. <sep><sep> After the Conference, we will assume authority together and decide how we will utilize it. <sep><sep> But, let's look back at another period in history. <sep><sep> Craftsmen have always gained experience, workers of LALIT passing it down through generations, cherishing the experience of informal organization on-site, and more formal union organization. <sep><sep> Where the government was beginning to talk about grandiose projects. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, LALIT enjoys publishing letters that the Education for Workers initiative has sent to all deputies: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They really do not bring, nor pretend to bring, nor even seem to bring any new orientation to the economy. <sep><sep> The reception in Plaine Verte was well received, and many people are asking whether our candidate, Ally Hosenbokus, will also run in Plaine Verte for the general election. <sep><sep> And we begin with a particularity for Mauritius, even though it emerged in the context of neo-liberal party politics, in this ICT era, it has raised the issue: <sep><sep> At the same time, we have worked to highlight the fact that the government is sticking to its strategy on the Chagos secretariat and that what it has put in place for the Marine Park is not enough to mobilize the necessary international support. <sep><sep> In this context, there were around a hundred kilometers of squid covering Mauritius. <sep><sep> Journalists should not necessarily take money, but they have an interest in reducing the importance of an event. <sep><sep> Our Seminar will begin on May 1st, with this contextualization. The introduction will deal with the various links between the classes - how LALIT found it and how it was always found. <sep><sep> When Kaya died in prison, he had 32 wounds on his body. <sep><sep> * Strengthen the powers of the Village Council and Ward Council and give them a badge that allows them to make developments. <sep><sep> Without realizing it, they had struck a blow in the bush not far from the house where Princess Prathna and her three Sadou children were staying. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Due to the preparation and mobilization initiated by LALIT, an international solidarity network was established. <sep><sep> Therefore, it appears that, although the boss offers good benefits, workers prefer to take a 2-day break in a row so their bodies can recover. <sep><sep> But, in Lagres, the military force has descended into the streets. <sep><sep> When it was approaching the thirtieth day, exhaustion was almost complete. <sep><sep> Their Plan A was to nominate 62 candidates, but when they refused to put their community on their Nomination Paper, officials had to reluctantly refuse to accept their Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> The government announced that it is not "targeting" poor people, it is only targeting the 3% poorest people to stop giving them old-age pensions. <sep><sep> In a small early-morning group, they mentioned how they used the Rev to start a discussion with anyone. <sep><sep> We had a MMM leadership that, also, had its own class reality, its own interests that had clashed with the IMF-WB offensive. <sep><sep> The intellectual petty bourgeois are mostly involved in the development of tourism, the services sector, and ICT. <sep><sep> After the death of H. Duval, Maurice Allet will take over the leadership of PMSD. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the last 6 months, a series of amendments proposed by Minister of Labor, Shakeel Mohamed, have been passed after a final vote. <sep> <sep> * Several new malls have been constructed: Bagatelle, Cascavelle, and another upcoming project like Neotown. <sep> <sep> Cindy Clelie began a press conference explaining the context in which LALIT is organizing a CONGRESS that is in the midst of a crisis, either on a local or international level. <sep> <sep> Therefore, it is not surprising that workers (meaning all individuals who work to make a living, more than three-quarters of the population of Mauritius) feel very anxious when the Government claims to be "saving people's lives" for the better. <sep> <sep> She goes on to say that her Government has "revived the economy", and if there is a dramatic situation, it is the result of "threats and challenges from foreign countries". <sep> <sep> Especially through "groups" where contact details are shared among individuals through a notification system that organizers of Facebook Groups have access to. <sep> <sep> This discrimination is very serious, considering that school is now compulsory up until the age of 16. <sep> <sep> The Government continues to offer facilities, make concessions, and implement relief plans, even if they change their name, engaging in the same actions that Sithanen took. <sep> <sep> Therefore, it is a matter of social class, it is individual, it is conscious. <sep> <sep> Berenger was saying that there is a "community" that is traumatized, and if we continue to lose, this will lead to an emotional reaction. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, he says, no one in the village can help him because only a Palestinian can get a permit to drive in his car because he is the owner. <sep><sep> We need demands, we need to mobilize workers in a way that goes beyond mere demands. <sep><sep> Sir Ralph had professional and personal reasons to encourage him on this path. <sep><sep> Ramou, even though he had a strong personality, wanted to influence, he was a hard worker. <sep><sep> The moment has not yet arrived for us in the party to decide what we will do in the general election - it is still a tactical question for LALIT - because alliances and launches are still unclear. <sep><sep> There are many studies on food and peace plantations that are sleeping in the drawers of several Ministers, the Minister of Finance must give orders to all relevant Ministers to pull out all these studies and implement them. <sep><sep> Fortunately, they are organizing to rebuild the school in Deir Balut that the army demolished for the second time. <sep><sep> Studies show that we have not even lost sugar production. <sep><sep> They say we need more police to address the underlying problems of precarious work and serious injuries. <sep><sep> Social media (from owners, CEOs to journalists), is the same social base that the MMM has. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, in an ironic way, everything that supports associative life contains a weakness because it also contains grouping on the basis of sectors and divisions. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, there is a particular form of state that contains many elements of the state bonapartist within it. <sep><sep> One in Phoenix, one in Tamarin, one in Curepipe. <sep><sep> The God they worship has a capability that humans do not. <sep><sep> And when the NPC holds its second round, the 3 federations, including NTUC, form the CSG. <sep><sep> The meeting was like a "snapshot" of the current reality of the workplace today, when viewed from the perspective of how the reality of the workplace has changed over different times and has arrived at the current work situation. <sep><sep> Ramgoolam in Media Watch made many important points on that. <sep><sep> He influenced many sectors - tourism, sugar cane, BPO. <sep><sep> And when the group goes as far as playing on religious symbols like the Church bell for its beginning and end, it is deciding something on light. <sep><sep> He said that this trend, it is very worrying and seems to worsen with the increase in food prices that is coming. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bureaucratic office is fragmented and dominated by macho attitudes, creating indescribable disorder. <sep> <sep> On the international level, especially in Europe, capitalist class interventions are shifting the crisis burden onto the shoulders of the workers. <sep> <sep> Today, what we are beginning to do is reactivate those slogans. <sep> <sep> In the sugar industry, for example, there was a special demand for the rights of artisans, for workers. <sep> <sep> It has been said that all this happened just before the visit of Madeleine Albright, Secretary of that "friendly country" calling on America. <sep> <sep> In the last ten years, his health was not very good, but he continued to participate in LALIT activities, up to the Labor Day celebration in 2012, and was a regular reader of LALIT Review. <sep> <sep> So LALIT will look at these existing and potential links. <sep> <sep> In general, the police and lawyers need to maintain a professional relationship every day. <sep> <sep> On Wednesday, January 22, from 6 to 10 p.m., there was a session on "political education" about Palestine where a dozen members and sympathizers of LALIT were present in Grand River. <sep> <sep> Creole and Bhojpuri languages (in Hindi class) have entered schools in Standard 1. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then workers go to sit in mass, all together, they put all their money together, they share it equally. <sep><sep> We also had in our internationalist work, 2 LALIT militants, Comrade Kisna Kistnasamy and comrade Yannick Jeanne who went to Cuba and Venezuela to witness what is happening in the country where there is and there is a revolution. <sep><sep> MSM already has its people in the State, since it was in power under Anerood Jugnauth. <sep><sep> There is pressure on them to respond to union members, so they, being negotiators, can sign all kinds of agreements, even those in favor of bosses. <sep><sep> We militants in LALIT do this in detail in order to change society. <sep><sep> The struggle continues, and the enemy-enemies become increasingly fierce attacking empty Vichy stores on RIOT Avenue to prevent them from killing families. <sep><sep> There is that woman 1,000 arpents of land that Labor has possessed since establishment. <sep><sep> She said yesterday, the press will notice that there was a long interview with Bishop Maurice Piat and also, yesterday, Minister Gokhool was on the MBC program. <sep><sep> But it seems that there is confusion about the question if Hurnam already had a "previous" condemnation. <sep><sep> So, the LALIT form of class struggle depends on the form of exploitation that exists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> School is introducing a new element that has been included in education in 2012: the teaching of Creole and Bhojpuri languages as subjects in primary schools. <sep><sep> * Advocating for welfare state rights, such as universal old-age pensions, widow's pensions, and disability pensions. <sep><sep> Even in certain villages, the opposition team has come out strong, Riviere du Rempart, Mahebourg. <sep><sep> So, it's not just in the case of Bernard Maigrot, which JUSTICE last week conducted a thorough analysis, but it's a practical remedy. <sep><sep> So they have retreated a bit, especially during the press conference they held on the last Friday, about the way the party has dealt with the problem in the Youth Group. <sep><sep> In response, we do not need to do more than say that Jeff Lingaya has named himself as a multifaceted hunger striker, and he has even gone as far as growing a beard during his hunger strike. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we say, we must, when we are challenging the pro-capitalist political movement of the Labor Government, ensure that we strengthen another pro-capitalist political force. <sep><sep> This is not necessarily a "revolutionary" or "extreme" proposal. <sep><sep> The IWPS (where I am a volunteer) has provided him with contacts such as the Housing Movement in Ramallah and a lawyer association in Israel so that he can get in touch. <sep><sep> However, when you try to create new alliances and you call it blue-white-red, it might be a political error. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, the majority of the government was unable to put more family, as this would lead to the risk of losing a seat. <sep><sep> * Union financing by the state, and the nomination of worker representatives on certain institution boards. <sep><sep> Therefore, there is a significant influence of opposing ideologies. <sep><sep> As the working class becomes increasingly divided on a wide-ranging platform, especially on issues that it dislikes, some things that it dislikes. <sep><sep> The only voice at the Mauritian state level that was not in line with all these moves to legitimize the base of Diego was Cassam Uteem, President of the Republic at that time. <sep><sep> When they consider why they have lost their homes - the place where they are living, where their families are, their listeners - millions of people have lost their homes. <sep><sep> We can say in the sugar cane field where all workers are equal compared to the employers, workers in the fields have relatively more freedom. <sep><sep> However, during the debate in the morning session, we began to realize that it is already among us that we have very different ideas about the future of class struggle. <sep><sep> 2 - The Mauritian government needs to collaborate with countries from the La Francophonie to make requests for a Moratorium and a Social Lodge to become central after Cancun. <sep><sep> They will be able to develop scientific, philosophical, and technical knowledge that corresponds to their capacities and that is necessary for their individual, social, and growth in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If he goes to the auction, he would give space to people in his stomach; if he had to buy a machine that is not available in the villages, he would offer to buy it and then wait for it to be delivered. 
<sep><sep> So, all of you, all of you, there is a deliberate strategy to treat us as people who analyze, but do not act. 
<sep><sep> And despite the occupation force doing everything possible to make people's lives in this region unbearable. 
<sep><sep> There was an FSSC leader who spent some time presenting his report in a session of his federation when he was president. 
<sep><sep> (And of course, we used a lot of NUS, which was called SSS at the time, so we presented them in the Assembly before starting.) When a delegate begins to speak, we are starting to feel that his conscience is based on the nature of his report itself. 
<sep><sep> If he told us 3 years ago that in Spain there would be millions of people walking from Madrid to Brussels, if 2 years ago. 
<sep><sep> Working class, not Happy World workers, not security industry workers, no. 
<sep><sep> We hear people on the radio every day, saying "We hope to have a Minister in our constituency, then we can be fine". 
<sep><sep> CT Power, a Malaysian group, is supposed to work together with CEB to establish a power generation unit based on coal, at Pointe aux Caves. 
<sep><sep> The worker, as a class, exists based on exploitation. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a beginning of a profound debate, but it has not yet been fully completed. <sep><sep> It is a democratization that primarily benefits a section of the bourgeoisie (and petite-bourgeoisie economically) relative to oligarchy. <sep><sep> On the way to Marta, after the Huwara checkpoint where we need to show our passports and identity cards, we crossed 4 checkpoints with Israeli soldiers with big physique, jeeps, and trucks. <sep><sep> But today there is Xavier Luc Duval who is only a Minister. <sep><sep> Sometimes ongoing, in a mobilization campaign "against" economic crisis, and at the same time criticize all of that together with an alternative economy program. <sep><sep> either semi-synthetic or synthetic substances that are administered into the body through various means (either orally, through inhalation, intravenous, nasal) that alter the body's functioning, numb sensations and erases the individual's consciousness. <sep><sep> PMSD also has old ties in historical bourgeoisie, with France, with Iranian Catholic Church and a section of the press. <sep><sep> There is also an invisible pressure for the bank and especially the Central Bank to value rupee. <sep><sep> At that time, Sinndi had to stop working because his illness had advanced. <sep><sep> But it is a bourgeoisie that depends on state power, this is why we call it a state bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are some communes in the Social Welfare Department that support the Labor Party and MMM. <sep><sep> Furthermore, the working class, if it could control production, could define development on an ecological basis, and ecology would support it. <sep><sep> And there was a time when the economic crisis was very strong. <sep><sep> It is true that the situation has calmed down on the border since the Lesotho Government announced that it is placing a peacekeeping mission on its border with Gaza. <sep><sep> In Telfair, for example, Lizinn Hong Kong Shanghai has laid off 150 workers, for example. <sep><sep> And when I talk about unionism, I am rather referring to the work of a union militancy that is more interested in this third level of union role: <sep><sep> These are two of the biggest challenges we face. <sep><sep> It hurt his pride and showed his commitment. <sep><sep> The textile industry has permanently taken out almost all of its permanent jobs, from 50,000 to 3,500. <sep><sep> But we also did not think that the major thinkers, the "opinion makers" in China, such as Prof. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People were predicting that violence would break out today, as Ram was connected to another case related to the Lalit member, Lindsey Collen is inside. <sep><sep> Pakistan's foreign policy hasn't changed - it was an expansionist policy so the Islamist militia was its ally. <sep><sep> Wherever he went, he is present today. <sep><sep> The music in the movie is also stuck in the mind after watching the movie. <sep><sep> We need to "regroup" money from people laughing somewhere else. <sep><sep> Especially since the movement against various bases in Okinawa, and a major health hub that is also a Socialist Party deputy. <sep><sep> He is doing a dissertation in nursing sociology, and particularly to examine the precise racial division in the nursing staff in their relationship with their patients. <sep><sep> So Air Mauritius is having trouble getting a monumental gain. <sep><sep> Together with closing Rodrig, we need to build dykes, and flatten the ground on the slope to prevent erosion. <sep><sep> at the Brown Street Community Hall, Newtown, Sydney on "Capitalist Crisis - Socialist Renewal". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There were about 25 people present at the meeting, including representatives from the human rights organization (Dis Moi), Mouvement Liberasyon Fam, SOS Femmes, a Women's Collective, and members of the trade union organization. <sep><sep> Berenger has also been criticized for having too much power since the DPP, which is supposed to be independent. <sep><sep> At this time, there is less mobilization around a specific political program because there is more focus and consideration on day-to-day affairs. <sep><sep> He gave his name and also asked for their identity cards. <sep><sep> This constant work gives us the strength to do it. <sep><sep> Conflicts between different capitalist sectors (capital in establishment, in banks, in hotels, in commerce, in industry, in insurance, in the maritime sector, in BPO, etc). <sep><sep> This year Palestine has been central to international politics. <sep><sep> In addition to our simultaneous economic policies that are incompatible with Sustainable Mauritius, there are contradictions in the concept of "sustainable development" itself. <sep><sep> And, since it has been 40 years since Independence, this year we should begin to focus on the struggle for women's emancipation in these 40 years in our country Mauritius. <sep><sep> To ensure the necessary support for transporting the struggle against the American and British States, we need to unite our demands with those of the historical movements against war and colonialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For the Good governance and Wrongs of extension, this represents yet another attempt at delaying tactics, as Minister Soodhun and various governments since 1982 have done. <sep><sep> It is a significant obstacle for him to reign, and it is restrictive enough to not contain too many internal contradictions that are too obvious. <sep><sep> However, after the election, Bizlall found terrible results. <sep><sep> They think it will be a way to make people in Israel and around the world understand what occupation and mirror they want to say in everyday life for children and planters. <sep><sep> Together with other organizations, we have taken action to leave an “Obama” footprint to expose the roles of the US and Israel in sabotaging the recognition of the Palestinian State. <sep><sep> For example, after the movement in the CNT, there was a proposal at the CNT level. <sep><sep> When decisions were made to nationalize, many posts in the refinery were decided to be left vacant, but the workers decided to stay, continuing to work. <sep><sep> This is what we are aiming for when we talk about mobilization. <sep><sep> And partly, it is somewhat of a disaster, as it is not easy to do without any sanctions. <sep><sep> If everyone went to school, everyone did well in school, everyone got their 5A's, everyone finished HSC, everyone got a degree, then the social class EE, D +, all would disappear, all would become A. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, in his Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance Xavier Duval did not really address the seriousness of the crisis. <sep>
<sep> There were about 60 delegates present from different RSP branches: Perth, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, and there were also RSP members working in other countries who specifically came to participate in the Congress. <sep>
<sep> Cindy Clelie: Given the factors in the background that Ram has outlined and in view of the general election coming in 2005, Lalit is launching its campaign for an alternative economy. <sep>
<sep> The MAAS did not come into public discussion, but it was presented as a fait accompli last year. <sep>
<sep> The Lalit program has been developed collectively with the support of branches and Lalit activists. Alain Ah-Vee said that this program relies on constant mobilization towards a direction, without the force imbalance in favor of the working class.
<sep> This is extremely important because we are finding that what is produced by the working class is not by an individual worker, but by the working class as a whole, not just in one country.
<sep>
<sep> There have been comments from Roody Muneean, who said that while he was in the Youth Group of Lalit, he was not actually a full member.
<sep>
<sep> They are using demagoguery to hide, to camouflage the economic crisis that is looming over us, pretending that our country is resilient.
<sep>
<sep> Rajni Lallah has also criticized the Mauritian government for allowing the State to make profits, through the sale of arable land, the sale of IRS properties, and the risky construction of a Mall that is failing.

<sep> This is them trying to make people forget the real responsible for poverty (extreme or not), which is the capitalist system exploiting workers to maximize its profits and imposing its economic dictatorship on fertile land. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The 3-4 returning personalities of our history, Claude Noel, Klan Gujadhur, Klan Leclesio, Dede Maingard, Claude Lagesse. <sep><sep> All five, 280 kilometers north, found plantations of all kinds of fruit and vegetables. <sep><sep> They found that it is the State which created and signed the convention against torture, showing that it is not outlawed to torture, but instead the law provides damages for citizens in police custody that abuse them. <sep><sep> It seems that an inappropriate petition, makes one ask if there should be a petition to Obama regarding control by the UK. <sep><sep> It will be a very interesting electoral campaign for LALIT. <sep><sep> We have reservations on the trade unionist strategy, which risks political recuperation by the Workers' Party. <sep><sep> Not only that, but he is shaken because his class analysis tells him that he needs to form an alliance with Workers and his electoralist strategy tells him that he needs to combat the Workers. <sep><sep> Times have changed: While the former colonizers traded necklaces and alcohol with the people in Africa to enter and take control of Africa, today they are selling virtual products. <sep><sep> Because of this long history of theft, destruction, and repression of the Creole and Bhojpuri languages, we have developed a relationship with our mother tongue that reflects and even internalizes this oppression. <sep><sep> Therefore, when people shout behind MMM or mobilize in a platform that has started to contest the subsidy levels on SC-HSC exams, it appears as if the platform is making it clear that they always opposed competition.<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He has used newly declassified documents to explain how this conspiracy has been in preparation since 196597. <sep><sep> In a relatively demobilized period, the government and employers prefer to have a "permanent" (as it is said in French), meaning not a direction that replaces each session of the National Assembly. <sep><sep> We support, we in Lalit, for Chagossians, it is not at all conditional on the political agenda set by their leaders at any time in history. <sep><sep> This is one of the aspects of this conflicting relationship. <sep><sep> In a trial that happened on September 30, 2002 at the District Court (Columbia) in the US, Judge Ricardo Urbina dismissed the case against De Chazal Du Mee for technical reasons. <sep><sep> During this time, for these ladies, it was more important to have a garden than to have a voting booth. <sep><sep> In late 2024, an important study, according to the newspaper, focused heavily on politics in the period 1970-1995. <sep><sep> However, the Ministry of the Environment has descended upon Terra, Alteo, and Omnicane. <sep><sep> Following many efforts by JUSTICE, Lalit, MLF and others, after the brutality suffered by Nitin Chinien, three MCIT officers, Szn, <sep><sep> Now, the Minister of Labor is addressing an issue in front of the NRB, to revive the NRB. So, this is in front of the Supreme Court. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Navin Ramgoolam has decided to return to politics and has held a press conference on October 27th to make it clear that it is the government that is responsible for the economic and environmental crisis, not the sugar industry. <sep><sep> It is a plan to make the country dependent on fossil energy and coal for another 10 years. <sep><sep> Today, LALIT is focused on this issue and is working on a program to organize and mobilize to strengthen the working class to overthrow the system responsible for exploitation. <sep><sep> Since the 1987 elections, there has not been a coalition between the Progressive Party and the Militant Socialist Movement. <sep><sep> Wherever there are union conflicts, federation conflicts, or confederation conflicts, he walks away from them, so that he can maintain unconditional neutrality, after the conflict. <sep><sep> This is how in LALIT, members Kisna Kistnasamy and Yannick Jeanne have expressed interest in joining this Revolutionary Brigade. <sep><sep> They are in the "About LALIT" section on our website. <sep><sep> But there are also new sectors where many people are being exploited because the concept of mobility has been generalized. <sep><sep> Climate change is causing a nutritional catastrophe, but when the heart is poisoned, blood's circulation diminishes, food production decreases. <sep><sep> Through its system of permit, barriers, roadblocks, and checkpoints, the World Bank is transforming into a fragmented launching pad for several economic and social enclaves, isolating each other from the rest." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In terms of Work, there are testimonies of families who have taken VRS and those who were present, including a testimony of a family who works at Ere Lingerie. <sep><sep> It is said that the population is expanding faster than food production, so the population is suffering. <sep><sep> The first individual, they all need to leave, whether mother, brother, or sister. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, MMM's alliance was based on "three against one" ("3 against 1", as it was called). <sep><sep> News has it that the United States government has requested permission from the British government to use the military base in Diego Garcia for B-3 aircraft. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam has taken the Diego case from Arvind Boolell and placed it in a unit in his own office. <sep><sep> Slavoy Zizek is another important theorist who has raised questions about ideology and has provided some unusual examples. <sep><sep> It is difficult to reconcile the different interests through normal means. <sep><sep> After that, he met with representatives from the UK and US, but he did not specify what was discussed in detail. <sep><sep> Briefly, we would have liked to have a commentary on the outcome of this debate over a period of time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - Alain Ah-Vee has explained that promoting literature is part of the bi LPT education program just as promoting literacy is for bi LPT.
- However, an external and independent critique is even more important because the Maurice Ile Durable policy runs parallel to government programs that are incompatible with MID.
- There have been anarchist lawyers, and there are anarchist birds.
- An article was published in the press about corruption in Diego Garcia.
- To continue pleasing their patrons, Xavier Duval has acquired a value of Rs100 million in dollars with commercial banks, in order to increase the value of dollars compared to rupees.
- Our movement is growing, becoming more efficient, louder, more powerful, like a thunderstorm.
- Previously there was the IRA and the POA, now it has become PGA, EReA, and ERiA, from one political party to another.
- If you vote for uncle [Ashock Jugnauth] you are voting for the old politics, if you vote for the new politics you are voting for the nephew [Pravind Jugnauth], and if you vote for the new you are voting for the old politics which is about electoral corruption, which is about economic crisis.
- And when we talk about production to sell, we are talking business, and this concept is important, we are talking about money.
- His "leaking boat" was during a time when he was only a Member of Parliament. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And when we talk about a protest program, we are not just talking about a simple list of demands one after the other, we are talking about a real program, where different demands are prioritized over others. 
<sep> - ' Do you know 'A tavern in the town', an Irish folksong I believe?' - 'Yes, you've already heard it once before. 
<sep> So what we expect from a political party regarding its program, is that it has a program that attacks patriarchy, attacks the patriarchal system, that pyramid system. 
<sep> Ram Seegobin was on Radio Top FM on Wednesday, April 19th to discuss the question of linondasyon. 
<sep> He will say "I have a family, I have children, what you are saying there has a lot to do with it!" He won't agree. 
<sep> Gaza today is a prison overflowing with a population of 1.5 million people. 
<sep> Today's students are fortunate enough to receive scholarships, even in schools that we consider today as 'Star Schools', and this is not only at the primary level, but also at the secondary level. 
<sep> But when the Workers' Party was around, everything was calm. 
<sep> He was a clever man, ready to face up to the responsibility. 
<sep> In a burning car, on a pink mirror separating laughter, opening their eyes, looking closely. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a democratization that aims to share this sector of electricity production with other operators that are not IPP, even if they are a Malaysian bourgeoisie, so they do not mix with the bourgeoisie in the Security Industry. <sep> <sep> Instead, it was decided to make a speech as the Minister of Energy and announce decisions regarding the wind power project in Bigara, La Nicoliere Hydro Plant, and subsidies for economic light bulbs. <sep> <sep> When everyone is in the same position, then there will be fewer class conflicts, fewer conflicting interests. <sep> <sep> This means that it is a goal document that states that interest will be repaid every month for 15 years. <sep> <sep> We think we should move towards real economic diversification, especially in stable, rapid employment creation. <sep> <sep> They will introduce a new variety of sugarcane called "Energy Cane" because it produces a lot of bagasse. <sep> <sep> It is worth noting that it is very informal, quite rustic, in Creole. <sep> <sep> But this alienation - its lassitude, its satiety - emerges from a process that exists in the worker's relationship with capital, in its relationship with machines, and in its relationship with money. <sep> <sep> But it is a reprisal in the same system that has created the crisis. <sep> <sep> Everything to trick everyone and sell all kinds of initial products to them, from birth to retirement until the loss of money, people are isolated from other countries because of many things about them on their accounts of telecommunication. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The kind of capability to put in place is for a "recommendation" or "declaration", a kind of capability that has many political powers. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is organized, so that it is relatively stable over time, a "block" that will be determined in time. <sep><sep> Political science, only looks at the way in which it governs, the means it uses to govern, the way it comes to power, remains in power, loses power. <sep><sep> Especially when at the same time, some of them say that they have been in Lalit for 20 years, 22 years, that they still agree with the Lalit program, and then they resign for this kind of reason. <sep><sep> From far away, hiding in a small forest, Princess Prathna, Yosi and their eleven companions were examining the situation. <sep><sep> Even if its basis is somewhat different from PT – rather than large-scale and small-scale, its base is more detailed, trucking, job contracts, business owner's title. <sep><sep> (1) CEB subsidizes renewable energy production and finances projects that go in that direction. <sep><sep> Bernard and I are going to look at you tonight. <sep><sep> PMSD has secretly maintained privileged ties with France through corrupt politicians like Michel Debré and even extreme right-wingers like Jean-Marie Le Pen. <sep><sep> due to climate change, rising fuel prices, and increased use of land for planting to produce bio-fuel instead of food. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mama Kamini told her daughter that her sister and brother-in-law had arrived at the same time because two sisters got married to two brothers. <sep> <sep> His policy of "economic democratization" can help us understand what happened when Finance Minister, Rama Sithanen, left. <sep> <sep> Stop penetration in the society of Mauritius, the US Embassy in Port Louis has increased its funding for civil society organizations. <sep> <sep> Then they protect their restaurants, their company that goes around the island, their catamaran business, their construction company for threats, etc. <sep> <sep> It is the opportunity that the crisis presents for a reorientation of the economy, a reorientation that was needed in every way. <sep> <sep> The PT also has strategies to expand the state bourgeoisie and develop new bases for this new historic information block. <sep> <sep> * PROVOKING DEVALUATIONS: When we put up that slogan on a poster, some people said "But workers won't understand this!". <sep> <sep> And every year, the US Department of Defense closes many bases. <sep> <sep> Because his situation would have been very difficult in the village where he lived, if we hadn't known about it. <sep> <sep> France avoided being hit by a small-scale disaster when there was a man, a predator of women, DSK, who was finally accused by a woman who had filed a complaint against him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is an analysis that is important for us to understand the situation in the country today when we are going through changes in society. <sep><sep> So, after Labor Day, we would be happy to encourage a deeper reflection in the workers' class on this subject. <sep><sep> Rama Sithanen launched the Additional Stimulus Package (ASP) in 2009 to help companies during the crisis. <sep><sep> Here we are reproducing a contradiction of a Blue Horizon Policy that Ram Seegobin made in a Central Committee meeting this weekend. <sep><sep> all people in Mauritius and Rodrigues who have followed our teachers training courses, our courses in learning to read and write Kreol and other courses on language <sep><sep> Because the proportion of a worker's expenses on their employer is not as high a percentage as their expenses. <sep><sep> There is a global economic crisis, rich countries, poor countries, everywhere. <sep><sep> To enter the court, everyone must not pass through security and not pass through metal detectors. <sep><sep> Whether it is MMM or MSM or the Labour Party, they are all proud that they have provided this service to the Establishment, and secure the oligarchy. <sep><sep> It will also be interesting to understand the meaning of this division? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, if there is a branch of MMM that has never voted for Aneerood Jugnauth for the MMM Central Committee, it is because Ramesh Khaytoo did not forgive him for his past in the Hindu Congress and insisted that the MMM Bambous branch not vote for him. <sep><sep> One session was exceptional where two films by Soderberg were shown, one on the Cuban experience and the second on the Bolivian experience based on Che's memoirs. <sep><sep> During and after the political crisis, he dominated the media content with his "vals lalyans" political agenda, remixes, ripley, timama, PT costs, and elwayne timama. <sep><sep> For almost all our information and analysis, it is about "commercial products", as they call themselves. <sep><sep> It represents the difficulties that the sugar planters' association is facing in maintaining its alliance with the sugar. <sep><sep> We need to say that national debate on how to make the national assembly a place where there is vibrant democracy and more control over the executive. <sep><sep> Since there has been a lack of respect, we have cut all ties with the British Government on this issue. <sep><sep> So, when there is this advance, we need to know who brought this issue to light. <sep><sep> We need to dismantle the British Indian Ocean Territories, this fictional territory, and have a reunification of the Republic of Mauritius, according to international law and in conformity with the UN Charter. <sep><sep> We also introduced many speeches on the fight for women's liberation, women's emancipation, and equality during our first Review since 1976. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The same thing as what was delivered to you free of charge with your newspaper, during the election. <sep><sep> You also depend on 3 other things, like Antonio Gramsci predicted, on a deep cynicism. <sep><sep> The question of "economy" in the future as it has never been before. <sep><sep> He is a Marxist also Professor in the "Education and Equality" department at University College Bishop Grosseteste in the city of Lincoln in the UK. <sep><sep> The ILO has raised several issues that we have raised in our document, again. <sep><sep> The American military base on Diego Garcia is a constant threat to the people of Mauritius, and to all people in the region. <sep><sep> So, what it proposes is quite interesting, albeit minimalist. <sep><sep> Each one will see which part is more in favor of democracy than others (for example, the complete abolition of village elections), which part has a program and work history against police violence, complete universality of social benefits; instead of taking on the democratic role, the Mauritian press has become truly satisfied to tell its readers: Here is what you need to do: choose an executive who will reign over you. <sep><sep> UNESCO will present this award to LPT on 8th September 2004 on the occasion of International Literacy Day. <sep><sep> And reactionary forces are using this communal and racist pretext to divert attention. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and where there is the existence of a "final reason" why everything that happens happens (following everything from an "original cause"), often, many times, "God has created it" or "God has wanted it." <sep><sep> Against privatization, against repression, for more equality, and we have demands that go beyond political and economic aspects, contesting the capitalist system itself. <sep><sep> More and more people are interested in Creole languages, they will come closer to us, and we have already taken that step. <sep><sep> Not just against the old regime and the old ruling class, but against the people in general. <sep><sep> Workers' Party - where, if you look closely, it was in power even before Independence, and until today (and only outside the Cabinet between 1982 and 1983 for 9 months, between 1991 and 1995, and between 2000 and 2005. <sep><sep> A program for an Alternative Economy where the focus is on creating jobs and agricultural reform. <sep><sep> They started by explaining how during elections, the Alliance deliberately claimed that there were only "economic difficulties," but they didn't describe the depth of the crisis. <sep><sep> Last Sunday, three LALIT groups distributed leaflets in Piton, Riviere du Rempart, and Cottage. <sep><sep> But at the same time, this strategy must be built on existing experiences. <sep><sep> He lives in Rose-Hill, and he does not understand the importance of social life in rural areas that village elections have. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So that the world knows that we do not agree to let Mauritius be destroyed, everyone's lives, society, agriculture, buildings, nature, education, everything in another country being devastated. <sep><sep> Present at the Lalit press conference were Ram Seegobin, Lindsey Collen, Cindy Clelie, Rajni Lallah, and Alain Ah-Vee. <sep><sep> This was the only way to bring progress in life. <sep><sep> And especially how it reacts when faced with a serious challenge against it. <sep><sep> All of this happened because there was a demobilization of the working class. <sep><sep> In the first dawn-light, we discovered that SMF is looking for us. <sep><sep> We also said that in the absence of a mobilization for a true alternative in the economy and development strategy, which is the Social Alliance in government. <sep><sep> On November 3, we started to find our dynamic energy. <sep><sep> To provide support to prevent Israeli colonial attacks against olive planters. <sep><sep> In the context of rising communalism, even the great progress such as the introduction of mother tongue in schools, campaigns like FTS-Lever for compensation for slavery, can bring a communal shield. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Tell us we will get a report on those who have gone. <sep><sep> and supply the basics that people have arrived in a situation where they have no food and cannot pay for transportation to go to work. <sep><sep> This law applies to all workers in the industry who work in agriculture or as craftsmen working in the reserve. <sep><sep> The more these two laws clash, the more the Prime Minister will have space to maneuver. <sep><sep> But she will say, "You can't put wood in my bus". <sep><sep> It is an economic question, as Lindsey Collen has said, and it is a question of power for the State of Zini and its allies to keep control of resources in the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> It's not a matter of 20 people coming to a meeting, 10 getting hired. <sep><sep> Together with this economic crisis, there is an ecological crisis that is also threatening our planet. <sep><sep> We are also in Mauritius, we have a territory occupied by imperialist Americans and where they use our territory to bomb innocent civilians in countries like Iraq. <sep><sep> But when all these ideas from different people come together in a brainstorming session, then it becomes a strict party. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The First International had an important role in the La Commune revolution in France in 1871. <sep><sep> Valayden announced that he believes Prime Minister Ramgoolam has "understood him". <sep><sep> Then there are artists who annoy and plunder, where plunderers are people who are trying to get a small share from this creation. <sep><sep> This means that our campaign is not just about direct donations, but it has shaped us, emphasizing the importance of difficult size adjustments when necessary. <sep><sep> Discussions revolve around ways to support the actions of the hunger strike for political prisoners and Tent Solidarity in Az Zawiya, Ramallah, Qalandia. <sep><sep> At the same time when he is issuing a decree as Commissioner BIOT for a round, it is not fully convincing. <sep><sep> And we have given LALIT activists guidelines on how to engage with colleagues at work, in a broader workplace authority. <sep><sep> There are also payment balance issues that we need to address. <sep><sep> What was it like in Mauritius, this "Historical Block"? <sep><sep> Its capital that has gone into other sectors, like tourism and hotels. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you could inform your government about our protest, we would greatly appreciate it. <sep><sep> We will reflect, understand, and eventually figure out how we can bring our fight further. <sep><sep> In the botanical garden, the fish pond smells of stagnant water and the fragile plants are withering. <sep><sep> The Pa-Bush platform led a historic battle in the Supreme Court to lift the ban that the Police and the US Embassy wanted to impose on freedom of expression. <sep><sep> We are savoring a moment of relaxation without tears and with a smile on our face. <sep><sep> We are saying we need to focus more on production. <sep><sep> In trying to persuade you, you might say "But comrade, hasn't the law stopped; have you not heard on the radio it was declared that all rights had ceased?" <sep><sep> I would like to emphasize that when we were proposing this alternative economic policy before the elections. <sep><sep> They would not have faced any challenges against capitalism. <sep><sep> As he was tired, he asked his guests for permission to rest. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> Jean Claude de L'Estrac clearly has a plan (although a bit vague) to "take over MMM" from the leadership of Paul Berenger. <sep> This is the third day that history has changed course. <sep> To maintain dynamism, they organized a small protest Day against Poverty. <sep> and then approve and sign on the basis of a version that could not be approved as it was in a foreign language; <sep> This means that it is very difficult for a union to resist this argument that employers will start the discussion as, “You know if we make more profit, then workers will earn more money.” <sep> And this is a big break for the big entrepreneurs in the middle bourgeoisie who have benefited greatly from the "democratization of the economy" policy of the PT-PMSD government. <sep> The LALIT LALIT position, for its part, finds it a tragedy that the MMM-MSM-PT-PMSD Governments have taken all this money assistance from Europe (a loving capital) to give satisfaction and make a mockery of it. <sep> They have certain capacities, including the capacity to work, the capacity to understand, the capacity to reason, and the capacity to analyze. <sep> So it is a capitalist system that is present here and, moreover, worldwide today. <sep> It has a value, this principle of quality which we call "organizational principle". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, to conclude this point, LALIT has provided a framework for its members to understand a series of economic crises and its dynamic approach to social crisis, and members have been able to promote this understanding. <sep> <sep> If you don't bend, you lose your job. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin, was invited by the Democratic Socialist Perspective in Australia to speak at the Asia Pacific International Solidarity Conference in 2005. <sep> <sep> Minister Aimée has not even replied to the letter from 5 organizations, a letter that raises questions about how we can visit Chagos, including Diego, as it is now part of the Republic. <sep> <sep> Historical bourgeoisie that has been around for 2 centuries and the working class that is emerging as a political force. <sep> <sep> There will be a meeting with Rada Kistnasamy in the morning, then with Jean Yves Dick, followed by Anne-Marie and Naheed in the afternoon, and Ally and Ram will preside on Tuesday. <sep> <sep> He did not just buy 5-Plus, but he bought RADIO ONE, went to Madagascar, and is going towards the Indian Ocean. <sep> <sep> For the first time, the Prime Minister has gained the support of the parties in his own Government, namely the Workers, PMXD, MR, Dulloo Party and Baichoo Party. <sep> <sep> It depends on an understanding of Darwin's reflective style on biological life (species do not stay fixed as if God created it) which is constantly changing, sometimes minor changes, sometimes major. <sep> <sep> Feeling tired of looking for a bicycle and a scarf, he decided to give the population a different treat: the lottery. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Because the government's sudden attack on workers in the countryside, no. <sep> <sep> It realized that unity was not enough. <sep> <sep> We do not have only a "police commission", but a program based on analysis, transitional demands, and a strategy to gain support for these demands in the process of the struggle for socialism. <sep> <sep> There is an immense wavering going on in another direction; and when a tsunami comes, it is gigantic, and it moves at an unimaginable speed – and it goes in another direction again. <sep> <sep> When Neeta Deerpalsing and Patrick Aseervaden are referring to "comrade Ashok", sometimes when Ramgoolam announces that he will "foot the bill" when Resistance loses its case in the Privy Council, sometimes even before that. <sep> <sep> But this challenge by MMM began to take shape as early as 1981. <sep> <sep> A member of LALIT was asked to speak to 100 students at the University in Lenor. <sep> <sep> When Ram and I did not return to the house in Bambous at a certain time in the evening, our neighbor, Mazor, went to Ramesh's house, pushed his gate open, and put a lightning on his balcony. <sep> <sep> There is an intellectual production where philosophical, linguistic, and biological investigations are carried out by Prof. <sep> <sep> In conclusion, fundamentally, MMM is a political party that has abandoned all the claims it had to fight for the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the inclusion of Kreol Reyone in the education system, Reunion has surpassed Mauritius in an important aspect. <sep><sep> Regularizing the situation of all inhabitants of state lands living in difficult conditions to access basic necessities such as water and electricity. <sep><sep> Stephan Saminaden was a good reporter, hence he was given the nickname "the voice of Vigier de la Tour", Jimmy Jean Louis, an excellent journalist, is working with Taher, Joel Toussaint, and Talbot. <sep><sep> There are 4 from Mauritius, and 3 from other countries. <sep><sep> But, as everyone knows, the HRC does not have the right to take a case before all legal remedies have been exhausted. <sep><sep> All these matters are settled by custom and overseen by a village chief or magistrate. <sep><sep> The Lalit party says the marriage law needs to be changed, divorce law; matrimonial laws need to be adapted to the life that women and men want to live. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin started by saying that there are so many realities, that it is difficult to just talk about a general point. <sep><sep> In the Trade Union Commission, we are discussing how LALIT activists can translate this onto work sites so that most workers understand the law sufficiently well to be able to oppose it. <sep><sep> Now, you don't need me anymore." With that said, what happens to the worker? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And remove a second time the veil of secrecy for the ultimate challenge of BAI represented by Hossen-Jean-Marie Richard-Fon Sing in Viva Voce, the owner of Radio One. <sep><sep> The public gathered in Orl Mama Bul Later, where Education for Workers is located, Gran Rivyer Nord Wes. <sep><sep> MMM has given them another amount of money, gift donations, specifically to support MMM in their struggle for independence. <sep><sep> Economic orientation has continued towards further integration into a global capitalist system, particularly European, which is currently in crisis. <sep><sep> It has no real significance because there are no measures to implement this new definition in practice. <sep><sep> There was no need for a definitive end, but it has come to an end. <sep><sep> The Zenn Lalit Group has decided to launch a campaign among the youth in Mauritius to protest against their Member of Parliament regarding the Integrated Resorts Scheme (IRS). <sep><sep> Now we find that the amount of ice in this sector is freezing. <sep><sep> 2 weeks later, they announced the launch of a "relaunch plan". <sep><sep> However, there were political disagreements: they wanted LALIT to become a real movement at a critical time, and they wanted to control the trade union movement, thinking that this would make them stand up to the trade union bureaucracy within LALIT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In collaboration with former President Cassam Uteem, an initiative is being organized to show solidarity with the people of Lebanon and Palestine. <sep><sep> And during the electoral campaign, we were saying that whether it is the Social Alliance or the MMM-MSM Alliance that takes power, they will come up with solutions to the crises that are making the working class and the underprivileged bear all the burdens. <sep><sep> However, some government officials are turning the country into "Alice in Wonderland" when the National Assembly has rejected the delivery of 70 years of individual pay slips that everyone has elected. <sep><sep> Workers who have come to work are cut off from all social benefits. <sep><sep> Consequently, it prevents us from reaching the aid we deserve. <sep><sep> In the way that the Chagossians have the right to return with dignity, it is through the right to return that Morisians have. <sep><sep> Here in Palestine and in Israel, they call it Settlement. <sep><sep> "One cannot call what is happening a camp when it is the Israeli State that is overseeing the Palestinians," said Alain Ah-Vee. <sep><sep> With him, an endless love for all children, all children indiscriminately, has also disappeared. <sep><sep> So, when a political party puts its program among the people's suffering, it is showing an attachment to that program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So it is not surprising that people are turning their backs on these 2 alliances. <sep> Ambassador Sid Afrik in Israel spoke on Israeli TV last Sunday and nearly spoke out against a possible boycott against Israel. <sep> That is to say the big uncles, fathers, patriarchs in the family. <sep> MMM after a beautiful argument on oriental languages and Catholic schools. <sep> Instead, Paul Berenger condemned the patron's attitude towards the workers in that factory. <sep> He is not going in the direction of what energy will be best for the future of people, for future generations, and for the liberation of land for food production. <sep> And he has drawn parallels with the Chagossians in Mauritius who are also, because of the US/UK occupation, becoming strangers to the land where they used to live. <sep> The worker class does not favor the working class, and he says that someone is protecting it. <sep> Now that 20% of the shares in the mill are held by SIT (which represents planters and workers), today, the Ramgoolam government wants the big planters to get "direct" shares. <sep> The crisis in Mauritius could become very serious because there is no alternative economy preparing on a large scale. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For Rama Sithanen, this is a "cost of separation". <sep><sep> And today we are seeing in which direction to raise our voice for it to be more effective. <sep><sep> 2. There is a fight to gain new rights, meaning rights that do not exist yet but that can be gained. <sep><sep> He then became president of the board and general manager, a president with executive power. <sep><sep> He, Yosi and their eleven companions decided to regroup in the country Toulsiwala and from there launch an attack around Bandoukland before going to fight to the death in the swamp of Samazeste Toupoumwa. <sep><sep> Currently, which country has the strongest lobby in Marois? <sep><sep> So, we do not need to take his happy advice, which is only for him. <sep><sep> So, what is important for everyone here today, we are not calm anymore. <sep><sep> On Saturday 9 February, the People's University organized a Round Table on the theme "Violence against Women: A New Look", 10 a.m, Kirpip Council Hall. <sep><sep> G. Duval to leave the PMSD and start a Gaetan Duval Party. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They both had a tiring day and Kamini especially seemed more affected. <sep><sep> But Mandel made us understand that the ideologies coexist together, like feudal, bourgeois, and proletariat ideologies in 19th century France. <sep><sep> The Easternist method to mask systemic crisis and create an illusion of growth is so critical and heartless that it has precipitated all kinds of political crises within the Social Alliance. <sep><sep> And we have time to cover the real implications in a way that we, Marxists, find "economics," a very useful way. <sep><sep> This marks the first time that LPT has embarked on this journey since a turning point in the beginning of the language war for Creole, because in 2012 Creole language has finally been introduced in government schools. <sep><sep> The school system is theoretically formalized, systematized, organized, and intellectually developed for natural language development. <sep><sep> 1 billion people had already voted for food security before. <sep><sep> The Zini government should have reduced industrial emissions by 7% because they are responsible for emitting more than 25% of carbon dioxide in the world. <sep><sep> There have been a series of articles signed by different members of the Youth Militants, the MMM youth, in the Mauritian Forum expressing different positions from Lalini Berenger. <sep><sep> After the occupation of Afghanistan, the Zini government's tactic was to support the warlords in the north of Afghanistan. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Life as a social entity with family, children, other interests, is directly influenced by an external force, that is, the company for which one works, the manager, the director. <sep> <sep> Speaking of Palestinian DAYERI, Ragini Kistnasamy, tell me. <sep> <sep> Colonialist countries often say that the language in their colony is 'inferior'. <sep> <sep> Secondly, they commercialize it in a way which allows them to control the planters who use it to produce food. <sep> <sep> The Kafkaesque case of Lindsey and Ram began 16 months after R.Seegobin received a visit from the police at home. <sep> <sep> The revolution, according to V.Serge, always represents an energy, a hope, and a first true attempt, after 100 days of the Paris Commune, 35 years ago, for the working class to take power. <sep> <sep> I've heard many comrades talk about it here, very interesting. <sep> <sep> Since the Pearl Medine strike and the "new system" in Anna, and the Desam strike of 1971, have continued throughout the 1970s. <sep> <sep> Everything we in LALIT have been saying for a long time, now even many bourgeois economists agree. <sep> <sep> Their campaign was based on freedom, promises to create peace among the population, they created a cause of 'drawing swords into scabbards', they covered up where people were dying of hunger. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many parents think that a child already knows his first language well enough when he enters school, so it is not necessary for him to learn that language in school. <sep><sep> Due to Jericho's economic development, it would close its eyes to social problems; because if it did not, at the same time, develop a national identity where each Jericho citizen would realize that he is a Creole above all, a citizen of the new world, a new culture, racial conflicts would continue. <sep><sep> Against the slack police control of families, against the social inequalities that make families with money able to go quietly live in another country, against a law that incriminates men also for complicity. <sep><sep> The statistics office said that in 2002, the unemployment rate was 9.8% with 51,000 unemployed. <sep><sep> This means that the government has started acting in a coherent way. <sep><sep> Where they used to find sugar cane plantations, they now find of social classes. <sep><sep> There was a cultural group called Soley Ruz associated with MMMSP and a cultural group called Morisyen associated with Lel Gos, in which Rama Poonoosamy often participated. <sep><sep> Carol Benson said there were many details involved, because they need to measure themselves, calculate themselves. <sep><sep> They do not agree to a secret ballot for the strike. <sep><sep> Timmy told his daughter that she could live in her parents' house but Kamla preferred to rent a small house to maintain her independence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mr. Assirvaden has said that 25,000 menaces represent 125,000 people who will not be affected by the increase in CEB rates addressed to subscribers. <sep> It would have been a normal reaction but not with a tearful occupation. <sep> And Le Matinal, he gets a "big" government advertisement. <sep> He and Balram had five children, but his children gave him only two children, Timinn and Omar. <sep> And during a revolution: that greatness of spirit, that love for humanity, that courage, a certain madness, a spirit of independence, honesty, a revolutionary patience. <sep> It is clear that this demonstrates the pro-imperialist and pro-bourgeois role that the PMSD has come to represent. <sep> This will introduce linguistics faculty (for reflection at the sub-level) for the children. <sep> Other fundamentalists attacked Lindsey Collen when, on behalf of LALIT, she took a stand against the requirement that Ministers swear an oath by saying "So help me God" in a country that is supposedly secular. <sep> It is not true because in a capitalist system what the unions can do or win, it stops when the boss starts his dividends. <sep> In general, it creates conditions for a political unity wider towards socialism, strengthening mobilization on the basis of demands with a argument of class equality and popular emancipation popularized and reinforced. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Until the Mauritius government acted in a very complicit manner with imperialist powers, Great Britain and the USA. <sep> <sep> In America, when they speak of the "subprime" problem that caused banks to start falling one after the other, gradually throughout the world, the earth lost its value. <sep> <sep> We need to look at it, each one interpreting it according to their own understanding. <sep> <sep> At some point workers realize that they will have to find a way forward, such as LALIT, which consistently favors its class. <sep> <sep> Since 1976, MMM had control over all municipalities. Starting in 2005, the Labor Party took control of everything. <sep> <sep> But in Mauritius and in many other colonies, there is a Colonial State that has power over all social classes. <sep> <sep> Through Revi, website, coordination and visits to members. <sep> <sep> There is a course of action that Vasant Bunwaree would want to take to bring about some progress in education. <sep> <sep> Media engagement in schools, it's not just a matter of "Which media should help children get better results?" (Clearly all studies in the world, as you know, already prove that the mother tongue as a medium of instruction. <sep> <sep> It is a program where a guest comments on politics during a week that has just passed, in a fairly broad perspective. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the Americas and Brazil, there is a trend towards using maize and soybeans for ethanol production, and for planting vegetables, including sugar cane, for ethanol production. <sep><sep> This is done through what we call "block" farming. <sep><sep> So during one week, there was only this phrase: there should be no common reaction. <sep><sep> * "Social" division, where only a minority of people who "can" fill certain specialized functions in society, and the majority of people cannot participate in them. <sep><sep> No government has taken into consideration how to modernize and also keep employment. <sep><sep> Today, when Minister Sithanen challenges Berenger to present a document to address the economic crisis. <sep><sep> we vote for a political party, believing it will bring benefits to the class of people who voted for it, but what do we find? <sep><sep> When we experience different resistances, this can help us in dialogues with those people who, in their ignorance, always maintain that Creole is essentially a "vulgar" language, essentially "informal", "street language". <sep><sep> We are witnessing a kind of "Lia state" between political parties today. <sep><sep> Only the wish for people to look only at his side with lawyers and beautiful clothes, his side as he is with his nice clothes, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the birth of the Movement for the Liberation of Women, we have described patriarchy, denounced it, and taken action to end violence against women. <sep><sep> Workers are starting to realize through their participation in the trade union struggle the problems they are facing at work, problems they are facing in managing their households, problems they are facing in finding a place they can afford to pay for, it is not an individual problem. <sep><sep> Some are debating ways to maintain profitability, others are looking for ways to have their 'say', workers are debating to keep their employment and prevent working conditions from deteriorating. <sep><sep> There is also a problem here, as many of these institutions are simultaneously being discredited, like the Police, the Judiciary, the EC, and the ICAC. <sep><sep> There is massive investment in the manufacturing of weapons and it demands a lot of energy. <sep><sep> We do not want our class to end up in the drug trade mess we are in! <sep><sep> And ironically, the main concern, Rehanna Ameer also thanked Berenger as well as Ramgoolam for his reinstatement. <sep><sep> Because it is a form of development that brings stable employment, food security, a form of development that can build a modern economy, and that is in the interest of everyone who works to live. <sep><sep> While the other political forces and commentators await "Operation Kamajeet", then cry scandal. <sep><sep> Families, who had come to visit them, were happily satisfied. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We must search for the blanket in the Kaya sea where it was in the polyester seawater. <sep>
<sep> We say this, because when we see what is happening in the world with the crisis that exists in the capitalist system, we find that today the enemy, the enemy of people, is beginning to understand that the crisis that the capitalist system is causing is happening today. <sep>
<sep> It's not a "concept" that we are demystifying, but a reality that we are starting to find. <sep>
<sep> Because in the workers' movement, there are all kinds of MLC, GWF, all kinds of organizations. <sep>
<sep> He knows that the external administrator means getting ready for privatization, putting emphasis on "productivity," "profitability," so that a strategic partner is interested. <sep>
<sep> He said that it is not possible that he had put on the blanket, because he was in the hospital at the time. <sep>

<sep> A person who owns a small business to tell you he is also a "people" like you; he may not respect working hours, he may not respect the rights of the people he employs, he may not pay according to the Remuneration Order, he may exploit you, but he is a "people" like you. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As Jugnauth to actively accelerate the process of integrating the Mauritian economy into the global capitalist system through the implementation of procedures to privatize several sectors such as Telecom, postal services, and CEB. <sep><sep> Linguistic description of the Creole languages: phonology, morpho-syntax, etymology, lexicon. <sep><sep> In addition to our political campaign for the recognition of Creole languages at all levels that has continued since 2011: <sep><sep> We can note that, as usual, there is a lack of reference to the "Republic" from both the Government and the Opposition. <sep><sep> Jean Yves Dick said that the mother tongue is important in education, where the cognitive development of all children is crucial, but it is also important where democratic, meaning more people participate in political life, whether in Parliament and Municipal, whether in associations. <sep><sep> Also, we say it is only the beginning of a victory when Creole enters as a judge. <sep><sep> Not only did he take control over and direct all offices, he also wanted all other leaders in neighboring countries to look to him for advice. <sep><sep> He criticized, "When you follow Tengur, the government and Minister Gokhool, there is a very deep malaise. <sep><sep> If we believe in our program and strategy, then our duty will be to give him full power to become real, and for this, we need to framework, we need to just become better frame, and we need to recruit new talent. <sep><sep> And as part of the program, it has these 3 things: analyze, demand or claim - things that, if we support, will really bring us forward. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsay Morvan, communication manager for PMSD, says she supports Lemer on this point, as well as the issue of the budget deficit. <sep> <sep> This reinforces the strong idea that Creole is "bad" in society. <sep> <sep> Today's new piece, this fragmented union movement is clearly gaining ground in Ramgoolam's government. <sep> <sep> However, through their mobilization, they have ensured peace, and have even gained much more peace than other working-class sectors. <sep> <sep> The symbol Yannick has used to describe the problem with "nationalism" as an ideology, as a weapon to fight against imperialism, is very strong. <sep> <sep> He has said that for all its work, such as cultivating bananas, promoting the mother tongue, and promoting adult literacy, he congratulated the LPT for this. <sep> <sep> And to develop a progressive political consciousness, we need to be able to handle a language well, our mother tongue, preferably orally and in writing. <sep> <sep> Other people, in the past, used to tell stories in meetings, used to go fishing in Kolonnday to get food for their families. <sep> <sep> There is a competition among the union leaders for leadership. <sep> <sep> Minister of Education Gokhool, and later Minister Bunwaree, have come up with plans to increase competition within schools and colleges, and to create unrest in all areas of schools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Tab Rond event was organized by JUSTICE on the occasion of HUMAN RIGHTS DAY. <sep><sep> LPT is announcing a week-long activity starting Monday 20th - Monday 26th June with the theme "Art for Freedom, Against Repression". <sep><sep> These 5 points have nothing to do with the autopsy at all. <sep><sep> So, all of you, you support the American military base on Diego Garcia if you get a good deal and/or price for the lease, if you get preferential treatment to supply Diego. <sep><sep> What we find deserving after independence is a new State (with power to dictate the bourgeoisie until a certain extent) and which should act as a base for developing a new bourgeoisie through a fragile State, that is to say to change the composition of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Socialist and Labour Parties, the parties that were supposed to be with the working class, have all been exposed in a short time. <sep><sep> In France, LCR has even entered the presidential campaign - Krivine, Besancenot. <sep><sep> One of these main themes is Diego and Chagos. <sep><sep> CTSP, we have brought a fight against CT Power, on an environmental basis. <sep><sep> This insightful session was guided by Rajni Lallah who made an exposition on the differences between LALIT and other political parties in Mauritius, especially the ruling parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I remember Mrs. Thatcher in England, she used to say bring about a single law. <sep> <sep> They all realized that they were taking a big risk. <sep> <sep> - Karann, stop talking nonsense! Don't make Princess Prathna wait. <sep> <sep> Today the potential for an epidemic of malaria has increased greatly due to the high number of Mauritians leaving the country and working abroad. <sep> <sep> In the report on the Group Bhunjun's negotiations with the government to present a 15-year deal. <sep> <sep> There were also clips of Pink Floyd's former member Roger Waters singing "We shall overcome" featuring images with LALIT member Ragini Kistnasamy when she participated in the Gaza Freedom March in 2009. <sep> <sep> Among the eleven resignations, four of them did not want to sit on the Central Committee when they were elected in the General Assembly of Lalit Members in February 2004, these are Dany Marie, Ian Jacob, Nicholas Ragoonauth and Michel Chifonne. <sep> <sep> We have this analysis on the fate of the bourgeoisie, so let's see how the MSM fits into this analysis: The fate of the bourgeoisie, as we know, was the Labor Party in the 1950s and 1960s and it developed after Independence. <sep> <sep> Lindsey presented the program for our Conference on March 12. <sep> <sep> But we found that these two concepts cannot be explained entirely, except that the country has entered into a "systemic crisis". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not only does the Parliamentary Opposition continue to remain divided, but they also appear more interested in who will become the next Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> It was in February 2004 that we became aware that Ashok Subron was doing paid work for other trade federations, such as GSA. <sep> <sep> Economically, socially, and politically. <sep> <sep> At the same time, in the Samazeste Toupoumwa sector, there was an extraordinary meeting because the protest movement was starting to destabilize businesses. <sep> <sep> What will happen if workers make their lives at work run smoothly? <sep> <sep> However, all these cries have generated a great dynamic in favor of recognizing Palestine. <sep> <sep> You don't deserve to crawl in my womb, grieving mother. <sep> <sep> And I would like to see everyone who didn't take the floor to regret, or else find a moment in the second plenary session yesterday. <sep> <sep> We are talking about our genetic capacity as human beings to master language in a collective way. <sep> <sep> They succeeded in this task, but they did not have the power, even if they managed to elect a majority to the Central Committee and even take the MMM Political Bureau. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The sea was filled with sand and also members of Lalit, PT, MMM, and MSM. <sep> But, meanwhile, there is also a reality that we find with every election in Mauritius. <sep> In their meeting called "Thank-You Meeting", the only person who appeared was thanking, was Nita Deerpal-singh. <sep> a criticism against bourgeois ideologies such as Adam Smith and Ricardo who were thought to have great, great intellectual capacity, but who ended up thinking illogically about the capitalist system, and a criticism against "false socialist brothers". <sep> There is an organization that, without thinking, demands a female guard at every 24-hour station. <sep> There was a cooling off period when there was a discussion between Ramgoolam-Bérenger. <sep> Especially in his previous declaration broadcast by MBC, he believed that there could be a "consensus" on the proposed text. <sep> that has laid the foundation for all our work on Palestine this year, such as Vey and other conscientious work with other organizations. <sep> Lalit's political mainstream has focused on whether a PE teacher working at the MITD, an institution under his Ministry, has had a sexual relationship with a minor or not. <sep> The year 2012 was characterized by several LALIT seminars, all year long, each on an important point for LALIT's actions: There was our 2-day conference on "strategies": Is Mauritius-ism really fighting communalism? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> By rushing through the information in yesterday's newspaper, we missed the Conference. <sep><sep> Another factor that could have a negative impact, is that given the lack of any economic alternatives to the crisis, they were all forced to defend the existing system. <sep><sep> Initially, men who were not used to dealing with women, would often misunderstand that if they didn't pay attention Madam Balram would fire them and place them in her pocket. <sep><sep> Speaking of which, we often find teachers using a nursery rhyme like 'London Bridge is falling down' to teach certain language aspects, mainly due to its repetitive structure. <sep><sep> LALIT delegated me to go, that was in 2007, less than a year after Rafael Correa's election. <sep><sep> This is a dangerous and xenophobic attitude that goes against the principle of worker's unity in Mauritius and other countries. <sep><sep> Measures to encourage SMEs, should lead to a large number of entrepreneurs, a large number of micro-capitalists: but we all know that after 4 years, 80% of SMEs declare bankruptcy and disappear. <sep><sep> Q: Comrade Yves: I have 2 questions, why isn't LALIT too active in mobilizing classes? <sep><sep> Out of the 16 women candidates in these 2 alliances, 7 came out first among 3 lists, 5 came out second, and only 4 third. <sep><sep> Eating, drinking and central cafe in this region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Education for Workers is organizing an African Literature Round Table at its headquarters, GRNW, Port-Louis, on Wednesday, 14th December, from 6.00 - 9.00 P.M. <sep><sep> And all measures to ensure short-term profitability of the establishment without sacrificing quality lead to a disaster; and for sugar cane planters, who have found themselves trapped by the establishment's pricing, it will be a real catastrophe. <sep><sep> And, we are finding ourselves in a space about 3 years ago, in 1977 MMMSP shot Lotus, 1978 Lel Gos. <sep><sep> Despite all the diplomatic efforts that the Government is making, the crisis in the Sugar Industry has confirmed, and now it is the Ministry that is in question. <sep><sep> In Jericho, the routine gives balance, the habit of following habit without fatigue. <sep><sep> He was a boss (an "executive manager") overseeing many people in the network in the region that Google calls MENA (Middle East and North Africa). <sep><sep> Employment Relations Bill: News Archives Page 8, 3rd September 2007, also under Documents. <sep><sep> H., C. and I take our land and we land in villages. <sep><sep> John Ashcroft, Secretary of Justice: He prosecuted companies like AT&T, Microsoft, Enterprise. <sep><sep> And yesterday, in this great mobilization, this is what has most likely allowed MMM to win the election in 1982 with a 60-0 victory. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government of PT-PMXD did not abandon the "Concessions Project Act" as implemented by the previous government, it has only been integrated into the new PPP framework. <sep><sep> (Laughter.) Is this the economy we are anticipating for Mauritius in the future? <sep><sep> Workers unite, especially when they become daily wage laborers. <sep><sep> Where the system had an interview with Joe Wilson, who Lewis Libby was threatening not to reveal a conspiracy to manufacture false reasons to start a war. <sep><sep> But there were also signs of a growing storm of regret. <sep><sep> Enemy,

representatives in various branches such as Rozil, Bambous, Ti-Rivyer, St. Pierre have helped to refocus the debates on economic crises and crises for workers and the poor. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You receive a lot of information about what is happening: what is on the Electoral Reform, on the life of the working class today, why the "Workers' State" is always in place, the importance of the government's "National Forum" on the Kreol language in education. <sep><sep> In the Muslim Personal Law: The new "regulation" only gives the Muslim Family Council more repressive power through the police. <sep><sep> The government where it will stop with such targeting, if we give it a foot. <sep><sep> There was a big demonstration like this that lasted three days on March 25, 26, and 27, 1981. <sep><sep> And demanding that all research and development be done by the Government without any influence or money from the private sector or multinational companies. <sep><sep> Paul Berenger's intention was much more motivated by a "communal leadership" than any other consideration. <sep><sep> The result of the partial election in number 7, it represents a defeat for the economic policy of MSM-MMM. <sep><sep> They not only threw out all the workers from this Establishment, but they were on a list of private sector individuals who would never get a job again. <sep><sep> And they criticize the government only on things like how it has "handled" different political issues - but it seems to convince people that if it was in the government, it would do otherwise. <sep><sep> The Indian Ocean it is a transit route between Africa and Asia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the context of a campaign for an alternative economic policy, Lalit militants in all areas have organized food drives. <sep><sep> On the occasion of World Literacy Day, Saturday 3 September, former President of the Republic, Cassam Uteem, spoke in front of 80-year-old people present in Horl Mama Bul Later, Grande Rivière Nord Wes. <sep><sep> As compensation, to close the base, and to return Diego to Mauritius. <sep><sep> A: It creates jobs indeed, but does not address the principal problem that we have just described. <sep><sep> Because of all the disorder, many institutions in the bourgeois State, which are relatively more democratic, are discredited: parliament, judiciary, trade unions--when it comes to the private sector, the army, the police are not doing well. <sep><sep> Families have said that we are eating on Fridays to economize. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, our relationship with it has its own history, a rather conservative history, even if independent from the colonial state, even if independent from the momentary oppressing government. <sep><sep> And the price, it is not personally the workers who set the price. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we already have a program that we have developed "For an alternative economic policy" in response to the crisis. <sep><sep> And if there is no redemption, especially for big criminals, then it is them, these smart men, who close off with nothing to lose, desperate and powerful, whose enemies begin to roll in prison from within. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here is a testimony on the treatment that equates to "serious mental harm," where individuals have been mentally wounded due to the Minister of Education's political actions. <sep><sep> This is mainly due to the abusive use of fossil fuels in various economic sectors, as well as in the transportation industry. <sep><sep> The colonial education system had a rather simple objective. <sep><sep> Therefore, we have engaged in a lengthy struggle against the IRA law (a law that has recognized difficult trade unions, made illegal strikes, and bureaucratized unions through the NRB and other institutions). <sep><sep> This medication effectively inhibits the action of progesterone, normally preventing uterine contractions. <sep><sep> Firstly, when the state instructed me to prepare a paper on the matter, I realized that the paper's size was too small – as you may find, there are "three sizes" in it. <sep><sep> So, it is no wonder that Paul Berenger was asking all the elderly for excuses. <sep><sep> Comrade Kisna stated that there are many newspapers in Kiba, with an English version printed and also available online. <sep><sep> All this goes to show that we, too, have our duties. <sep><sep> It was the MMM-PSM government that had rightly abolished the classification of communal issues in the census. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we talk about the internationalist struggle in Mauritius, the central role that the working class must play as a vanguard against imperialism becomes evident. <sep><sep> In reality, what is most important in the struggle is the unity of the workers. <sep><sep> With the economic and social crisis that is looming, it is likely that we will end up with a PT-MMM Government, that is, a coalition. <sep><sep> Therefore, I do not believe that within 20-25 minutes we can delve into all the depths and intricacies of this issue. <sep><sep> In each province, there are correspondents who send us news from the provinces. <sep><sep> Another reason why the Social Alliance cannot overcome the electoral crisis is the persistent crisis in education. <sep><sep> Therefore, when you take these two measures in Beedze, and put them together, they form a picture that is very concerning. <sep><sep> The Women's Strike in the prisons has been suspended since Friday, 2nd September, except in Be'er Sheva Prison. <sep><sep> It is a common struggle, a Mauritian struggle, of the entire nation, which has been won, more by the people than the working class. <sep><sep> It is not the bourgeoisie that seems eager to venture into new sectors and innovate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The reason nothing was agreed upon is because no one in the government was involved in this program. <sep><sep> Women against the Wall and Flowers against the Occupation with IWPS met during the Freedom Walk from Jenin to Jerusalem when the march arrived in the Salfit region. <sep><sep> Workers who were injured in our region are not employed. <sep><sep> For LPT, Alain Ah-Vee coined the phrase on creativity in Creole. <sep><sep> During the general strike of 1979, this was a central demand. <sep><sep> Bijou Rama Sithanen on behalf of the Social Alliance, presented a plan focused solely on "riding out" the global economic crisis. <sep><sep> All systems are dependent on the CONDITION that prisoners behave well. <sep><sep> (Perhaps, it is not a time to cast votes, as we predict that there will be breakdowns ahead, there will be dismissals and sanctions. <sep><sep> Another issue is that people depend a lot on imported food for nutrition, so we are suffering from price increases from outside. <sep><sep> Comrade TR has written an extraordinary analysis on “ideology” to deepen the debate that is taking place in the Detid Group. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation for the closed military base on Diego Garcia, to reintegrate Chagos into the Republic of Mauritius, to provide compensation to the Chagossians, and to allow them the right to return to Chagos is a unified issue. <sep><sep> Today, we must remember what we know unconsciously. <sep><sep> And just as a worker brings a case against his employer, so the employer also brings a case against the worker. <sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna had a meeting with a delegation from PSUVJ which has 2 million members (which is just the number of members in its youth section) among a population of 27 million, including 200,000 very active youths. <sep><sep> The solution they propose to solve all the problems in the country is to have General Elections in one place, and to increase Law and Order in another place. <sep><sep> Facing communal and religious lobby groups, Navin Ramgoolam gave a speech rather to reassure that it is the government that supported CT Power's appeal against the decision of the EIA Committee to halt this process. <sep><sep> One example is through the collaboration of Catholic and dominant religious confessional schools in Mauritius. <sep><sep> By the end of 2010, 10% of the electricity will be generated from wind farms. <sep><sep> Yesterday, for example, I had a discussion with colleagues who are starting a union in a private school in Clavis. <sep><sep> These new typhoons were indeed favored by the State, despite the historical bourgeoisie; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before his speech, in his introduction, Lindsey Collen, who was presiding in the name of Lalit, said that today, when Jean Claude Bibi takes the floor. <sep>
<sep> Lindsey Collen, member of the Central Committee of Lalit, has just returned from a fellowship at the Technical University of Berlin in Germany. <sep>
<sep> I attribute much of this to another activist, who has been in the union since before the direction was taken: Gassen Murugan. <sep>
<sep> The rupee is rapidly depreciating against the euro, the pound sterling, the Australian dollar, and the South African rand, and this is leading to inflation. <sep>
<sep> Recently we are finding that he is trying to associate himself with a little protest against the increase in water prices. <sep>
<sep> This is also a sign that the Lalit Party is known for. <sep>
<sep> However, among union leaders, Tulsiraj Benydin publicly stated that he disassociates himself. <sep>
<sep> He is bringing a political struggle, in order to regain the political dominance he had before, in the "liberal" era. <sep>
<sep> Now, all attempts to repair the system have not been able to progress. <sep>
<sep> Thirdly, when talking about an increase in FDI (foreign investment), it is also considered between currencies, so a 25% depreciation of the rupee also artificially inflates it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With its attacks on wages, on social rights, with rising prices, unemployment, insecurity, many young people see no hope in the future, there is a social crisis going on. <sep> <sep> But we are not interested in getting involved in a debate with those who are just a group of individuals. <sep> <sep> Clearly he could be reading the short articles in the newspapers. <sep> <sep> Our political program, it starts from where we are today, and it describes the path towards a possibility of a strictly structured society, towards a socialist revolution where there is a complete overturn of the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> A "service" a mini van and it runs like a taxi train system in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> I know that Tantinn Ganga and Tonton Ralph consider me somewhat like their own child. <sep> <sep> and that it is perfectly possible to provide cultural empowerment to our children when we also make references to local legends and beliefs. <sep> <sep> We even have a small goal from our movie "For an Alternative Economy" on the web, a small ad. <sep> <sep> Like a raised flag, finding too many people in the streets, saying that we need to stop protesting today and “the constitution is suspended”, how can we hear this information. <sep> <sep> After several attempts to get out of the impasse, Timi proposed a council update during a one hour break. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have our website, on which we publish our program, we have a news section, a documentation section, an audio section, and a video section. <sep><sep> Because of this, all the colleagues are becoming good friends. <sep><sep> And for the first time, people from MIE, University of Mauritius, Playgroup, LPT, BEC are working together with the same objective of introducing the Mauritian Creole language into the school system. <sep><sep> But starting from 1980, when the general elections were nearing, the leadership of the MMM started changing its position towards what it called " Western imperialists". <sep><sep> Unfortunately, the more baboons like a labor dispute occurs to establish a framework in middle management where the bank increases its revenue allocation from 1 million rupees (13 bunches of bananas per worker earning less than Rs6,000 per month). <sep><sep> So, there are all the ingredients for a challenge to the Gokhool Plan. <sep><sep> We analyze the situation through reports on social classes, the situation in each social class and how each social class reacts to the real situation. <sep><sep> But there is still a great mobilization to implement a clear strategy. There has been a great mobilization to overthrow Ben Ali, Hosni Mubarak, Gaddafi, Saleh, Assad. <sep><sep> But if he is using such force, it is because there is an emergency system that aspired to the aspirations of the Tunisian people and many of its leaders. <sep><sep> If the MMM and PTR agree to share power, with the Cehl Meeah campaign, it will benefit Berenger more, as he portrays himself as a leader of minorities, and this has been the case since 1983. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Tuesday 26 August, a journalist from 5-Plus contacted Lindsey Collen for a statement following the serious case of violence against Sandra O'Reilly. <sep><sep> While there is a struggle taking place in every country against national bourgeoisie, an international movement is necessary to confront the existing state system that protects, defends, and consolidates the reign of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Our participation is always based on a program - not on "if we choose we will put a column in front of our door". <sep><sep> As the ceremony unfolds, in the first row of the ranks, full of emotional ties, tears flow, eyes are fixed on the new priest, Father Martin King. <sep><sep> So, it is a crisis of the global financial system, and this is the system that is failing. <sep><sep> But it is the politics of their government, the political program of the ruling parties. <sep><sep> It is interesting to note that when we put a lot of effort into developing our own media and strictly communicating with people, this has not diminished our presence in traditional media. <sep><sep> They say, in the trade union movement, there are people who practice "class struggle trade unionism". <sep><sep> But, they say that it is impossible to make the conversion in time to prevent the "tipping-point" towards the catastrophe of "global warming" unless we use more nuclear energy. <sep><sep> We find them invading countries like Iraq and occupying them militarily. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But we find it politically difficult to fight for universal human rights on the Welfare State together with MMM and MSM, which we have learned through the press to present in the National Platform. <sep><sep> To go to school, being a true explorer every day. <sep><sep> He's raising a billion rupees for the Airport (a fund for direct flights with a private company) and not in the Ministry of Infrastructure that will employ workers. <sep><sep> Everyone was busy, everyone was entertaining except for a lady around fifty who seemed much older. <sep><sep> So it is important for us to realize the importance of our party, to enlarge it in terms of number of cadres, to follow the development of its structure, to strengthen it. <sep><sep> That means that 25 years ago there were discussions and consultations on issues that are exactly blocking agricultural diversification and food production, and today in 2005 we are still facing the same issues. <sep><sep> You will find in this last phase, trade unions such as the Nursing Association which brings together nurses and midwives and where GTU, primary school teachers, have come together to support this Bill. <sep><sep> Jacques Rivet wrote a rare "beef" in Le Mauricien to say he has sent a warning shot to Lettre de L'Ocean Indien, and has looked to his lawyers for what he calls "kamikazes" of La Voix Kreol. <sep><sep> It shows that until when there are no ideological campaigns based on this kind of concept, many people have come to accept that it is perfectly normal for us to consider 'Mauritianism' as something that cannot be touched. <sep><sep> In the Middle East, people took to the streets, yes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> -Oupa Lehulere from South Africa (spoke about the role of political parties during a crisis). <sep><sep> The Central Committee agreed, then we held a Round Table, a State of Lies. <sep><sep> When we were on the lake to Checkpoint, a truck with a Palestinian number plate (writing in green on white) arrived to pass the Checkpoint. <sep><sep> What other forces are working to challenge the system that is leading to poverty, which is responsible for the exploitation of the working class. <sep><sep> This affects the entire economy of Mauritius, all sectors are affected, all production apparatus is affected. <sep><sep> Finally, it was said that when Mauritius gained independence: that's when the problems started. <sep><sep> Lalit militants, members of the Auguste Follet Trade Union Federation, Rashid Imrith, Wakil Lalloo, Faizal Begun. <sep><sep> Their only quarrel is that this "way of life" criterion used to classify people is not an objective criterion and they challenge the fact that the system is based on 1972 population figures.” <sep><sep> LK, a woman and her contribution to bringing about a Palestinian cause was important. <sep><sep> She announced that the Lesotho border with Gaza, the Rafah crossing, would be closed to public circulation due to the situation at the border. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But what happened, always through the law (later I will explain how "law" does this), what the law says, when there is a Monarchy everyone gives people "sympathy". <sep><sep> Sometimes it believed it was almost the law that had come on a rose, each one wrote this on a rose block, which he had brought. <sep><sep> Everyone was already against British and American visas concerning Chagos and Diego. <sep><sep> Is everything that PMO is doing concerning Chagos a secret as announced in their legal strategy? <sep><sep> LALIT is here to give a direction, to come up with a mobilization program that will strengthen the working class in this struggle. <sep><sep> His own hard work, what was important to him, has become a commodity for himself, he sells it. <sep><sep> Most people still call it Sanndia but the boy used to know his name. <sep><sep> We expect our campaign to gain more support for the food crisis. <sep><sep> There is no duty that scientific content should be taught in a language that children understand, that it is used daily, that it is mastered 100%. <sep><sep> It is young boys and girls in Tur d'Ebene who are doing this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT has a strong presence in the media: radio, newspapers. <sep><sep> They bring out the criterion of proximity, it is a disadvantage for the villagers. <sep><sep> Besides the government's accommodation that the workers have been generously given, the Sugar Industry's employers are continuing to benefit greatly from construction projects, which make it easier for them to convert and sell their land. <sep><sep> Similarly, Berenger demonstrates that he can form an alliance with the PT and MSM or go it alone in the elections. <sep><sep> The way they see what is happening in Sri Lanka has masked the real extent of the ongoing conflict. <sep><sep> Since independence, Government after Government have supported the Sugar Industry, whilst at the same time encouraging other sectors such as the Agro industry and the Textile and garment sector, as well as other sectors that depend on the foreign market. <sep><sep> This means that there is an importance to a political program, and there is also an importance to a strategy to make the program a reality. <sep><sep> It has brought animation in Creole to all of the big movements that were present in the country in the 1970s and 1980s. <sep><sep> Especially, given the treatment that recent alliances are getting, we can expect that there will be even less opposition in Parliament. <sep><sep> On the other hand, Samazeste has started to carry out his large project that his first Manifesto outlined: creating a solar farm that never stops running. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In an independent manner, since the organization of working class is not a part of strict organizations such as unions and other working-class organizations.<sep><sep> 26th September 2011 - Resignation of 6 MSM ministers. Pravind Jugnauth, in his press conference, stated that his party is always loyal to the Prime Minister (who was not in the country at that time) and that they always remain in the Alliance Future.<sep><sep> So, in that case, what kind of political work can LALIT members do in unions?<sep><sep> At that time, the press was focused on the conflict over the Lakor Medpoint, on power sharing between the President and the Prime Minister.<sep><sep> We have launched our campaign to stop institutionalized communalism in the electoral system in 1982, when 60 out of 60 seats were won. Then we brought mobilization of Movman Kont Kominalis (MAC) in 1994.<sep><sep> On average, a mill cranes are being shut down each year, and reduction in tax for artisans; the salary of workers and artisans has continued to increase, at the same time as the tranquility and security of the majority of the population still remains a secret. <sep><sep> When the worker Jean-Marie Richard offers to pull the George Legallant poem book and when in the same meeting Gordon-Gentil arranges a meeting between Legallant and Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> We have met WOSA from South Africa, an independent organization in Reunion, a delegate from the FDC in Comoros, an activist from Madagascar.<sep><sep> That is to say, they say that they can only be going to other islands in Chagos, not Diego Garcia itself. <sep><sep> Firstly, there is WIN and its WIP committee, which has a Plan A, announced by Jane Valls, which is to rally 50,000 signatories to claim a seat in 3 families for the upcoming elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Raiding The House, and I'm thinking for the first time since I've been in Israel and Palestine, I haven't found a soldier or a jeep. <sep><sep> But, what's happening in China is quite interesting. <sep><sep> However, in the last 10-20 years, the enemies of our enemies have gone towards a situation where the operations of the imperialist private companies are attacked. <sep><sep> Following the discussions with the members of LALIT, Lindsey Collen was invited to speak about electoral reform at a university in Lenor. <sep><sep> Today, we may say that at last history is giving us reason for this struggle. <sep><sep> And when we will see the other alliances, the Alliance for the Future, we'll find out if they deserve the trust of others more or less. <sep><sep> * Shooting all language criteria that prevent regular people from taking a stand in elections. <sep><sep> DSP, LCR, Maron, PT, have moved from a Marxist political organization towards a fairly large anti-capitalist movement. <sep><sep> Also, for a local invite, Jean Claude Bibi, who had already spoken at our international theoretical seminar. <sep><sep> Indeed, furthermore, he is paid half once. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You will find that most of the fairy tales in the development concept, more particularly in the actual economic system, pose a lot of questions about the relationship between the MID and the messy political and moral principles in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> But, before they get angry, the artisans and workers' union had already met with the dockers and transport workers, with their union. <sep> <sep> Meaning a document to explain its policy on PPP issues. <sep> <sep> When he was five, he went to primary school in his village, not far from his house. <sep> <sep> Thus, the next generation, already has access to a heritage, informed by an understanding of how to come. <sep> <sep> They are closer to Berenger's speech on Diego, and De l'Estrac (who was the bridge between the Workers and the MMM) and who became the president of the COI. <sep> <sep> The analysis that I will describe is an analysis that has been developed by LALIT, especially by comrade Ram and Lindsey. <sep> <sep> So, it is the only thing that can bring us together. <sep> <sep> And today there are additional dances that private companies in the hotel industry, tourism, freeport, etc., can do. <sep> <sep> He said that he feels that it is total hypocrisy of the Israeli state deeply committed to someone who has gone to Palestine, when he hears the strong propaganda of Israel as if he is lucky to "protect civilians". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With a clear understanding of how Trotsky represented a necessary position for the working class party on the world stage, in order to provide the means to carry out the party's revolutionary ambitions. <sep><sep> The situation was absurd, making it even more difficult to resist. <sep><sep> In the context of municipal elections, they continue with forums, meetings, and the distribution of leaflets to start a debate on an alternative economy. <sep><sep> From the smallest in England to the largest strikes and demonstrations in Lagos. <sep><sep> He said he would only discuss "electoral reform" with Ramgoolam, nothing else. <sep><sep> Nevertheless, everyone in Mauritius understood why they were protesting. <sep><sep> Negev Prison was a military prison with certain privileges such as a phone. <sep><sep> However, remarkably, its two doors were turning black from a distance. <sep><sep> Can we imagine 4 to 5 people in the Central Committee at that time having a certain degree of autonomy compared to the Central Committee? <sep><sep> (1) The bourgeoisie's interest, particularly its secretive oligarchy, and <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a moderate democratic system where we elect a special monarch, a Prime Minister or even a President, once every 5 years, and we entrust him with all our power, and then he, reigns in the global interest of the bourgeoisie who finance and control him. <sep><sep> We must not believe that this level of violence is only affecting ZEP schools or schools that are not performing. <sep><sep> LALIT proposes that we vote for 4 deputies by constituency, 3 for Rodrigues and 1 for Chagos (including Diego Garcia). <sep><sep> It will proceed in the same way as the HSC results. <sep><sep> We also need to have a voice in trade unions, so that both men and women feel safe and have the right to fight against employers. <sep><sep> It is this, the class struggle that develops the possibility of a political struggle to bring socialism. <sep><sep> They have occupied a terrain traditionally occupied by socialist and revolutionary political organizations. <sep><sep> These parties do not have strict democratic structures. <sep><sep> They come with their comprehensive solutions in order to keep the system safe. <sep><sep> However, you know, no matter what the Government says, when it is composed, when it is in trouble, it can always change what has been agreed upon. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Translation: <sep> Thirdly, that is, in addition to a program, in addition to a strictness, the various parts must have organizational principles. <sep> <sep> The army has set up a mirror where more barbed wire stands in some places, while in other places, a single family lives in a small village that separates a Palestinian village and a settlement. <sep> <sep> in response to the proposal made by Vinesh Hookoomsing in the Creole Language Colloquium Today 2001. <sep> <sep> You are obliged, to make progress for humanity as a whole, to look at history as a whole and to consider every aspect of that whole together. <sep> <sep> over many years that guide you clear and conscious direction that will lead us to our political goal. <sep> <sep> They are desperate to correct their past mistakes and rebuild. <sep> <sep> He used to advise people for free, he used to perform services for free, he was very happy to provide services. <sep> <sep> He was able to cover a long distance every day. <sep> <sep> So, we believe we need to find a solution that not only educates people, but also leads them towards Mauritianism, as we are discussing. <sep> <sep> Colonial government of England tried to force agricultural diversification by the State imposed it on capitalist class during the second world war in 1944. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the other hand, those guys are acting foolishly. <sep><sep> nor have a say in government's interests (as much as the workers of Mauritius have done and are doing). <sep><sep> So, we have a short race going on, which is turning into a long, long marathon of history. <sep><sep> Yesterday there was a nice piece of work that Lindsey did, and I encourage everyone to go read it. <sep><sep> Then this Bengal position to form a government, because it had a majority of seats (167 out of 300 in Pakistan as a whole). <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, a member of the LALIT leadership, analyzed the current political situation in a meeting of weekend members. <sep><sep> And it is mostly the work of LALIT activists, who have mobilized all these unions for a long period since the '70s in general in the labor movement and union activism. <sep><sep> For Fanfan Tabardenn it was an ideal situation for people to realize what truly exists behind the discourse on harmony and unity in the rainbow nation. <sep><sep> Then, it goes back to Europe, but not in the Zone Ero, like Great Britain was. <sep><sep> Rights and ownership, which were gained in the Revolution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In particular, we have established a connection with the Revolutionary Socialist Party in Australia, and they have also collaborated with the Democratic Socialist Party. <sep><sep> Members are also encouraged to read the texts "Origins of the Revolutionary Socialist Party" and "Marxist Economic Definitions", both published by the RSP. <sep><sep> Whether it is the State, spending money (Keynesian solution), as it is doing today, even though the private sector is the real problem. <sep><sep> He lived on state land without electricity and water connections to adapt to the increasingly difficult lifestyle. <sep><sep> So, the boss called the workers, installed a piece of machinery that the workers are forced by law to use because the workers must follow the orders of the boss. <sep><sep> Q: Is it a problem when there is union division? <sep><sep> In 2012, there were several seminars organized by LALIT throughout the year, each focusing on an important aspect of LALIT's actions. <sep><sep> This petition was sent on October 23, and until October 31, there was no response from the Authorities. <sep><sep> We raise this issue in relation to 2005, when the PT returned to power and clearly started its "Commission for the Democratization of the Economy", a policy openly in favor of the bourgeoisie state. <sep><sep> In Issue 20, among 3 candidates of the Resistance and Alternatives, the first was Dany Marie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recently, a phone conversation with the members of the Checkpoint Watch group regarding the Palestinian situation was initiated. <sep><sep> An artist appeared in the book and told the parents that his name should start with the letter 'J'. <sep><sep> Whichever of these two alliances forms the future government, together, we need to start thinking about the necessity of a new movement strong enough to face the economic and social crisis that is looming. <sep><sep> In the past, there was a law to regulate industrial relations, that is, between the workers union and the employers. <sep><sep> Commenting on Colie Roberts, director of the Foreign Commonwealth Office, exposing a conspiracy to prevent the Chagossians from returning to their homeland, he said: “the MPA is the most effective longterm way to prevent any of the Chagos islands former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in BIOT” <sep><sep> We are asking the Minister of Family Rights, the Minister of Health, and the Minister of the Interior to take personal responsibility. <sep><sep> Especially when these conflicts between social classes, between different sections within each social class, have begun to have a clearer political expression: <sep><sep> For a SOLIDARITY CONCERT with Nitin Chinien and all victims of police brutality Sunday 29th October 2:00 at the Port Louis Theatre. <sep><sep> However, when the union is weakening, the feeling becomes more intense. <sep><sep> With the rise of textile in the colonial era, all these are disappearing and being replaced by economic partnerships between Europe and SADC, Europe and other regional blocs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT reiterates its demand for an international embargo on all arms to Israel, for a total boycott of Israel and for the immediate suspension of relations between Mauritius and Israel. <sep> In addition, they claim that the authorities have orchestrated a history by themselves, among themselves. <sep> Once a labor dispute has reached this stage, the union goes to this table to present all its claims with arguments for a salary increase and for sanctions in working conditions. <sep> 'Artists against War, for Peace' is a book that has been published by LPT following an exhibition held at Saint Mama Bul Later during the war in Iraq. <sep> At that time, in the Workers' Party, Nita Deerpalsing and Kader Sayed Hossen have, likewise, taken up the issue, even though it depends somewhat on large planters. <sep> Even in some sciences, scientific research, in agronomy and pharmaceutical matters, for example, academic research is nearly 100% controlled by the interests of multinational companies. <sep> This is a new thing, a "det" can become an "asset". <sep> There cannot be an economic policy that remains unchanged at the international level every year. <sep> The proportional battle has been taken up after independence, first by UDM, then by MMM. <sep> So it is for this reason that I say it is a ridiculous ignorance and a quite criminal ignorance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is what gives us the strength, the necessary resources, in a context where it is difficult in a society with a lot of ideological forces against us. <sep><sep> Share your life when you return there drill with soldiers to supervise the construction of the miray; <sep><sep> We will see if there are enough measures to stabilize prices, and not allow a slump to ensure capitalist profit. <sep><sep> Collective negotiations must take place between unions and employers on a regional and global basis. <sep><sep> We find attempts at ongoing artists' recuperation by the Ptr / PMSD regime. <sep><sep> And, with a little elimination, it could also announce a date for a primary teacher who wants to compete, submit translations in Creole in existing school manuals for all classes, and offer a "price" for better translations. <sep><sep> The more working class understand what is happening, the better it is for bureaucracy. <sep><sep> What the State actually is doing, however, is launching institutions that protect a few (few thousand) rich people against all odds with all resources. <sep><sep> You become something like a featherweight, a fairy that has been doing fine, but doesn’t become more than that in society. <sep><sep> Focus on an economic alternative to the problems that affect workers' lives in a negative way in Mauritius and Reunion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Australia, for example, candidates have the right to stand for election as the highest officials. <sep> <sep> A new category of worker, with many finding this work very exciting. <sep> <sep> Since becoming Prime Minister, Paul Berenger has been working towards institutionalizing and promoting communalism, integrationism, and catechism. <sep> <sep> He must finish his mission before his term ends. <sep> <sep> I believe it is important to stay ahead in a time of great environmental crisis. <sep> <sep> Not just a program in form and content, but the way the political party implements it and its program. <sep> <sep> A worker explained to me how the work pays off when cash flows in from olive sales in Israel. <sep> <sep> The conceptualization of Claud-Paul Henry was original and taught very intensely, deserving applause from the very beginning of the program to its extraordinary performance which went very well, from start to finish. <sep> <sep> It is not just the DPP that cannot do this in their work. <sep> <sep> What is interesting to note is the consistent nature of this work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, this is not an innovation for a Prime Minister of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Like the Medieval church's Pardoners who used to sell God's forgiveness. <sep><sep> When we have between 1 and 5 years, for example, our ability to produce language is at its peak. <sep><sep> In essence, it is the same position that different governments in the past have maintained on the issue of Chagos and the American military base on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Everyone and a specific practical problem concerning the Creole language. <sep><sep> It has neither means nor philosophy, nor the will to pursue a policy. <sep><sep> European Union compensation should go into a basic food production campaign, not waste like a cesspool for establishments in delivery. <sep><sep> LALIT also submitted a document to the Law Review Commission. <sep><sep> It wasn't just a strike, but a degrowth movement, from August 79 to September 80. <sep><sep> In the face of the energy crisis, LALIT has a vision to move towards renewable energy production, such as wind, solar, wave, and tidal energy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This 3.2% is for everyone earning less than Rs 5,000 per month, it is not enough to cover the increase in basic food prices. <sep><sep> We see this kind of exploitation in the slogans used by Bloc 104, such as 'I am 100% Mauritian, and you?' <sep><sep> All this was well known among party militants worldwide. <sep><sep> Only three influential people were likely to influence the LALIT vote in their newspapers. <sep><sep> They were receiving more than 10 different para-statal services just to plan. <sep><sep> It should be recognized that Timi had a kind that became his weakness; a weakness that became his strength. <sep><sep> Berenger and Aneerood Jugnauth together laid off 800 DWC workers. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy and Rajni Lallah have told Minister Seebun that MLF hopes the process will lead to the Rape Crisis Unit being set up, and make them popular by the end of the accusations being heard until March 8, International Women's Day. <sep><sep> This will immediately allow a significant leap forward in child development, literacy, and exam results at all levels. <sep><sep> These new strict democratic regulations that have emerged in the pre-revolutionary period and that are collectively ruled by a socialist revolution vision for being in power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is through a rapid centralization of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). <sep><sep> Hurnam made the call, and the legal procedures will follow their normal course. <sep><sep> This was a crucial phase, and it allowed a phase where many demonstrations developed. <sep><sep> UNESCO, the European Union (EU), and even the World Bank, are saying that the mother tongue is better. <sep><sep> It will not even require a State that will, for a while, implement socialism. <sep><sep> It has become so inaccessible that 20 years later, the editor of Time Magazine offered a good French wine to the first journalist who managed to report from Diego-mem! <sep><sep> A lot of debate has arisen in the dynamic that the Creole Federation has declared after its meeting at the communal level on the 29th of October. <sep><sep> The second is working on "terminology," a subject that the African Languages Academy is encouraging all language lovers to work on. <sep><sep> LALIT: Don't just gather, but come together to think and act together. When the time comes to work, you will realize that you need to gather a part like LALIT, which consistently favors its class. <sep><sep> Furthermore, to avoid a tax on capital gains, the Government manages to sell the business quickly before the tax is imposed, which is December 29th. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But what is most important, we are voting to decide which direction our lives will take in the next 5 years, with regard to the relationship of forces between different social classes which have conflicting interests: <sep><sep> Just as we must have a compass to navigate sanctions in the ocean, we must understand society, have a compass that understands the forces operating in time, and in a vast space, to understand what is happening. <sep><sep> And the increase in petrol prices has also affected this increase in prices. <sep><sep> This dependency on tourism is in total contradiction with the concept of "sustainable consumption and production" which is part of sustainable development and sustainable management. <sep><sep> It is very important for us to mark our departure from these opportunities in this Modi National Campaign. <sep><sep> It is a dilemma that has not been so evident in his life, he asks me where to find the resources to have two lives. <sep><sep> It is the first time that LPT is launching such a course. <sep><sep> What we find pathological in all this is the way that after they resign, Ashok Subron and Veena Dholah have contacted other members individually, have gone to see them, have called them to convince them to resign. <sep><sep> "This life was not easy,” Kamini thought. <sep><sep> We have had two of the first parts to denounce this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A ship that started in America ended up sinking in Laswis, specifically in England. <sep><sep> and David joined the anti-apartheid demonstration when Bolom Ramgoolam and Duval were imposing economic sanctions against South Africa. <sep><sep> MMM's attempt to form a "historic block" in power. <sep><sep> When we talk about the failed system, we also talk about the level of creativity of young people, I definitely believe that there is creativity that has been stifled from the beginning. <sep><sep> 3 Repeats that occurred in 2005, that is, MMM+MSM versus Alliance Sociale. <sep><sep> Erik tells me again that people need to wake up, not messages in pretty packages. <sep><sep> We are living in a period characterized by a degradation in the general situation. <sep><sep> In the 1953 elections, RM managed to elect J.Koenig in P.Wilhems and A.R.Mohamed in Port Louis, who would later form CAM. <sep><sep> So the participation of A4 had a special value as "the voice of reason in relations" with the organizers in Madagascar. <sep><sep> That is how collective bargaining is done, that is how negotiations are blocked, that is how two parties declare a dispute, at the same time they need to negotiate before they can declare a dispute, when a dispute is declared then the Minister of Labor intervenes to see if he can find a solution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What he is doing is taking the theory of Marx on economics a little further, especially what is now called macroeconomics. <sep><sep> And he went further, saying that workers should have an "Independent Working Class Foreign Policy." <sep><sep> Your wage, relative to your profit, is decreasing. <sep><sep> Because of this, our campaign will also integrate the issues that have been discussed in reality on which we have been mobilizing for a long time and where we find the need to continue fighting for the right to strike and trade union freedom. <sep><sep> and I think that the non-decisive agricultural sector should also benefit from the same quality transformation. <sep><sep> And finally, the debate is focusing on "Will the electoral reform bring the PT-MMM closer together?" "Will it break the MMM-MSM pact?" <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy regretted the way the press either did not understand the importance of this initiative, or was completely confused on the Diego question. <sep><sep> Furthermore, it was bigger, it was stronger and it was going to make its land even more beautiful. <sep><sep> However, the Prime Minister's Office continues to control the MBC, even if the Prime Minister has changed. <sep><sep> And at the same time, it is confronted by Pravind Jugnauth and his MSM in a new Alliance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, it does not question the system that produces the food crisis. <sep><sep> The Second International also suffered from severe criticisms when the First World War broke out, as different positions were taken on the imperialist war. <sep><sep> The MFPA points out: there is a great struggle between Chairman Bord and Director. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Navy has taken draconian actions against Rose Hill's small marsan. <sep><sep> Its government may be racist, but this is not the reason. <sep><sep> The issue revolves around recognizing differences between mental health problems resulting from Occupation and Miray, and other mental health problems unrelated to (mental disabilities from birth). <sep><sep> There is a new Irish TV movie on the Chagos issue in which many LALIT members played key roles. <sep><sep> We do not say that we have a magical formula against the crisis. <sep><sep> As a testimony in the present, the testimony becomes a symbol of the destruction and suffering of the Palestinian people today. <sep><sep> And there, they are suffering the terror of Israeli soldiers' arms. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He spoke Russian, French, English, and Spanish fluently. <sep> <sep> One day he came home to tell his mother that he was leaving home because he had just got married civilly to a girl. <sep> <sep> He has been appointed to a position in UNESCO, which is very important. <sep> <sep> If the State Zionist with Great Britain are going against the Pelindaba Treaty on Diego Garcia. <sep> <sep> The government is happy to publish an entire document of great historical importance: the first paper exam in Creole that the university has organized after a stay-along course called an introduction to Creole studies. <sep> <sep> Either way, they are committed (or even imprisoned) to plant in sugar cane production so that 4 clusters ensure enough cane for their refineries, they need bagasse and molasses. <sep> <sep> There were about 30 people present, most of them from Curepipe. <sep> <sep> It is certainly important to ask reflective questions: *Why haven't the representatives of the present organization criticized Bizlall's presence and actions, when their position could put him in front of his responsibilities? <sep> <sep> Always, the Government is resigning from his social responsibility in favor of a new unhealthy alliance between the Private Sector and NGOs. <sep> <sep> And when the bank seized the property, there was no new auction, so the bank ended up in bankruptcy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said that it may seem surprising that we start a debate before the debate-limem, but it's a way to allow our ideas to flow and the debate to take place. <sep><sep> Until we arrived at only the three entrances for A, B and Ch. <sep><sep> When you put all this together, you will find that what has made this strength that has made it possible for this bikini to cross. <sep><sep> (iii) History: The bourgeois ideology, because it is dominant, because reality today is capitalist reality, it makes us perceive "the economy" instead as something inevitable, even natural, whereas yes, it is a real dictator in the time of a small number of people. <sep><sep> What is important to realize is how this LALIT has organized 100 to 120 meetings that we are filming "For AN ALTERNATIVE ECONOMY" which served as the starting point for another 50-year-old meeting, 10 different tracks in 10,000 copies. <sep><sep> And we are seeing a stock market crisis, a crisis affecting banks in America, Europe, Asia, this crisis will affect the capital which is busy. <sep><sep> Rosemay told me, when she finds me shocked, how often that happens. <sep><sep> Even if 200 years later, when we speak there is a social life of about 100,000 bananas, and only 10,000 are essential in a society where there are different social classes. <sep><sep> At that time, in December, we met twice in public the publication of the Bunwaree Plan on education. <sep><sep> 11. The price of food production must be guaranteed for producers and fixed at the same time for those who buy it to eat; where necessary, the Government must subsidize or create a "stabilizing fund". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In our example, we find that wherever there is a formal reaction to a new idea. <sep> Rajesh Ramlogun; has filed a complaint against guard in the Nitin Chinien case. <sep> But, PT has a "democratization of the economy" agenda that is too strong for the bourgeoisie. <sep> Now I learn that in Planet-of-Sense, most people are like that. <sep> Meanwhile, his goal is to make Israel stop torturing Palestinian children in prison. <sep> In the 90s, what defined the strict labor movement were the years of capitalist globalization. <sep> (Members and sympathizers can contact the central committee for details.) <sep> When you go to Port Louis, it's the last time, you find an old man who has lost his way, asking "Where is the pension office?" <sep> Since the beginning of MMM, there has been a lot of turmoil that he has never managed to get rid of. <sep> There is a dispute in Enterprise Mauritius between Darga, the Chairman, and his manager. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It determines things like sickness, like how a sickness like the silicosis, will affect people working on a banana plantation, under what conditions will there be sickness? <sep><sep> Then they developed this "Al Dento" health program. <sep><sep> They told us that they visited 3 different universities. <sep><sep> And it make it seem like the strongest nation has to be the Swiss people, and no other country can be as strong. <sep><sep> In the era of Mrs. Thatcher, who was one of the most anti-union, anti-worker Prime Ministers, maybe Britain has never had. <sep><sep> In Congress, there will be an International Invite, with speakers from the LALIT leadership, most members and sympathizers of LALIT. <sep><sep> He also symbolizes the immense contrast between what appears to be true and the reality, and during the day, he strikes on the cover of the book. <sep><sep> And it is important to link our local, international, and regional struggles. <sep><sep> We already heard a radio presenter picking a fight on the air about a tooth pain in Bambous, saying that there are real problems! <sep><sep> There were ten family councils: four DSD, three government groups, and three opposition groups. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, the only point on which we can agree today is that it is an issue which urgently raises questions about the system responsible for this crisis - responsible for this crisis in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Secondly, the proximity alliance between employers and top management also affects the level of democracy and workers' freedom. <sep> <sep> We are still fighting for a care system that is suitable when a family is elderly, when a family has children. <sep> <sep> They will also speak about the importance of the mother tongue in education in a sustainable development framework. <sep> <sep> This capacity that everyone has to represent humanity is natural given the conditions in which they live among others. <sep> <sep> Often, the rain stopped in the film studios. <sep> <sep> There are 40 teams (20 multiple constituencies by 2 blocks): Lord ABC had to leave after counting a few less than 7 times. <sep> <sep> In our environment to do a good job, we need to make sure that nothing is pushed back. <sep> <sep> It could use its profits to grow its lamp by marriage and financial partnerships. <sep> <sep> Only where women are needed, there are about a hundred associations (750 each). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is merely a democratization that does not favor the common people, but rather favors a bourgeoisie seeking to rise, seeking economic space, be it in the energy production, tertiary education, the ICT sector, Tourism, Seafood Hub. <sep><sep> And, today when we talk about "work" and "alienation" in this discussion, we are talking about it in the context of a capitalist society. <sep><sep> Contradiction Question-Answer in Strategy Seminar 1 Meeting, Part I. <sep><sep> But, even the conscious trade union leaders acknowledge that this "unity" is very fragile. <sep><sep> Olivier Bancoult, Fernand Mandarin, and Linley Couronne also spoke yesterday. <sep><sep> They were languishing like miraculously, and meanwhile, they were nourishing growing crops and trees with natural fertilizers. <sep><sep> This file [showing a series of articles] was in one single newspaper, the Saturday Le Defi newspaper, where we find the promotion of a patronizing attitude. <sep><sep> The Creole language moves from oral to reading and writing; spelling is now a concern. <sep><sep> After independence, Ramgoolam's administration and, at times in coalition with Gaetan Duval, have promoted and continue a policy that maintains Mauritius' economy in the global capitalist system. <sep><sep> In Village and District Councils there have been only Bérenger and Jugnauth nominations since 2002. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Princess Prathna, Yosi and their eleven followers had left Kamomia before the sunrise to go to the land of Yapanama. <sep><sep> There is also this point that people are accustomed to saying, "When Mauritians go to another country, then they acknowledge their Mauritian identity, and they recognize another Mauritian as well!" <sep><sep> An organization called Conflict Awareness, led by a woman named Cathy Austin, for example, has said how 2 Russian military arsenals were setting up an airplane company here. <sep><sep> It's not a program like others have: in the present election, if we win, we will do a, b, c. <sep><sep> • Ensure that there are female candidates: alternative gender on the list of the party for Proportional Representation as supported by the Aimée system which is already being used where regional elections take place (which will bring about gender parity). <sep><sep> When LITRA is about to end, when the shareholders become bosses, then it discourages it, it enters into a special political fight. <sep><sep> and then it is, it reigns in the global interest of the bourgeoisie that finances it and controls it). <sep><sep> Thirdly, there are solar panels that fill a battery - for lighting, radio, television at home - that are already used in Mauritius to ensure certain hours of electricity during power outages. <sep><sep> There are approximately 500 thousand students in colleges and universities. <sep><sep> They decided to try to get a meeting with the President... <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The level of formality/informality that we choose to use is also known as "register". <sep><sep> On the other hand, the term "reveni" is used when giving land to pretend that there is "development". <sep><sep> Already, we are beginning to see a series of political crises that are shaking the Alliance MMM-MSM: if this Alliance is also weak today. <sep><sep> Only the police have the right to arrest or detain anyone for more than 3 days. <sep><sep> Those other 4 presidents, what will happen to them? <sep><sep> No to the new law in Israel criminalizing boycotts against colonies! <sep><sep> Finally, have you found the unions saying "When will we get our VRS, we use it too?" <sep><sep> The army uses these 2 means to prevent vehicle circulation and restrict pedestrian circulation not only at intersections but on long distances. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is another huge book by another writer (I forgot his name) who exactly captures what Foster had in mind at the beginning. <sep><sep> Many people have heard this interview on BBC World. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Love can sometimes create a spiral of dependence on Diego's power for only to fall into a trap and build more barriers between them. <sep><sep> When there is a major upheaval, it has allowed to change the system, and it is the workers themselves who have brought about this change. <sep><sep> -There is a type of conflict that provokes gratuitous violence and crime within families, between neighbors, in sexual competitions in a love triangle. <sep><sep> But this debate is taking place in a climate infected by communal and irresponsible language. <sep><sep> According to a resident of Riviere Cocos, in normal times they used to get water every 15 days, and now they are getting it every month. <sep><sep> The introduction of Creole language in schools is creating conditions to stop the trend of school children suffering because they are not being taught in their mother tongue. <sep><sep> Concerning the number of illiterate people in the world, and the way his father, who was illiterate, was bringing him and his brother to school every day. <sep><sep> He is the Minister of Finance, a shareholder of Med Point, and for Rs 144 million, he sold the clinic. <sep><sep> He has acknowledged LALIT for consistently showing support for the Palestinian cause, and not just paying lip-service but accompanying his words with actions. <sep><sep> Le Mauricien, April 11, 1996 - Leading role for Mauritius in drafting the Treaty. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are only 2 countries in Africa that have received this award. <sep><sep> Ultimately, politicians, religious leaders, have come together on the boat to discuss and have told us to give our home, be it Bwa Marsan, be it Rislye, be it wherever. <sep><sep> We notice that all government information, and all discussions of professionals on the radio about employment, are suggesting that work will be carried out through an operation (surgical work) which could be either by a cut (D & C) or by an aspiration form. <sep><sep> But, face to face, there are 8 Ministers who can be easily overthrown as their base in Workerist can regenerate, then there is the possibility of this new alliance with MMM. <sep><sep> For a long time, people were in need of work to live. <sep><sep> In the campaign, we are also finding ways in which MMM-MSM-PMSD are taking advantage of the state apparatus to carry out their campaign: <sep><sep> When separating an "extremely poor" section on the "Social Register" as Xavier Duval has done, it completely prevents the population from having a life amid the poverty affecting the working class in almost all sectors. <sep><sep> They are completely integrating the economy of inner Mauritius with the capitalist economy, which creates more inequality, economic crises, and is responsible for the ecological crisis. <sep><sep> Figure Aziza had changed, became a little sad for a few seconds. <sep><sep> Where is the rear-country of Jericho that climbs through the forest to the top of Montagn Pous - carved by the rain, weathered and afterwards, which represents the Jerichons, without them understanding much, their power and their natural instinct - which from within the clouds see people below on the plain and the beach with curiosity and compassion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He mentioned that the oil companies, the insurance companies, the nutrition companies were taking, controlling and guiding the economy and the social life of the country, leading other countries, having economic influence and social life is at risk in the country. <sep><sep> Until the debate that is taking place in Parliament and in the media on the irregularities that may have occurred in the tender allocation, the irregularities that should be responsible for the fact that the CNT is not doing well on the road: there are not many debates about the future of CNT, or about the plans that the government has for this corporation. <sep><sep> Another example is that when, in a country, there is development in the current system, where a factory is expanding its environmental footprint. <sep><sep> And in the context of this crisis, Xavier Duval Bidze, is not addressing the real problems. He has not drawn any lessons since the beginning of the global capitalist economy. <sep><sep> This program is meant to change what is happening in the country, and also to change the way decisions are made on what to produce. <sep><sep> We are aware that workers, like workers in all other sectors at this time where we live, are facing major attacks from employers and the government. <sep><sep> And with these 2 heads and 2 faces that allow it to contain these paradoxes that we have just discussed: <sep><sep> So his bidirectional measures are aimed at "changing" an economy that is in "crisis" or "stagnant", and redefining it as it was before. <sep><sep> Point Number Cath: More than two-thirds of Mauritians are in favor of introducing the mother tongue into formal and public domains. <sep><sep> It is a very simple, very clear word: we call it "Lepep". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A federation is not just about the tourist industry + casinos + municipalities. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, as the Mauritian State withdrew this historic motion, there are negotiations for an alliance between MSM and MMM. <sep><sep> And others in the unions, as well as licensed ones, have been working in the Government, it is like a Guardian of the school. <sep><sep> According to a UNESCO communique dated Tuesday, May 18, it states that the LPT has won this prize "for its work on showing adult literacy, especially among women, for its respect for cultural context and the use of the mother tongue." <sep><sep> When you look closely, why were the Chagossians deported in such harsh conditions, in such cruel conditions? <sep><sep> People say, "We would be very happy in a new world one day!" "What is necessary is to change people's mentality," like at the onset of a pandemic of "individual reform for everyone." <sep><sep> Now, some things have happened where we analyze the "crisis." <sep><sep> He forgot that VRS meant there will be no work for the upcoming generations. <sep><sep> It also mentions the statement by the former British Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bill Rammell, where he mentions a report (another discredited report). <sep><sep> At the time when he deposited his candidacy, the Electoral Commissioner, Mr. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before the elections, there were a lot of discussions about the female candidates. <sep><sep> Then this large rally was organized for the civilian population. <sep><sep> And now we can say that the issues around Diego Garcia and the Chagos are in a historical crossroads. <sep><sep> Because of this, they are still selling weapons to Sri Lanka. <sep><sep> with victims killed in Palestine where 1,100 people died. <sep><sep> Everyone laughed and said it's not funny that his father will fart during his daughter's wedding, it looks a lot like the same song when the occupation forces shoot bullets at Palestinians. <sep><sep> And we face difficulties because a comrade works shifts, so it's complicated. <sep><sep> Quite impressive how industrial complex with a mixed military presence inside controls all the people who are not fighting. <sep><sep> His screams were so loud, and the pain on his face was so profound that it did not seem to affect him. <sep><sep> Later I will learn what happened to me. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We can understand that Navin Ramgoolam wants to join forces with MSM and PMSD, but also with MMM. <sep>
<sep> A reflection to enable us to act correctly, to give us a vision for progress in theory and in practice to move from where people are today to where we want to be in the future.
<sep> In French and in English as well, the "people" at the time of Feudalism were called "serfs", which is a word derived from Latin "servus" meaning "slave".
<sep> In 2009, we also held a demonstration in front of Parliament to have our mother tongue recognized in Parliament, and we held 2 major seminars with around 20 organizations committed to a Forum for Indigenous Languages to safeguard the association's minutes.
<sep> When looking at politics and serious social crises, there is a glaring gap.
<sep> If you have gone, collect information from at least 5 different sources in villages to accurately determine what happened.
<sep> Planters' associations need to encourage planters who grow food, not just planters who grow sugar cane.
<sep> Hopefully, we may be able to explain the small waves that the current political crisis is creating in a single direction.
<sep> It is said that we should stop what we call 'growth' in our society, we should go beyond sustainable development and move away from the concept of development.
<sep> The hope for this family in injustice, in a free Palestine from occupying forces, where there will be no more losses, it would have been difficult to believe if I hadn’t been there, experiencing this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Dharam Raj, who found the situation dangerous, called the Prime Minister to inform him that he was not aware. <sep><sep> Diego Garcia has the potential to employ Mauritian labor and a market for Mauritian products. <sep><sep> We have to fight against this kind of technocrat. <sep><sep> What does a political party, more upper classes, all come together in one unified point. <sep><sep> Only in 1950 with the Agricultural Revolution and when collectivizing the land in whole Lasinn that compromise broke. <sep><sep> There are ministers who are bringing the fight for their political service on allegations of wounds and blows. <sep><sep> This means the compensation money that Europe is giving to ACP countries like Mauritius, when it dismantles its preferential system for former colonies, its "accompaniment" is going into this kind of development. <sep><sep> And with this confusion, it's a very serious problem. <sep><sep> Because of this, parallel to literature, a literary current was developing. <sep><sep> They hid their anger against their oppressors and were getting a place thanks to a small movement of their lips. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Timi had caught his lame cousin and told him: " All this time you were my enemy and I didn't know it, I'm Sunday." <sep> <sep> The first people to suffer when there is a policy targeting, are very old people. <sep> <sep> But he had announced that he was resigning from the Central Committee. <sep> <sep> This year, the Government has decided to subsidize freight so that rice, wheat, flour and sugar are sold at the same price as in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Without much effort, without major problems, he went through the first, reached the second, then the senior grade 2, got admitted to the Training to learn the profession of primary school teacher, got his certificate and started working. <sep> <sep> Bérenger has confiscated the St Felix beach from the public, fenced it off, to give it to the owner of the hotel. <sep> <sep> 10 years later, there was another example, the same thing, in City Knitwear Kirpip, in 1987 where 20-odd employees, like themselves, began to collapse. <sep> <sep> And it is terribly important to understand this because MMM has never been as open-hearted as it used to be, keeping the state power, so it has not been able to develop itself into a state bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> Since we brought our campaign, we have seen several gains. <sep> <sep> So the Government called this "flexibility of labour", the unions called it the "hire and fire" law meaning to recruit and fire as a right for employers, while before job security was a worker's right. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, quick solutions are needed to close the wide welfare gap as this will give an advantage to certain service providers. <sep><sep> For example, everyone knows in Mauritius that there is a place called Anna. <sep><sep> But, today it is making a strong effort to introduce Creole language in schools. <sep><sep> The prison guard is working on behalf of everyone when looking after prisoners. <sep><sep> And, the seminar aims to bring together traditional knowledge of crops and livestock on one side, and scientific agriculture on the other. <sep><sep> Families who needed to have tools to engage in activities all the time, who couldn't go to clubs or bars to forget their troubles, were starting to look for a way out not just for themselves but for their spouses, children, families, and neighbors. <sep><sep> So, whether it's the program level or the team level, there is no difference between the two Alliances. <sep><sep> Because just because people who read newspapers don't know Ramesh Khaytoo doesn't mean his contribution isn't part of the collective memory. <sep><sep> He was always discreet and took advantage of every opportunity he had not to stand in the way. <sep><sep> The story of class struggle, i.e. having a conversation in a narrative form about class struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the year 2000, the Israeli army has been detaining more than 8,000 Palestinian children in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which is about 700 per year. <sep><sep> If Ashok Subron wanted to create a career as a technocrat trade unionist, he was free to do so without bringing this kind of trouble and without sacrificing so much as a young person and as a militant. <sep><sep> In Cuba, we have an example that shows nationalism that guards its anti-imperialist elements. <sep><sep> For example, there was an expert who said that in a small country there should be one variety of produce planted that would be easy to sell in the global market. <sep><sep> Ganga wanted to use champagne but Devi did not drink alcohol. <sep><sep> Normally people from the countryside, where there's an understanding that some people have a "stable" diet, which means eating what they eat every day. <sep><sep> One day, as he approached a crossroads, from afar he felt a presence but he did not find anything because the sign was broken and all the flowers were wilting. <sep><sep> He established an analysis on the fact that Mauritius is entering what we call a "systemic crisis", or as Gramsci called it, an "organic crisis". <sep><sep> It's the third meeting on this subject in this neighborhood. <sep><sep> We will give our internationalism some political content, and we will make it part of our daily work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The problem with abstract and universal ideas is that, due to their characteristics, they guide us without us realizing it. <sep> <sep> This conference has sparked controversy with Democracy Watch, which has defended nationalism as a bourgeois ideology. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin has stated that Navin Ramgoolam has a "zig-zag strategy" concerning his potential partners for a pre-electoral alliance. <sep> <sep> However, we are in the midst of a severe crisis in the financial capital that is threatening global economic recession and the US dollar is declining. <sep> <sep> So, we need to adapt to this new development, the fact that money leaves the country more than it enters, especially in times of crisis. <sep> <sep> They seem to be waging a war, they have realized, against their comrades, not against their bosses. <sep> <sep> The priority is to develop a political program, on which workers today will fight together. <sep> <sep> It is in Washington, we are not voting for it, and we do not find it too reliable. <sep> <sep> And we need to visit them: LALIT has 2 main focuses: Israel-Palestine and the base on Diego Garcia. <sep> <sep> Civil wars occur in the most extreme cases in other countries, while imperialist bombings and invasions happen in some others. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The third thing that plays a role in a political organization, and we are looking at it in the context of a program, is the quality of the service that the LALIT militant gives in the workers' organizations. <sep>  It may have no work, scrapping for an end, in extreme poverty. <sep> If the public is not satisfied with the way the press has acted, the only recourse there is to go to the police (if there is an article against criminal law) or to take legal action for damages in the case of defamation. <sep> Isn't it time to transform the Mauritius Sugar Authority into an Optimal Land Utilisation Authority? <sep> Interestingly, this year, it is also a special celebration as UNESCO has chosen its theme for 2012 precisely this issue: 'Education in the mother tongue, inclusive education'. <sep> This is for a very simple reason: they form part of the machinery of the state, and this in a very precise sense: they participate in the mechanism of regulating "worker exploitation," as Alain Ah-Vee explained in his speech. <sep> In my speech, I am proposing to look at a small thing: new developments that have developed on a global level that affect us here. <sep> People will say, "If he died, man, he has finished dying, finished, he will not be able to leave us in difficulty." <sep> Speculation in the IRS is boosting foreign investment, as it seems there is real development and the creation of stable jobs. <sep> However, a plan for electricity production and consumption is needed in line with the economic development model. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is necessary to lower your expectations to a low 6% in order for those who start working to get a job. <sep><sep> So, I had to start a little further away to understand this also in Marxist terms. <sep><sep> However, there are diversions on compensation, on ERA, and when there are primary diversions, Subron is even closer to a safer approach. <sep><sep> An "outpost" is a two-container with wheels slightly like a caravan that is like an appendix to a colony that has already been established. <sep><sep> Or "We need to use European money to create jobs without destroying jobs", not just accept VRS and Blueprint. <sep><sep> We have to force our government here, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will also change this balance of forces, so that we can be on this "high moral ground". <sep><sep> It is because they created this confusion to make the FPU headquarters, it is a political base for Bizlall. <sep><sep> For the first time in history, the location is being presented to reclaim land ownership in the country. <sep><sep> Shyama Ramgoolam-Soondur used to work with the private sector, but only after his enemies became a pro-private sector journalist. <sep><sep> What we need today is a mobilization of rights to launch a movement whose goal is to allow workers and poor people to face the crisis together, where we take our destiny in our hands. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Given the strict control by the union officials and other factors affecting union movement and other working-class organizations, what steps can we take to safeguard against possible infiltration in the way that working-class organizations could organize? <sep> <sep> And when studying this translation report by Dr. Ramstein, it is fraught with errors, important omissions, and especially misinterpretations of what Dr. Ramstein actually said. <sep> <sep> If we take the example of the VRS where we find, for instance, that the majority of workers want to take VRS, what it means is the right to a revolutionary or even a workers' class battle will move closer to the minority among the workers in the security industry. <sep> <sep> The Committee for Human Rights of Zionists says that this obligation represents a violation of a section of the convention signed by Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Rabbis for Human Rights, an organization based in Jerusalem, just called to say that the Army did not allow them to accompany the Palestinians to pick olives. <sep> <sep> We have developed 4 central demands on which we will mobilize: <sep> <sep> more transparency for the reconstruction of the country where infrastructure has been bombed. <sep> <sep> Even though it just allows for 2 Alliances which have been proven to have committed electoral fraud in elections. <sep> <sep> At that time, the bosses say they'll go home. <sep> <sep> But for the last 3 months, from October onwards, and while Ramgoolam has been absent from the country for long periods for reasons not too clear or known. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The electoral tactics are not different from those of the two coalitions but rather a parody of them. <sep><sep> In the textile sector, workers are often forced to work overtime and even asked to do so because the pay is too low. <sep><sep> The National Assembly is a moment where members vote in detail on all aspects of the party in a single moment. <sep><sep> So, whether it's in the security industry, textile, or hotels, the employer must be able to do so according to the new law. <sep><sep> And all of this is in spite of its background. <sep><sep> We have not been able to build enough political pressure to force the government to abolish communalism in politics. <sep><sep> Workers here have organized themselves to work as a collective rather than an individual. <sep><sep> In England, class consciousness had made great strides before the Thatcher era. <sep><sep> With Kamini and Sami at the helm, he managed to get in touch with Dharam Raj, and gradually, a current between the two men began to flow. <sep><sep> Will pension laws be amended so that all four women are entitled to a widows' pension? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He did not have grand plans filled with ambition, tension, and stress. <sep><sep> Today, we see people like Cyril Monty, Professor Juggesur, even Amedee Darga, in a certain way, reasoning in a manner that shows their minds are not strictly in a textile and cane mentality. <sep><sep> Revelation (which is also a call for peace but which the rest of the book is on negative feelings (fear, guilt, doubt), on the indoctrination of children under strain. <sep><sep> On the occasion of World Creole Language Day, Saturday, October 29th, LPT will be launching, for the first time in Mauritius, an interactive electronic dictionary. <sep><sep> We know the historical reasons why it is like this - long ago, prior to 1947, there was a community called "Indo-Mauritian", then it was necessary to break this into 2, after Partition in India in 1947. <sep><sep> As usual, the Political Bureau will act on a rotational basis. <sep><sep> The first challenge is as we found here in Mauritius, it reduces the actual salary of workers. <sep><sep> At the time when Ramgolam started using MSM as 'loyal opposition'. <sep><sep> The evasion of a drug trafficking network by a single police code reappeared in Saint Gilles les Hauts, La Reunion, where the Reunion gendarmerie arrested the Mauritian drug trafficker with a large quantity of drugs. <sep><sep> He says to the union, if you want a collective agreement, don't look at us, go to the employer. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>He continued until finally deciding to revoke the strike in the security industry. <sep> <sep> The first important point is when the leader of the opposition leaves everyone in prison, he's doing it in the name of everyone in society. <sep> <sep> Elaborate an action plan to integrate new mothers and sympathizers, on issues such as: <sep> <sep> Students are taking Creole language classes in primary schools this year. <sep> <sep> After the first wave in 2008 (meaning 2007-9, more precisely), some analysts were already predicting a "double dip" or a "W", meaning a reappearance of a recovery after the first crisis, but a recovery that did not last. <sep> <sep> What are you demanding, why are you demanding it, and where these demands will lead us to real solutions to the crises. <sep> <sep>He breaks the title into three parts “what is a citizen”, “what is the law”, and then goes on to look into the relationship. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin says he is surprised that no one, except Lalit, has noticed this. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen, in 5-Plus, will comment on the way progressive sanctions for women in the past 25 years have been made despite MMM. <sep> <sep> Whether it's in Medine, whether in Lestin, or in Bel Ombre, or in Union, they are all involved. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> Let me provide you with the translation keeping the <sep> tags in the correct place:
<sep> Although expenses were increasing, especially when Tamby and Samy were a year ahead of finishing primary school to go to college, they could cope. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen on behalf of Lalit, wrote a "Let Uver a Sitwayen Britanik and Amerikin" (see page 224). <sep><sep> In the Transport industry, unions were demanding an increase in salary and better working conditions and when they finally took legal action, their lawsuits were sometimes related to certain issues that may resolve at the NRB. <sep><sep> In terms of primary politics, today it is Pravind Jugnauth who leads the MSM and he has his own ambitions. <sep><sep> A long time ago, in ancient times, during the Roman Empire period. The world was divided into two groups. <sep><sep> This licensing issue is an unacceptable interference with freedom of expression and freedom of association of unions in Mauritius Telecom, which may even be unconstitutional. <sep><sep> Also, in the Seegobin family, when he was 20, he used to work as a carpenter before becoming an adored family member by all children, children who are now over 70 years old. <sep><sep> As a political activist, we know the demands we bring here, it is in the minority today. <sep><sep> And then, the last time there was a scandal about the nomination of PSC members. <sep><sep> It was recognized that there is a new interest among the working class to understand these crises. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He says that alienation is the outcome of the capitalist production process. <sep><sep> They have a certain editorial control also over the content at other times/space outside advertising limem. <sep><sep> There are other issues too: Navin Ramgoolam says 'Best loser is a good thing!' <sep><sep> Because the US and Britain are still illegally occupying the Chagos archipelago. <sep><sep> Immediately, when the distress signal arrived, SILU decided to withdraw its case from the IRC. <sep><sep> Anti-occupation activists (Israeli and Palestinian) are blocking Route 443 in the city of Be'lin, Ramallah. <sep><sep> They have reduced the number of MPs in Parliament with the resignations of Ashok Jugnauth, Shekar Naidu, and Joe Lesjongard. <sep><sep> The La Zante shipping company is marketing Chagos as a crazy cruise destination from Seychelles. <sep><sep> So, there, we will continue our work on the deepening food crisis. <sep><sep> Besides that, it's a well-known fact that many people have multiple identities on Facebook; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin has concluded by saying that he has chosen to present our history in a way that shows how LALIT has gone through these 30 years. <sep><sep> It's a bit of a difficult task to determine what has been exceeded, what needs to disappear. <sep><sep> We say, "It's a beautiful work!" This painting, this drawing, we call it a "work", but in fact it is a productive work. <sep><sep> However, bourgeois ideology prevents us from understanding this kind of decision, this kind of collective reflection. <sep><sep> Now, on November 14 supposedly there will be a General Assembly of St Felix shareholders to confirm the Board's decision. <sep><sep> So, we read about the struggles and revolutions in other countries, and we understand how they have succeeded. <sep><sep> so that we can contribute to a community program to implement a strategy and work towards a more equitable society, we need to have a large number of working class people with an advanced political consciousness. <sep><sep> On his shoulder, there was a beautiful little blue bird with a golden beak on his head. <sep><sep> That night, on the way back home, the parents were more attentive to their son, but he had gone deaf. <sep><sep> Hence there's no clear way to not be able to achieve real reparations that are urgently needed based on humane reasons, while the ETERNAL ISLAND SIZE, through the stories of CITIZENS of this BIOT fiction. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are factors concerning the economy and sanctions in the natural work environment. <sep><sep> Many resignations are taking place in the UT, once again, we hear that Ashok Subron has achieved ILO. <sep><sep> When we have seen theories by Friedman, Hayek, applied by Thatcher, Reagan all of that, has become part of the bourgeois world's process to start developing a political process for nature, it is more seen as a conflict with employers, certainly. <sep><sep> We have also refused to sign a petition to Obama that we found incomplete. <sep><sep> “The American government should not fear transferring sovereignty of the Chagos to Mauritius.” <sep><sep> The committee organized by Parwas St Antoine was a great success. <sep><sep> Resistance against this occupation and colonization has never stopped. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin has said that a kind of "front against criminality" is being created, where Resistance and Alternatif are taking on a challenge not so much against the best loser system, but against the fact that each candidate must be classified for nature, which is not even the issue. <sep><sep> There will be a chance for the public to pose questions or give their opinions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The 3rd Cyber Tower cannot solve this problem. <sep><sep> But, in the meantime, when the boss security guard faces economic problems in the past, he started selling marginal land, for people to plant sugar cane for his mill. <sep><sep> But comrade, Neville Alexander is coming from South Africa. <sep><sep> They are more interested in who will be the Prime Minister, who will be the President, what alliances to make for electoral victory – without any analysis or program. <sep><sep> We have had an economic policy that burdened the working class with all the weight of the series of crises we have had. <sep><sep> If MSPA negotiates, let Abe Medina say "I'm not involved, me". <sep><sep> The invisible ceiling that was blocking the promotion of Madam Ganga Bolema was broken when she had a million-dollar contract, finally assuming the position of General Manager and President of the board. <sep><sep> Except that it doesn't specify whether it's saying this for certain that they don't want to declare a community or if it's for no one to fill out because there are no questions on the Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> But, in the meantime, BAI and more of Ramgoolam are looking where La Reunion is. <sep><sep> People used to live collectively, in groups, and make decisions together on how they would organize themselves in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And when MMM comes to power, because he represents all classes, he finds himself in the role representing the strongest, and ends up representing the oligarchic bourgeoisie, the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> But the article makes us make some other observations. <sep><sep> When things settle down, the Minister may go, come on, but the Civil Service, it, it remains. <sep><sep> All these parties, most of the parties outside parliament, agree on reform, it is difficult to find. <sep><sep> Where can you choose Form 6 colleges that are not in the region? <sep><sep> The college professor union, UPSEE, also supported us on these 2 points. <sep><sep> Where is the government telling these people to go work? <sep><sep> I'm thinking of Jerry Cadine, a skilled worker and member of LALIT, Cehl Meeah, a professor and leader of a political party, Martine Desmarais, a professor, Bala Soobarayem. <sep><sep> If you don't light the rear light, stop it, you're in violation. <sep><sep> Even sitting on the pavement is no longer possible due to occupation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>He used his family's reflexes not to take a dessert if he is full, which shows the permanent liberty that family has because he doesn't feel insecure to move freely. <sep> An economic crisis, and a social crisis in many families. <sep> He has managed to make two strikes with the union supporting him, and he is trying again. <sep> So, we need to advise, direct, convince, and in his interest, and in the national interest. <sep> He can train the country in all kinds of communal languages and in cases of conflict, bringing dynamics that train the country towards a Lebanization. <sep> On September 23, 1979, there was a signature "Lakor 23 Ut", which signifies the victory of the largest degrowth movement in Mauritian history. <sep> So that everyone can eat as they need, there are laws that need to be and a suitable job, with dignity? <sep> And for this reason, we find the LALIT level to be useless or to treat the symptoms, or heal the things that are happening because of a more serious matter. <sep> To all "language activists" who have worked politically and continue to work politically against the remaining colonial mentality that is still keeping our mother tongue oppressed, language activists who have worked and continue to work for the advancement of Creole and Bhojpuri languages; <sep> We need to know that there are other ways to do politics. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is an IFM, a Cultural Health Centre, and an Amnesty. <sep><sep> Regarding the exam fee, the government wants to provide subsidies only to children who can prove that their parents earn no more than Rs 30,000 per month. <sep><sep> Furthermore, when the Trade Union Trust Fund started giving money to union movements on a "federation" level, several unions created new "federations" just to receive funding twice. <sep><sep> Today in L'Express, in an interview, he ends his interview by saying: "If certain individuals have interesting alternatives, all businessmen and citizens would be willing to listen". <sep><sep> No more cutting corners in debates! After the election where the Timi team got a small advantage, it became clear to political observers that a new dynamic had taken shape and the arguments were stronger in regions like Grangob-Bonnvenn. <sep><sep> You say we are not like that dictator, where we have the right to vote, sir. <sep><sep> The old production system takes a bit of time to erase what explains the continuity of the old ideology. <sep><sep> So, when promoting mother tongues, you are giving a powerful tool to the oppressed people in classrooms. <sep><sep> Mario Flore admits he is financed by Thierry Lagesse. <sep><sep> Therefore, the worker's movements have determined his actions, like a human being. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This political program is composed of 3 layers, which are interconnected and together distinguish it clearly from pro-bourgeois political parties or from populist civil society movements: <sep><sep> LALIT is already a member of the international No Bases network that militates against military bases. <sep><sep> There was a speech by the Minister of Agriculture in February, and just before that, the Prime Minister's speech on Independence, where he noted the seriousness of the food crisis. <sep><sep> Workers and unions have organized demonstrations to denounce the Sithanen Budget because it started austerities. <sep><sep> While this "poznan theory" appears in capitalist logic towards a monopolistic system, American capitalism has continued its relative strengthening compared to various European states, which are now facing it unitedly. <sep><sep> Outside support is needed from the Palestinians, Israelis, and people around the world to find a sustainable solution in Palestine and Israel. <sep><sep> Activities by MPs and the Socialist Party in the field of land rights, through press conferences, private conferences, speeches in various inaugurations, recent statements. <sep><sep> Unions were formed in a sector, workers came together, they wrote their constitution and their regulations, and then the union had to register. <sep><sep> 'Now, it will force the government to pass laws to consolidate Endo-Kreol power and at the same time create tensions among different ethnic groups.' - 'How can MPs like Ayoun do nothing to prevent this?' - 'You'll find Fatma, long ago I thought the Prime Minister was against all this but his hand under the rose. <sep><sep> A question and answer session followed testimonies from Alain Ah-Vee and Kisna Kistnasamy. <batch_sep><batch_sep> When Zheng descended from the airplane, he took off his shirt to show his friends the bruises on his body and wounds. When the guards spotted him, they took him and returned him to his cell. <sep> <sep> If the private sector cannot create jobs, the government must create jobs. <sep> <sep> All the leaders of the social democratic party, they appeal to people's love for socialist ideas. <sep> <sep> Since the attacks by the USA in Pakistan by drone strike, leading to protests and demonstrations every week in Lasinn, where there have been millions of layoffs due to the crisis. <sep> <sep> The LALIT campaign for an alternative economic policy has entered a new phase. <sep> <sep> 86% of people in the private sector, companies – big and small. <sep> <sep> (Yesterday, PT did not manage to end its mandate together with MSM in the government. <sep> <sep> Mauritians, islanders who were born here, need to be able to leave. <sep> <sep> The high cost of travel makes it difficult for many to enjoy Jazz and dancing nights out; Rs 600 per person for the best spot. <sep> <sep> In the police force, there is a problem with Inspector Tuyau's initiative to promote police rights by forming a union. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a context where we are witnessing a surge of bad behavior within Parliament and in the Opposition, we are seeing a mobilization without any reflection leading up to the 1st of May. <sep> But it is consolidating itself along with another party, MSM, a party that almost doesn't exist without power. <sep> Hard work, beating about, in construction, inflating trucks, when there is work, or work, or the family eats, when there is no work, or no work, or the family does not eat. <sep> A present woman, Suzana Mukobwajana, recently won a prize for her book in the Rwandan language. <sep> But, what is even more serious, is the security industry in crisis. <sep> we were saying, at the time, that regardless of which side in these 2 political blocks, whether it is the Social Alliance, whether it is the MSM-MMM Alliance, regardless of which forms the next government after elections, there will be an ultra-liberal economic policy. <sep> But this distribution chain, who will determine how much planting distance is needed and how much resin is needed? It is a permanent conflict. <sep> This blockade has led to a real economic catastrophe in Gaza. <sep> After Ram Seegobin finished presenting his paper, there was a long debate, with many new propositions about both party construction and recruitment. <sep> The Aamer family has been living as if in a virtual prison for 2 years: their house is surrounded on 3 sides by military fences and an Israeli colony. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Trade in Services, if there is foreign investment, then the government does not have the right to offer subsidies only to its "national" university. <sep><sep> If there is no political organization like LALIT, a socialist challenge to the capitalist system would make perfect sense. <sep><sep> Because large laboratories etc. have faced problems, they themselves, because of insufficient regulation. <sep><sep> or the textile industry restructuring plan, an industry that does not have much future for Mauritius. <sep><sep> It is a system that changes the nature of every election. <sep><sep> This means that when we combine these two processes, for the first time the mother tongue of the majority of Mauritians is officially recognized, it has taken its place among the other languages taught in schools. <sep><sep> When the MMM seeks power, therefore, it seeks to form an alliance, it seeks to make the working class form an alliance with the state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> An SILU-UASI branch has been set up for Medina that meets every week, looks at worker problems, looks at what is happening in the country, looks at ways to mobilize. <sep><sep> " Ziz Seetulsing demands that the government come up with an amendment: "We understand that a project of electoral reform is on the cards, and hope that these defects would be remedied in the near future". <sep><sep> It is controlled by a new clear system: it does not control you by religious ideology, it does not control you only by monopolizing land, but it controls you by buying a part of your life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Intervene only when necessary and useful, not out of desire or partiality. <sep><sep> Reza Issack has also resigned as PPS and Maurice Allet as president of the MPA. <sep><sep> Till today, neither you nor your predecessor have dealt with this issue with the seriousness it requires. <sep><sep> The State has the backing of finances for young entrepreneurs in doubt: first, to mitigate the shock that globalization is bringing through offering cheap labor. <sep><sep> Nazim Esoof had long phone conversations with Ram Seegobin every time he had a dossier to prepare, to help him get a framework. <sep><sep> In July 2013, it was supposed to be the last negotiation for MSPA. <sep><sep> The law should not allow employers to simply "hire and fire", to only take on people and dismiss them under conditions that the employer desires. <sep><sep> Israel's fear policy against the Palestinian people has heightened in the last 3 weeks. <sep><sep> UNESCO itself states that the mother tongue should be used in education. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, revolutionaries are negotiating their freedom through a reshaping of ideas and cultural diversity far from the bourgeois and ruling class, old and new. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The fraud was discovered when it was in the MMM-MSM coalition government. <sep><sep> This struggle was part of a battle to organize the working class, but also to develop an ideology that is in the interest of the working class in general. <sep><sep> Here's what he said in his speech: <sep><sep> When money has become a symbol of power and represents all social powers, there is something that happens: production is supposed to serve the necessities, but only serves production. <sep><sep> "We are running candidates in all the constituencies in Mauritius," Alain announced, "and in some constituencies, we are running more than one candidate." <sep><sep> He announced that many organizations have expressed their support for Lalit, Alain Ah-Vee, and Lamars Laliberte. <sep><sep> If you go to Australia, France, England, America, wherever you go, Africa, India, Pakistan, wherever, the political parties as we are facing the same problem. <sep><sep> - The Social Charter in all countries of the world speaks of these agreements on misery, poverty, social inequality. <sep><sep> We talk a lot about trade unions, and especially about work in the army and in hotels, giving members in precarious sectors. <sep><sep> In the village of Bambous, many families that find themselves in difficulty, for example lack of food, we found that Ramesh and his wife Pulo have a sack of rice, and have curry to share. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is important for everyone to have rights under the law. <sep><sep> We need to highlight that this law is in conflict with the Convention on Biological Diversity, called the 'FAO Concept of Farmers' Rights'. <sep><sep> in order for her to get a good job, even if life is hard, don't do anything, she will have get her Rs 20,000, Rs 30,000, Rs 50,000 per month because she has a good certificate, has a good place. <sep><sep> So through these 20 years of neoliberal banana, it has consolidated a lot. <sep><sep> At night, she serves labuzi and has to go to where the residents who have been regularized. <sep><sep> These people have a long history, a civilization millennia before the tanks and bazookas Samazeste Toupoumwa and Lord Toutouk Touni came to plant their flags. <sep><sep> MMM's historic tragedy is that he was too strong, too harsh. <sep><sep> And for them to become our allies, we need to inform them about their government's dominance. <sep><sep> - Tertiary Education - In this sector, it seems (through the Jeetah lampir and the Jeetah Minister) to be building a new "Historical Business Education Block". <sep><sep> For example, it had already brought a text to claim Kamomi Health. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, the State has recognized our maternal language as a language. <sep><sep> Economic demands made by the bourgeoisie, lead toward a serious economic crisis.  <sep><sep> Let us meet to create conditions for peace in the world. <sep><sep> In the past, there has been a pursuit for violation of the rule and "molesting police" against Georges Legallant and Veena Dholah. <sep><sep> The Second International of the Year 1889 was born in Paris. <sep><sep> Presently all students benefit from a 50% grant in respect of examination fees, irrespective of the income level of their parents. <sep><sep> So, when someone finds out that in America, this individual who has borrowed money and is unable to repay it, then the Bank seizes the property. <sep><sep> Once it emerges, in that era, it begins to take form as a unit, a "nation", nations that do not have a state, states which then create a "nation". <sep><sep> When Navin Ramgoolam took office again in 2005, the situation was very different because what has happened is the neoliberal policies applied since the 1980s have strengthened the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Each time, if you notice it well, this British attitude we denounce in every forum. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They went on the same platform with those parties. <sep><sep> Friend Patrick: I will come with what Reeaz said before, and what he recently said, and he went in the same direction. <sep><sep> The power of his dream could appear as an ambition to show what he can do, to take revenge on the life that made him suffer many imitations. <sep><sep> Mauritian politicians have not come to realize the conditions of life here. <sep><sep> We know there is a small francophone group against the Mauritian Creole language (but certainly not all those who are pro-French are anti-Mauritian Creole), and they are also anti-Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> He has started his investigation into a book to answer. <sep><sep> We have chosen the landmarks where we have distributed the first leaflet, where people are accustomed to going to bed at this time since 1977-78, and even before. <sep><sep> Bérenger has given permission for the private sector to build 6 -storie buildings, a location, and to cement the best agricultural land in Mauritius. On the other hand. <sep><sep> If you were to give someone your true value, what you are worth, there would be no misery for anyone. <sep><sep> We have conversations to claim our rights, which belong to us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Normally, a political party cannot use the term "nation" to rally, as the nation is divided by social classes. <sep><sep> Last time, the UK traded a piece of land to the US at half price of its value, Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said he is against the government. <sep><sep> Therefore, the Mauritian Government has been complicit with the presence of the base. <sep><sep> And like my presidency, each session in this International Conference, we will have another member of LALIT to preside. <sep><sep> So for this 3-week campaign, we need to carefully canvass by going door-to-door in each constituency by inviting people one by one. <sep><sep> Yesterday, the District Court building was filled with platform supporters against Bush. <sep><sep> There is already a debate on this issue, with importers sabotaging when the Minister set a fixed markup. <sep><sep> It was betrayed by the Alliance for the Future for several reasons. <sep><sep> As we say, the struggle, we are still bringing the struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to Shabak, the secret service of Israel, R. has not been arrested but is only under interrogation by the secret police. <sep><sep> As everyone knows, the UNESCO language policy is to "use the mother tongue of children" in the education system. <sep><sep> It is a very reasonable proposal, and LALIT has already publicly proposed it for a long time. <sep><sep> It is essential, however, for workers to avoid undermining the credibility of the two new labor laws, the Employment Relations Act and the Employment Rights Act, which are responsible for further weakening the working class. <sep><sep> So, when he joined the Lalit de Klas as a founder in 1976, he brought that experience, that knowledge, that incredible wisdom to our party. <sep><sep> However, these preferential trade terms are becoming especially challenging since the World Trade Organization (WTO) started in 1994-1995. <sep><sep> It was sponsored by a think tank called the "Trilateral Commission," which included a CEO, a banker, a university professor, a delegate from a major law firm, etc. <sep><sep> Then Ram explains how we write, type on a typewriter, and make photocopies. <sep><sep> The Workers' Education has announced the launch of its 5th Literary Contest. <sep><sep> Either it must be reformed drastically, or another system must be sought. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT, we never thought he represented that alternative. He was never the alternative we were looking for. <sep><sep> For this reason, Reza Uteem took a position not like his leader, unlike Shakeel who was eating bananas in two goals. <sep><sep> He invited them all to follow him in a burning car. <sep><sep> Yesterday they were becoming great capitalists. Where, in the press, great sermons cannot be expected. <sep><sep> Control of electricity on the island, and control of deputies on the ministers, and on the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> There was a conflict between Bizlall and Berenger, everyone knows that. <sep><sep> In the same signal, the police arrested 3 LALIT militants and detained them at Rose Belle station because they were handcuffing the Platform police. <sep><sep> This international campaign has had many successes: John Pilger produced a documentary "Stealing a Nation" that made everyone aware of Diego Garcia and Chagos. <sep><sep> Especially after Ashok Subron, the main ally in GWF, Farouk Auchaybar, sold out, especially after the leaders of the FPU and the lepers' union made physical violence threats against him. <sep><sep> Just like from the 1970s until the 1990s, one after the other, there were severe crises affecting all countries throughout the Earth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He has become a stranger to everyone around him. <sep><sep> The tourism industry, which was supposed to diversify, is in a crisis like never before. <sep><sep> It was a price that all prisoners paid, but then, the last time the state had to face a challenge. <sep><sep> * On an international level, we held Tony Blair accountable on the Chagos issue. <sep><sep> Furthermore, he gained a reputation as a woman who made men tremble, and Gangadhar was pleased with that role. <sep><sep> Its price is fixed in a society where everything is already priced. <sep><sep> Whether it's 4, 17, 4, 3 May, to make these patterns in the sweater. <sep><sep> Launching these structures, it forms the basis of our "media". <sep><sep> In the last 20 years, it is the identity of the former Prime Minister that has dominated the discussion before every election, not even the program of his party or Alliance: <sep><sep> We also invite you to read and have your friends visit news and documents and Art Form and we also have links to other local and international organizations that you can find with just a click. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There can be a gathering like the one on Wall Street today, in 100 American cities, questioning this financial capital domination. <sep><sep> In other sectors, like gasoline, licensing is starting. <sep><sep> A third member of LALIT joked that he didn't seem bothered that he lost his wallet, and he didn't even mention it. <sep><sep> Similarly, when the government increases income tax, introduces VAT, it also brings problems. <sep><sep> In school, we were managing but soon lost focus. <sep><sep> So when they started working to find more people to resign from Lalit, what they were doing was asking people to stop fighting. <sep><sep> But workers don't get a big enough share in capitalist production to buy a house in current conditions. <sep><sep> He said we are not saying it's "good" or "bad" to criticize, but it's a fact. <sep><sep> We took action where LALIT submitted a major dossier of hundreds of pages to the Minister of Finance Sithanen. <sep><sep> - It's not a "true minutes" when he changes it after being read out to Register in another book, and then reads minutes in the next meeting in a foreign language, before approval and signing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This evening the television broadcasted a major report on work in parliament. <sep><sep> The first part, was in a context of economic crisis: the price of basic necessities is increasing, textile market protection is decreasing, and the price of petrol is rising. <sep><sep> The link here is clear when one understands the class politics. <sep><sep> Because the negotiations for the alliance agreements have started. <sep><sep> Even a new constitution has been put forward by an organization that self-destructed in March. <sep><sep> In terms of politics, we have been in government since the General Elections in May 2010, the Alliance PT-MSM-PMSD. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee and Cindy Clelie, two members of Lalit, accompanied him to submit the candidacies, as witnesses. <sep><sep> It is not clear whether he is a Minister for the PMSD or for the workers. <sep><sep> Today, many people believe that there was a middle class, a poor class in 1985 with the Marshal Plan, and today there are the "extremely poor". <sep><sep> A special invitation has been launched to the unemployed, associations, teachers and students. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Get all the people who come from Seychelles, Zilwa and Mauritius together in the Langar. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, as the death toll of 2,000 soldiers in Iraq, a scandal erupted over Dick Cheney's advisor, Lewis Libby, for the false reasons to invade Iraq. <sep><sep> Finance Minister Sithanen, in his place, without any law, pleads with the newspapers for bosses to let go of some foreign exchange, Kisna Kistnasamy said. <sep><sep> like MEDYOM, representing the language (the environment majority of our Republic's children) faster in all schools so that we stop the massacre of our Republic's intellectual children. <sep><sep> Many of the 52 participants in the recent Training Course have volunteered to be in the Groups. <sep><sep> These words brought tears to the eyes of Jabal Bourrbak. <sep><sep> All these types of class struggle, it is, it is there. <sep><sep> In China and Russia, the financial capital has also nurtured private debt. <sep><sep> So, all this to say, before we start the discussion, the class struggle has all kinds of manifestations. <sep><sep> Level of STRUGGLE, we will continue this mobilization campaign before and after Bidze for an Alternative Economy facing the capitalist economic crisis system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, today we will find the center of our new Social Consensus, which is part of the construction of a new "Historical Block". <sep><sep> It is a meeting that he had agreed to attend to assist his brother. <sep><sep> Indeed, this work, as a way to help people, is starting off very well in the education system. <sep><sep> A mother (50 years old) who was on a hunger strike in Nabluz died this week. <sep><sep> Many people will remember the repression against the press that existed at that time when journalists, editors in chief, had to assist in the court inside the Parliament. <sep><sep> This motion to continue the suspension of the Youth Group, no one voted against. <sep><sep> Therefore, Minister Martin is responsible for some children, as he answers to the State's plea that answers to these children. <sep><sep> During these 5 years, MMM has been weakened by internal crises, where there have been a series of resignations from regional instances. <sep><sep> To replace him as leader and ensure a new leadership of MMM that represents the people that L'Estrac believed were not adequately represented in the country. <sep><sep> As happened successfully in Jabara yesterday evening. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So on Tuesday, we are not going to have class in the morning. <sep><sep> Apparently, in the countryside, Bel Air and Riviere des Anguilles are moving too fast even, it seems. <sep><sep> Or, when there are no access to land, they create a planting cooperative to gain access to land. <sep><sep> If there is a certain demand, then the workers should work overtime, when the workers are not too ready to work overtime on demand which is supposed to be met in advance. <sep><sep> The employers have a contract with a Palestinian who is contracted with a fair employer. <sep><sep> All individuals in this class lead this lifestyle – and the workers are starting to realize this. <sep><sep> On the second day, through a Bidze, you can pronounce the same in favor of establishing bases for a re-orientation in productive activity. <sep><sep> There has been a challenge of "national liberation" in all former colonies, where the workers are seeking independence from the colonizers, the people of the colonies. <sep><sep> We are in a position of Opposition now, with a little support in the past for the Chagossians, not today. <sep><sep> In terms of law, there is no proportionate measure of the legal crisis in the country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mother tongue is a scaffold, on which to build other languages and all knowledge. <sep><sep> He has started to make exits against ICAC, against the Government. <sep><sep> The army used this pretext for arbitrary detentions. <sep><sep> What kind of bossiness should be on the personality of this category of employees? <sep><sep> Eat curry in all big restaurants and in village / town centers. <sep><sep> He explained how when the tax increases, this affects family income - it diminishes, and it brings extreme misery. <sep><sep> For the moment, the Government is putting all its efforts in "diplomacy" to save or reduce the implications of the price reduction that Lerop has announced. <sep><sep> Nor have we found too many actions (by these individuals) against the war and occupation of Iraq, which has led to nearly 350,000 deaths to date. <sep><sep> - Gete Bal, your health is not allowing you to take care of the house as you should.. <sep><sep> LALIT supports this action against the Israeli State and in solidarity with the Palestinian people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Working in the sugar industry is a sector that traditionally represents large planters, medium-sized planters, and medium entrepreneurs. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who spoke at the LALIT Press Conference on March 17, warned the Government that it is time for him to act to ensure that the Resolution on the Chagos and Diego Garcia Draft is deposited in anticipation of the next session of the United Nations General Assembly <sep><sep> Many people ask us, "Why does Lalit have so many female candidates?" <sep><sep> It is a film that began as a documentary on a very chaotic market with its 2 companies and a different life in different villages in the depths of the Nizer countryside <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen is leading a case against the WTO and threatening to withdraw from social services and human rights <sep><sep> Yosi put his hand on his wife's belly <sep><sep> Work in manufacturing and service sectors such as BPO has slowed down <sep><sep> He said that this region was relatively backward in development, rather rural, and did not have a strong bourgeoisie <sep><sep> So today there are more NGOs and sponsored associations, where their activities are financed by the State through the NGO Trust Fund, by private firms and even by certain Embassies <sep><sep> So, when he talks this afternoon, he will tell us not only about Diego but also about military bases around the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They do not have a well-defined political program, often, and they have serious internal security issues, where the CIA etc. have been able to infiltrate them, and control them to a large extent, through Facebook and Twitter. <sep><sep> In 1990, 70.6% of people said they speak Creole at home more than any other language. <sep><sep> We have 25 minutes, 10 PPS, Deputy Speaker, Chief Whip, and no more government backbenchers. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister should stick to the plan of the establishment or company specified in his contract. <sep><sep> When modern slavery occurs and the working class has the right to choose between working for a wage or becoming independent. <sep><sep> This means that where we view workers as a producer and not just as a consumer, this is an important point. <sep><sep> Thirdly, in 2010 the Labor Party is constantly trying to negotiate with the British. <sep><sep> A school must accept the reality, the context of children in school. <sep><sep> In a way, it is also something they care about because it is really a convention. <sep><sep> It is a moment where we need to mobilize to strengthen its action. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Where is LALIT, we have been raising the alarm bell for a long time about the economic crisis. <sep><sep> It is true that a part of this money, goes into a fund, but there is also a part that goes directly into the process. <sep><sep> * As for the IRS village, even though 336 have been sold (and their development is quite remarkable), there are still 573 that have not been able to sell for 7 years. <sep><sep> "Why does Mr. Capitalist have 1,000 sheep, while I don't have one?" a peasant woman asked. <sep><sep> We will surely discuss this class struggle between the two main classes in capitalism: capitalists and workers. <sep><sep> - Ecological dimension, being given that it is a power station that runs on coal, therefore causing pollution for the inhabitants of the Albion region and surroundings. <sep><sep> and the way some of these electricity-producing companies, as established entities, have invested 500 million rupees in their thermal power station, and in 3 years have made over 600 million rupees in profits. <sep><sep> When they award this, it was applicable to all transport companies. <sep><sep> You may consider this a question in certain cases, cases where corruption allows. <sep><sep> We have this book if there is a journalist who wants a copy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is even a society for when you finish dying: the Society of Death. <sep> <sep> Primeminister, the Finance Minister did not mention the party that all growth and all profit increases he cited together with its revenue increase in the budget because of VAT (2 billion rupees increase). <sep> <sep> You can't enter, you tell the boss to give you a thousand rupees each time for that job. <sep> <sep> Ragini Kistnasamy, a member of LALIT, was invited to witness the testimony while the other Dayeri Palestinian he wrote during his 2 visits to Palestine. <sep> <sep> In the Best Loser system for communal reasons, there will no longer be a reason why there is Proportional Representation and that there are 4 members per constituency. <sep> <sep> This kind of compensation is what PT is used to do. <sep> <sep> Everyone is perplexed by this budget, this issue needs to be addressed. <sep> <sep> There is a great contradiction because hotels, there are great difficulties and your replacement. <sep> <sep> "The Loter has created a linguistic exchange frenzy with its array of imaging tournaments, with the economy of words. <sep> And this creates confusion, demoralization and in a way accentuates communalism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>So, I started by searching in issue number 58 of "Lalit de Klas", then I searched in the Lalit Review from issue number 59 to 91, in issue 86 of the "Lalit" newspaper. <sep><sep>Then, the other person said "Go write down my request on this paper for Rs600,000" Then, the other the Bank or another investor, he bought a debt. <sep><sep>This year in Mauritius and in other countries, we went through a food crisis. <sep><sep>Often the canaries in the yard would add their input. <sep><sep>Already in 1981, there were 2 LALIT militants, Ragini Kistnasamy and Lindsey Collen, among those 8 families who pursued the POA, after a demonstration on the Diego Garcia issue. <sep><sep>The first news is that a soldier has died and several others were wounded. <sep><sep>In this confrontation, there is another problem. <sep><sep>[next to: And I'm not saying this just because of Ton Auguste!] It was important to contact the OAU. <sep><sep>Because Marx has taught us, among other things, by these moments, these moments where it becomes possible, and where reality can even, with our desire, acquire a certain inevitability towards a sanction in favor of the masses ordaining. <sep><sep>(2) Replace asbestos panels in houses where more than 3000 families live, where they are exposed to a dangerous health threat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT is moving forward with a movement outside Parliament based on a mobilization program. <sep><sep> Our first simple demand: Section 49 should specify: "The official languages of the Assembly are English and Mauritian Creole, but any member can speak in French or Bhojpuri". <sep><sep> At the same time, the launch of the Lalit book, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVES: AGRICULTURE, AGRO-INDUSTRY & ELECTRICITY. <sep><sep> it's diverting debate and obstructing a resolution in favor of people's power. <sep><sep> It says like this, in its program it tells you, its strategies, its priorities are to advance the interests of the working class. <sep><sep> It was not going to continue, Jean-Claude thought. <sep><sep> BEFORE the Intifada uprisings (especially men), the first and second Intifadas were led by children and youth who were at the forefront, today the role of women in the forefront for Palestinian freedom is crucial. <sep><sep> This law-draft included the following clauses: <sep><sep> In place of these 5 departments, it has established a start of an "office" called "Mauritius Revenue Authority" which will act as an "agent" for the Government. <sep><sep> We do not know, but what happened is the boss of Anna Establishment has stopped them from working, asking them to wait at the Office. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie exerts a great influence in its determination of political power. <sep>
<sep> Bizlall decreed that "Le Mouvement Premier Mai has chosen the path of self-effacement as a means of building a broad, mass political force." <sep>
<sep> The debate was lively with many speakers and the participation of several union militants and active members of the planters' association as well as militants from Lalit. <sep>
<sep> Such a crisis could have very dangerous social repercussions, apart from the evident economic repercussions: social cohesion in the countryside still heavily relies on the activities of sugar cane and mill plantations. <sep>
<sep> As everyone knows, Prime Minister Berenger announced that Parliament would be dissolved before polling day. <sep>
<sep> - What should we do with his three Sadous? - Send them to learn gymnastics. <sep>
<sep> And there are objective problems like the constitution of these two alliances that are creating a breeding ground for extremists. <sep>
<sep> Many of us have met for the first time at the World Social Forum and other virtual meetings to build a global voice. <sep>
<sep> because he, like others in LALIT such as Cadet Couyava, started in the Independent Forward Block with the Bisoondoyal brothers, before becoming a delegate for the MMM in '72 amid repression. <sep>
<sep> He does not finance the union, he does not finance the confederation, he finances the federation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The trade union mobilization was more decisive in a May Day conference. <sep><sep> Often Karnon used to turn in a bad way and the other side had to let him go. <sep><sep> When you express your political will in this way, you are ensuring the Prime Minister, as Leader Haws, that he has the necessary majority. <sep><sep> - there is a Creole Unit in MIE to train teachers and Creole language trainers, <sep><sep> Princess Prathna entered the little room even though people believed she could catch the disease through simple contact. <sep><sep> So, we have to integrate all these important sanctions, and realize that their participation sometimes directly sometimes indirectly in the Lalit Campaign. <sep><sep> When we do big things, then it goes back to inner peace, or they do not cover it all! <sep><sep> Analysis of the decision of the Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Nations Zini LALIT found that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples found in disgust over the disqualification of candidates not communitizing the community on the candidate form. <sep><sep> Bachoo became No. 4 in government while Boolell was only No. 5. <sep><sep> Last year, if MLC, PWU, did not sign the agreement, could it have become binding? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> R.S. explained that when Israel began issuing permits for the demolition of mirrors, the army used a 'stop order' to halt the construction of the school. <sep>
<sep> We believe that concession companies should contribute to a fund so that we can receive an allocation until we get another job. <sep>
<sep> And what has just happened to those 30,000 tiny cane planters who were not employed are people who have only gone to work on the basis of an interest in real common action even if part of the canes. <sep>
<sep> LALIT will launch a campaign so that the Government starts immediately and acts on that part. <sep>
<sep> As I said, the cases have brought a fantastic level of international consciousness. <sep>
<sep> It will not allow a true democracy, which allows workers to guarantee all these rights to it. <sep>
<sep> And it is through this relationship of independence, which we want to develop a common program. <sep>
<sep> Ram Seegobin has detailed the Lalit proposal for agricultural diversification on a large scale. <sep>
<sep> We have a section on all these reserves that are very rich in this "Let Uver". 
<sep> all our sympathizers who have actively participated in our activities and supported our work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are details in his book "Midnight in the Century, The Case of Comrade Tulayev, and The Long Dusk." <sep><sep> It is a narrative that has a direction, so the people, in a more formal manner, can express their dissatisfaction with violence, in the stories that the narrative can present significantly in the name of the people. <sep><sep> Everyone from Mauritius and Rodrigues who followed our teacher training course, our courses in learning Creole and other courses on languages. <sep><sep> Explain about the Olive Harvest which is starting well because of Ramadan on the 15th of October. <sep><sep> In reality, it does not become the same as in my previous part; I will return to the issue between citizens and the law. <sep><sep> In 1983, in our program, we had already set: <sep><sep> There was a representative of the private sector of Mauritius on the same stage. <sep><sep> If you take care of your mind, I will take care of your garden. <sep><sep> Then, there is communalism and Best Loser, this is also a point where Lalit has greatly improved. <sep><sep> The government sets up the TUTF from the start, puts money into it, chances to help the trade union movement develop its capacities in technological exchange, research, and documentation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, after a week where all workers and artisans have been working, a week starting on the 7th of October, then doc and transport come in. <sep>
<sep> So, when the unionist Subron speaks of the "great victory" when there is a 20% increase instead of a 16% increase for a temporary worker who remains in a sector that the historic Block has devastated, he is mistaken in tragedy. <sep>
<sep> In other words, like a lottery, the lottery winner has fallen into despair, burying his head in the sand so he cannot be found. <sep>
<sep> While one side is trying to push for a 10% increase, on the other hand, the Best Loser communal side is keeping the door wide open for sectoral and religious parties! <sep>
<sep> There is only an agreement where taxes for middle-class people buying a house up to Rs4 million are concerned. <sep>
<sep> It's a report that, for most of us, has only been at the oral level and reflects the low status that has been imposed on our language. <sep>
<sep> Alain asks him, "What happened to the interview with Ram?" Only then did the journalist call Ram to say that he had "lost his pen", or rather, he mistakenly claimed, perhaps someone has taken his pen from his desk. <sep>
<sep> In terms of politics, PT, MMM, MSM, and PMSD are obliged to make their positions clear to the public. <sep>
<sep> and even with some political movements through their unions. <sep>
<sep> This year's theme is "International Workers' Solidarity" against the capitalist crisis a time that is well framed and what is happening today in the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To Work in a recent job on the question "terminology" in languages. <sep><sep> Make medium only English, Make medium only mother tongue, Make mother tongue for oral. <sep><sep> The Creole writing has been popularized by publications MMMSP, MLF, LPT, Immedia, by books written and especially by LALIT which since 1976 has been publishing political texts in Creole. <sep><sep> - As an Association, we only have the right to communicate with authorities on the condition that we are mastering a foreign language, namely English or French; <sep><sep> So, we must therefore constantly seek to define a program that: <sep><sep> Face the global warming crisis, already some countries are moving towards the use of renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, energy from waves and tidal power. <sep><sep> It was admiring the ground in the hole, his son's face was lighting up and quickly a little smile, a little dirty but clear immediately took the place of sad suffering. <sep><sep> I just told him I was there because I invited him (I wanted to tell him that he and his laments against uninvited pain neither here nor in Palestine. <sep><sep> This Trilateral Commission literally controlled the administration of Jimmy Carter (President of the USA 1977-81). <sep><sep> As he was a handsome boy and his acting talent was admired, he was caught between many secret fears. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A family party - 25 men in uniform at the check-in point are waiting for the clear sound of their ID. <sep><sep> There is an important link between an individual (such as, for example, Gerard Louise) and his group (Cassiya), and between groups like Playgroup, a whole organization, and individual members (Pushpa Lallah). <sep><sep> If you are getting a violation, because you are driving without a license, without a declaration, you will see that violations exist within it. <sep><sep> For the director of Lalit, Lindsey Collen in the Court of District No 3 Port Louis yesterday, there were many Lalit activists and social organizations present in the gallery. <sep><sep> Even the press has discovered this play that Subron is playing with the Minister, or who she gets from Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> In such a situation, one must look at how the union movement will react. <sep><sep> This was expected from the MMM in 1969, and also, their Marxist tendencies were quite strong. <sep><sep> We say it is natural because the dominant ideology in the working class is a reformist ideology, meaning that workers in general are looking for small reforms within the dominant system and the social democratic movement themselves, they have a reformist program. <sep><sep> Analysis of the experience in Latin America and the firm integration in The State of Food and Agriculture 1998. <sep><sep> It is worth mentioning that, I too, I remember when I first started learning about modern ecology, I formally learned (the conversation went like this) that my ecology was not useful until the 1950s. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen also discussed two peaceful situations since Karl Marx's work. <sep><sep> the whites came, on the other side of her China, her white her black, that is, Americans. <sep><sep> Balram, who was having a lot of difficulties at the time because of his illness, wanted to protest but he preferred to stay calm because Timi was not in a mood to discuss. <sep><sep> The tax bulletin, which the tax committee began to establish, where workers in all sectors, all unions, began to contribute their help in every establishment. <sep><sep> - Yosi, my love, there's a dance for your fiance here. <sep><sep> Comrade Yannick and Kisna also had the opportunity to leave the city of Havana and visit Santa Clara. <sep><sep> what she said was God's gift and her kingdom was greater than Samazeste Toupoumwa. <sep><sep> Brans Lalit Rose-Hill organized a film session and debate on Saturday 15 Ziyet on the situation in Palestine and the Indian Ocean Division. <sep><sep> Secondly, political parties no longer believe they need to have a social vision. <sep><sep> Gianduth Khaytoo (known as Ramesh Khaytoo), founding member and activist of Lalit, who died on Wednesday 29 November following a cerebral attack. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The young plant also brought his bed from class against various enemies. <sep> Princess Prathna, Yosi and their eleven friends only appeared in front of him. <sep> Today he is in Venezuela.) But, there has not been a real victory against capitalism. <sep> Celebrating May 22, an important date for the Cuban revolution, was underway. <sep> The Americans have taken a big boat (I believe they called it Layter). <sep> We believe that all people who reflect a little, agreed that we need to apply this possibility of a reduction in punishment in all prisons, in all forms. <sep> Put a special tax on establishments that refuse to plant food on a certain percentage of their agricultural land. <sep> When the time comes for you to engage in LALIT's political mobilization for an alternative economy. <sep> There's no debate there, no insider report where a violent man is exposed in public debate on violence against women. <sep> geographically, Mauritius thrives on its food supplies, its seafood and other food products; <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation of the Chagos and Diego Garcia archipelago is controlled by Americans and the island of Tromelin is controlled by France. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, these branches are establishing strict democratic rules that are more beneficial to the working class. <sep> <sep> Today it takes too much time before workers are compensated for work accidents; some cases drag on for up to ten years. <sep> <sep> As for the Palestinians, this year we have witnessed many advances. <sep> <sep> Everything we have learned while building our campaign has strengthened it and given it a clearer direction. <sep> <sep> Currently, Spain and Italy are not far behind Greece in terms of the debt crisis. <sep> <sep> Minister Boolell has presented a Road Map, a 10-year plan that will cost around 23.5 billion rupees, where nearly half will come from national taxes. <sep> <sep> They prefer to remain calm on the sidelines, as Kayah has found death in a police cell. <sep> <sep> Sometimes, in the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th year, they are still relieved. <sep> <sep> We also expect that a political party has a political practice that encourages female participation, as well as that of men. <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> then the nationalization of an institution (Rose-Belle), the nationalization of electricity production with CEB, the establishment of a State Bank, the creation of SICOM. <sep><sep> He even said a key sentence that encompasses everything, when he says how difficult it is, as a journalist, to read Creole. <sep><sep> When we talk about working class, its union organizes itself into three confederations. <sep><sep> So we now have a new figure to look at in our minds. <sep><sep> 90% suffer from stress issues, nightmares, bed-wetting, anxiety, and trauma after they were let go. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna laughed a little laugh as rare as a crystal clear drop falling with a splash. <sep><sep> In reality, you are asking for punishment in the name of a community. <sep><sep> There is Dan Callikan who now directs the government propaganda boat, there is Alain Laridon who is now the workers' ambassador. <sep><sep> Although there were two well-established parties, which had deputies in parliament, due to the proportional DSD system they had six seats in the municipal council. <sep><sep> the big mansion they used to brag about - sometimes out of knowledge that it's a mansion, sometimes because someone powerful is pleased to hear those foolish things. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this to say, when the family works hard, then they are acquiring experience. <sep><sep> Then it becomes too difficult for the insurance industry. <sep><sep> This means during the strike, you get a delegate, you get workers, who come into the movement in the front lines and they stand as a vanguard. <sep><sep> A person who has nothing to sell except his strength, what we call in Creole - with extraordinary precision - his "courage." <sep><sep> So, this is a demanding quality that when explaining why this demand is necessary, you need to develop an argument where you attack the patriarchal system. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, when the UN Right to Free Committee Report came out, it created a funny debate: <sep><sep> And in the meantime, the Civil Service announces they will be organizing a solemn demonstration, but we don't have details yet. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin took a tour of the political situation, and Alain Ah-Vee presented a report on LALIT activities for 2012. <sep><sep> Hence, we all have an obligation to recruit new members. <sep><sep> 80% go bankrupt within 3 years after they are created. The same company forms again. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We can find out why the head of L'Express came into block 104 with Ashok Subron and Jack Bizlall. <sep><sep> Elsewhere, the small planter associations are developing and finding their political voice in the Advance Group, a political group that opposed the Labor Party in the 1948 elections. <sep><sep> They all have shared experiences and some traumatizing ones, that they went through when they were not allowed to speak their native language in schools. <sep><sep> Among our candidates are workers, drivers, a female bus conductor, a gardener, doctor, student, manager, and a watchman. <sep><sep> COLON THE LANDLORD AND POLICEMEN AGAINST PLANTERS AND INHABITANTS. <sep><sep> Tear gas, smoke bombs, stun grenades, and when they approach you, the big physical bodies lean on you. <sep><sep> For example, if there is a demonstration today at Gris-Gris, how should our actions be as members? <sep><sep> some people have gone to the authorities to pay the workers of the sugar industry well, to have an increase every month. <sep><sep> Comrade Jane: Perhaps I am confused in my head, but I prefer to express myself, so that I don't regret when I go home, that I haven't spoken! There is a lot of division. <sep><sep> A party in favor of socialism, it's a party with a political program, not just simple "values" that amount to nothing more than hypocritical "pieties." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, we found that the concept of "citizen," equality before the law, is primarily a formal theoretical matter. <sep><sep> Furthermore, it is also important to note that it is through political struggle that we envisage changing the existing economy, an economy that exacerbates all the problems in society. <sep><sep> We also have to work hard to overcome this. <sep><sep> After that, we experienced the collapse of the international financial system (which almost collapsed, and ended up in ICU), which triggered an economic crisis that was already on the horizon. <sep><sep> Following this, the Supreme Court ruling and the campaign led by the feminist movement and all progressive forces led, in 1987, the government to repeal provisions on the Minimum Prescribed Allowance in the law. <sep><sep> This witness contained frivolities such as "Fer Bismillah, desann Babal," and frivolous scenarios such as "Al rod Rama Valayden," and nobody "Al rod Bagwan." <sep><sep> Anil Gayan has repeated many times that Mauritius has no objection to the presence of US military on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> For the first time, Mauritius has filed an official motion at the United Nations to address the issue of Diego and the Chagos Archipelago at the upcoming UN General Assembly, 45th session, United Nations. <sep><sep> And these are the conditions, the gang workers in the sugarcane fields, which will become a model on which capitalist industrialization will be based. <sep><sep> It is absolutely important that we have a very different program from this "National Front" under the leadership of Navin Ramgoolam. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A project that continues in the Island Network, which has been developed with educators from LPT, Playgroup, Terre de Paix, and numerous BECs, is used to teach in the Creole language. <sep><sep> But today, the Director of the MSRA has said that Ethanol production in Mauritius will not be competitive in the global market. <sep><sep> There are indeed gangs within the team, with looters, hitters, and big shots controlling the show. <sep><sep> Among the protesters, there were many members of LPT who are also members of the LALIT. <sep><sep> When Ganga had a transition, he had already completed his authority in his field, but at the same time a university career had started losing its grip. <sep><sep> In the context of the food crisis affecting many countries worldwide, we find that the Government is enforcing a development policy that aims to misuse land that could have been used for food production. <sep><sep> When the canal and basin were being redesigned, people advised against it because mosquitoes would become a problem. <sep><sep> Many NGOs and unions are striving to obtain the funds. <sep><sep> But the scope of the Public-Private Partnership goes beyond its general benefits. <sep><sep> Will it be Paul Berenger who will do this in a PT-MMM government? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And they can tell you that one must have a majority of employees in that bargaining unit for some situations to easily happen, either in a landslide victory or a draw. <sep><sep> [We are republishing this article from Le Militant as a dossier, even though it is 21 years old, so that readers can understand to what extent Bérenger, L'Estrac, Gobine and Ahnee were involved in a night-time conspiracy and attacks against LALIT. <sep><sep> If the boss does not take them back, the Government will provide them with an alternative job. <sep><sep> During 3-4 years (1996-1999), we experienced a bit of trade union bureaucracy in the All Workers' Conference. <sep><sep> Here in Mauritius, we will certainly see the working class launch another attack against capitalism (historical and bourgeois). <sep><sep> When we look at what is happening at the political level during elections in Mauritius, political politics, meaning everything we find in parliament and in the newspapers. <sep><sep> So the decision that was made is to go on a hunger strike without eating or drinking. <sep><sep> This fits in with a new spirit of public transparency in the decisions taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions. <sep><sep> Berenger, for his part, his strategy is as elaborate as Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> He has become a rebel who is defying his father. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Setadir Reeaz is discussing definitions of classes that tend to favor the liberal ideology. <sep><sep> The new LPT Campaign in favor of the Creole LPT Language has launched its book 200 pages in Creole & Bhojpuri Maternal Language: A Bilingual Handbook on Mother-Tongues as part of its campaign in favor of mother-tongue languages as a medium in schools. <sep><sep> One group is already working on digitizing LPT's Creole-English Dictionary and putting it online. <sep><sep> Papa Timi, who had distanced himself from the Timi-Balram family, had started to form an attachment with Ramba in his later years. <sep><sep> Often we hear in Mauritius people do not unionize, when in a country like France, only 20-25% do not unionize. <sep><sep> Instead of holding a referendum as planned by PMSD to be based on its campaign against Independence ("The boat our language is dying," "Independence = hunger," and images of starving children, etc.). <sep><sep> So, what about these two figures, as an electorate, if you only look at these two candidates? <sep><sep> Creole language - which has finally been introduced in primary schools. <sep><sep> I appreciate that you have decided to come and tell me.” The formal protest against the contents is clear. <sep><sep> But Sithanen did not come up with measures that could bring an orientation in the development strategies to face such crises in such a way that where workers and the poor can benefit. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He refused to let the Minister of Finance to deal with this situation. <sep><sep> But, when we go to the shop, when we go to buy soap, when we go to buy flour, when we go to buy grapes, if we are going uphill, when we get blocked, is it possible, feasible, that we get this "early harvest"? <sep><sep> The government has controlled all citrus production. <sep><sep> While Nann was looking after Manann, Fatma noticed that all the guests, the DDT, were correct. <sep><sep> "In conclusion, we warn people firmly against irrational reactions for the sake of health and excessive punishment, as the only solution to feed. <sep><sep> Some say it will bring ethnic or linguistic divisions. <sep><sep> But what they are all saying is that they still agree with the Lalit program and that there is disagreement among the resignations who have said they want to continue to fight against the Lalit branches. <sep><sep> The example of the village Deir Balut gives an idea of daily life where people need to stand against Miray, a symbol of Israeli military occupation. <sep><sep> He had ordered a case for a trial in conformity with the opinion of the ICJ (International Court of Justice). <sep><sep> And in every country, Marx explained, there is its own government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This contributes to a better conscience in class. <sep> <sep> At certain moments, a totally ridiculous hope that this new Con-Lib-Dem government will have a different attitude because especially the Liberal Democrats in the past have spoken in favor of the Chagossians, in favor of Mauritius on the Chagos issue. <sep> <sep> It is a calculated kind of communalism, deliberately provoking in its calculation, so that in the end it proposes itself as the "savior." <sep> <sep> But it is a government that must ensure decent work for its population. <sep> <sep> If anyone wants a strong reason to laugh, they are given one. <sep> <sep> No punishment that capitalism brings, no punishment that the concept of "citizen" brings, it says you can no longer buy a "citizen" now. <sep> <sep> Apart from the MBC, which has a duty to "accountable" <sep> <sep> After the independence of Sri Lanka in 1948, successive regimes have maintained and even accentuated this political division and oppression. <sep> <sep> So the colonial government should be able to ensure control over the entire economy, and should be able to intervene strictly in the way social evolution occurs. <sep> <sep> The show organized by Lazans Immedia was entirely in Creole and lasted about 3 hours. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, when there are climate changes, when cyclones hit Australia, what do we find? <sep><sep> The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and the National Human Rights Commission have criticized the Government for the lack of respect for the right to education in the mother tongue. <sep><sep> We can say that 25 years have passed to show that adults can read and write everywhere in urban and rural areas of Mauritius and Rodrigues in the same script. <sep><sep> There is a new interest in the theater of light in Mauritius with this 17th edition of Limur 100% Mauritian, as well as the events organized regularly by the Caravan Events. <sep><sep> Solidarity with the union leaders who have been laid off at Mauritius Telecom. <sep><sep> The army has been in a half-finished building near the village of Orif, Kifl Hares, Jamme'en. <sep><sep> Many people are present in an action that is uncertain in a front line, it is not important if it is everyone. <sep><sep> Inorganic things like soil, topsoil, become plants, become animals, go back into the soil, go back into the air, and it is already an ecological reflection. <sep><sep> There is a wedding on Friday and many people are in the lanes, so the presence of IWPS is not necessary. <sep><sep> But his political movement had a leader, the MMM. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The LPT dictionary is in electronic form on this website. <sep><sep> But it's the way in which people present themselves at meetings, which we are in the Political Bureau. <sep><sep> But, despite all this great insistence on the mother tongue, the State only uses Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> The census will not find them as tenants but as more owners. <sep><sep> Often Navin Ramgoolam makes this threat, so that people are starting to take it seriously. <sep><sep> All this, to say at an international level, that there is a beginning of a rally against the capitalist ideology. <sep><sep> In the construction sector it is quite low because there are very few employees. <sep><sep> When you are not threatening, when you are not challenging, the economic system that is in place today, but when you do not challenge it directly and clearly, it will bring confusion. <sep><sep> Scientists have identified 9 point which are critical. <sep><sep> Timol Brothers who are targeting; "politicians" Economic sector concerned; State Land. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The current language policy involves the use of English or French as a medium, especially from the first year, and even more so from pre-primary. <sep><sep> It has drawn attention to the various volunteer work that different members have done, to dismantle machines, paint walls and doors, install vinyl floors, refurbish new furniture and paint them, arrange 2 pretty new dining tables, and repair the dining table. <sep><sep> The Israeli government has a deliberate policy of colonizing Palestine. <sep><sep> - How do you know? - Have they not heard it calling us? <sep><sep> But what we must not forget is the global economic crisis that is making the Chinese government's position strong, it can bring its implementation to a halt like a lamp if it is not closed its military bases by trickery. <sep><sep> Cindy Clelie announced the date of the INTERNATIONAL LALIT CONGRESS for 1, 2, 3 February in Horl LPT, GRNW. <sep><sep> He said that while tourism has increased, hotels have become numerous, but your replacement is decreasing. <sep><sep> And there was a Critique Session on the current political situation by Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> On the other hand, what she aims at is allowing the boss to increase the working hours without increasing the wages, organizing production time as he wishes, reducing wages by reducing overtime pay. <sep><sep> After this conflict, MSPA said that it will have a 2,000-acre site for the government and agree to have Hunton & Williams, experts, re-examine the IPP and CEB contracts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A country like Lasinn, it has a commercial surplus trade with the USA because it exports many products there compared to what it imports from there. <sep> Additionally, it exposes a small loophole in our knowledge of these matters. <sep> This Flotilla 6 boat trip, organized by the Free Gaza Movement, was in the process of bringing in 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid. <sep> The rebellion had a civilian struggle when fighting primarily against Gaddafi, but NATO, France, and the UK have shifted to one side in the civilian strife and have taken sides with the military forces. <sep> So, we have no choice but to turn to the Prime Minister, along with other Ministers especially the Minister of Justice, to take on their responsibilities for the state's violence. <sep> In the citadel of Trousanfon, everyone, from its governor down to its cleaner, had equal dignity. <sep> The driver gets off and requires all passengers to disembark from the bus. <sep> * Immediate withdrawal request proposed by the MMM-MSM-PMSD-FTS-Greens Government <sep> The concept and propaganda of "24/7" that we have experienced in Mauritius is at its end, following an impasse set by the bosses, with great pressure to not pay overtly. <sep> The economic crisis has also affected the bourgeois state institutions: Zidisyer, the Police, CCID. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the context of the Concert Against Police Violence, Radio France Internationale interviewed LALIT member Rajni Lallah on the issue of police brutality. <sep><sep> What we are currently experiencing is a period of transition between a system that was entirely regulated by the state, where peace and working conditions were regulated by state institutions, and we are moving towards a situation where peace and working conditions will be regulated more by the Collective Court between unions and employers. <sep><sep> This interview appears in yesterday's newspapers merely by coincidence! <sep><sep> One of the controls (or I was theoretically) that a worker has on his union is through membership fees. <sep><sep> The process of re-establishing international ties has begun in the last year. <sep><sep> For example, the European colonial system started in the 15th century. And after that, in the past only 250 years, a new social class has managed to gain power. <sep><sep> And it is their contribution that will help us understand the current situation in Mauritius, the crisis that Mauritius is going through. <sep><sep> Let's not look for where God emerged from; that's another problem. <sep><sep> In light of statements made by Minister Soodhun and Vice Prime Minister Paul Berenger regarding the IRA issue, the betrayal of various governments on this issue since 1982, GWF demands 3 immediate actions from the government. <sep><sep> The Guardian Weekly, a widely circulated newspaper in England, has picked up on the findings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are other sectors like Taher, Hassen Taher. <sep> Part of it is in 600 cities in the USA, exactly identifying what is the capital, financial capital, what is the cause of the problem. <sep> So, they prefer to classify workers, as opposed to electing. <sep> When the PTr rules this State, it rules a colonial State that has the same power as the colonial State had. <sep> It is an election that directly follows from a partisan electoral arrangement between MSM and MMM that took place a few weeks before the last general election. <sep> There has been a lot of work done to recognize the mother tongue. <sep> Then there is a central role collapse in the economy itself. <sep> For example, when there is a blue-white-red government with Jugnauth and Travayis in it, there are conflicts. <sep> This is not because the language itself is inferior, but because people who speak it are often treated as if they are inferior. <sep> (c) All commercialization of GMO plant traits, which are not necessary in today's world, must be done with the "precautionary principle". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As a British, they have the right to legalize. <sep> But we had to make the decision, and we made the decision. <sep> They tell that tears have entered the village, bombs have been thrown. <sep> Our existence is based on a program and whether it's a dynamic program, which evolves and adapts to new situations, it allows us to survive. <sep> given that the press in general encounters many difficulties in understanding the size of industrial relations, and often refers to this kind of manipulation. <sep> Management will have to produce dividends for that board, if it doesn't produce dividends, the board will push it out, to replace it. <sep> And today I am sharing a perspective of this key book with you. <sep> He doesn't say at all happy that Bachoo, who is not a worst worker and director, has surpassed him in ministerial hierarchy. <sep> He is special because it signifies the beginning of the end of that contempt, that oppression that has persisted against our mother tongue. <sep> But, despite this, because in 2011 it was necessary to concentrate on technical aspects of the Creole language, it makes it difficult for this identity course to operate, in spite of that. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to demonstrate to prevent the crisis of food insecurity. <sep><sep> To explain the link between political leadership of Lalit de Klas, vanguard workers, and casual workers, I will narrate a brief history of workers' leaflets. <sep><sep> His novels "There is a Tide", "The Rape of Sita", "Getting Rid of It", "Mutiny", "Mission of Boy" (in Kreol), "Boy" all reflect life and reality in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Also, two members of Lalit, Ally Hosenbokus and Lindsey Collen, have informally reported that there was an informal meeting organized by members of the Lalit last week, at which the election date would be discussed. <sep><sep> He criticized Rama Valayden and PMSD, and led an ungrounded campaign on the issue of Subutex and the Christian Church. <sep><sep> It means you have to take a service (minibus like a taxi-train) from Biddy's to the roadblock. <sep><sep> Apparently, Bidze is speeding up privatization in education, health, and parastatals, as if he is using the term "privatization." <sep><sep> Since 1983, it has been a political demand in our political program. <sep><sep> Demand a mass conversion to organic and green methods of food production on a large scale, for local consumption and export. <sep><sep> We are trying to figure out exactly what needs to be criticized, what needs to be replaced because you're going bankrupt, you're rotting. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The DDT members met several times to evaluate the situation and decide what could be done. <sep> <sep> But it is a warmth that reassures my mother, that gives her her value, her importance, her exclusive power - in short, her family pride in the house. <sep> <sep> There, you will find a kind of trade unionism, despite the 4 positive and important things it does, it also has the means to stabilize the system. <sep> <sep> The former major sectors still have some freedom and democracy that they have inherited from the past decades. <sep> <sep> 24 years later, with happy memories, I have enjoyed rereading some of them. <sep> <sep> Nowadays, many people say, a worker is asleep, he does not speak, and we have to pass on this experience that a worker can speak, and can speak lengthwise and at length. <sep> <sep> and many others for a long time, these organizations represent a major basis for support. <sep> <sep> Mauritius has surrendered and the Chagossians have been banished because the USA wanted to buy land from other people for a military base. <sep> <sep> That means 2/3 of the population will support you in this incident. <sep> <sep> But it also represents opportunities for the state bourgeoisie in Mauritius to collaborate with these projects coming from other countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You have filled my life like the time in my lungs, like the sun in the sky, like rain on Mars... like... like... like the roar of a cyclone... <sep><sep> But also, just like Israel uses Israeli citizens, many immigrants, to allow it to use this as an excuse for the security of its citizens to maintain its military presence in Palestine. <sep><sep> As it has allowed the working class to organize and participate in this work to develop this consciousness in favor of international solidarity at the level of the labor sector and in neighborhoods where workers reside. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie has succeeded in transforming the MMM to represent itself politically, and this is at a time when the PT-PMSD has been discredited. <sep><sep> On the other hand, there are other issues that are not being discussed in public: monopoly on the exploitation of salts and sugars, new distribution of shares (which is now 76-24%) between planters. <sep><sep> And now, here I am talking about Letya Zini and Great Britain at this moment in time." <sep><sep> Workers will continue to believe in our strength, and they will have reasons to do so. <sep><sep> The problem in the Eurozone has caused more pressure since the JEC and the Mauritius Employers' Federation to devalue the Rupee. <sep><sep> Today, with the Euro Crisis affecting the value of Mauritian exports, when this becomes an added crisis to the systemic crisis, we know that the Mauritian economy will suffer. <sep><sep> LALIT says that the Government should not allow the Opposition to join forces in order to postpone partial elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Given that women often have less confidence in their abilities, they are more affected. <sep><sep> There is also a reference to Singapore, the most repressive and authoritarian country with a fascist government. <sep><sep> it is they who will decide whether or not to have a bona fide Industrial Court case for severance pay. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we say this to remind everyone that there is a great economic pressure for the USA to close its bases. <sep><sep> They are waiting for Electoral Reform, in whatever form, provided it addresses their single issue of standing as candidates without putting the community first. <sep><sep> What we are proposing strongly recommends ending the noisy mechanism of parents pushing their children in primary school who are not doing well, therefore improving the school. <sep><sep> So, what is it, this trend when people cast their vote? <sep><sep> The article predicts a strong opposition to the Obeegadoo plan and also predicts what the basis of this opposition will do. <sep><sep> Doctors, nurses, teachers, and students were forced to take over. <sep><sep> But in the National Economic Development Council, Ganga and his team thought that the social problems they faced were passing and that when rapid development filled the issues, they would disappear on their own. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, there is a need to address the issue: it is rather saying that the Government is delaying payment of Blue-Print in the context of the conflict between the Government and the establishment. <sep><sep> The creation of the State of Israel in an economic logic of imperialist colonization - when the British Empire took control of the Ottoman Empire (100 years ago) after the First World War (1914-18). <sep><sep> The IMF, in its Post-Election Report, predicts that it will be 2%. <sep><sep> We need to gradually move towards an economy that does not rely on sugar cane, we need alternative agriculture, and we need a large agro-industry for export. <sep><sep> Only Minister Soodhun who today finds that there are no more problems in the country, which means for him and the Alliance in which he is, unemployment is not a priority! <sep><sep> The government is also, and it is time this article, seriously considering the mentality of people based on the language they speak. <sep><sep> In their affidavit, they make it clear in writing that they do not totally support the Best Loser System issue, even if in their public political statements they state otherwise. <sep><sep> Our policy of support for the Palestinian cause has brought LALIT considerable support from the Mauritian people. <sep><sep> When you read the newspaper, you find that it is a perspective. <sep><sep> Yesterday, Auguste Follet also sent a message on behalf of his Federation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the report, it is said that a 17-year-old boy, Hamra, whose soldier was stopped in the middle of the night because they suspected him of being involved in an issue involving throwing stones at Israeli colonists near his school in the West Bank. <sep> <sep> Economic development, global level and national level determinants, and this in 2008 proved to be interesting. <sep> <sep> There is also another gas that causes an unbearable sound to disperse people. <sep> <sep> Without wasting time, the mission was accomplished. <sep> <sep> Martin Luther King often tells them to admit their mistakes, ask for forgiveness, and take a new path. <sep> <sep> Alain Ahvee ended his intervention by underscoring the need for a united front that unites local and international workers, so a political party must be able to articulate the national law with the international law together. <sep> <sep> He has clearly experienced very important moments in his life during these 3 weeks. <sep> <sep> In Mauritius sometimes, they miss out on a lot of services, many laws and they often lose their lives, in the end, they end up fighting to get a better salary and they die in strikes, demonstrations, in repression, this is not something that happens automatically. <sep> <sep> It is the working class and the trade union movement that also have a mission to demand the replacement of the IRA law by a new law that will enable workers to develop the capacity to bring the true sanctions necessary today when the choice between barbarism and socialism is made. <sep> <sep> For a long time, what has happened is that this paper that you signed as if you had the right to Rs500,000, the bank uses this as an asset. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is important that we ally ourselves with the people of the US and UK in our fight against their Governments. <sep><sep> and the way in which the party has dealt with the Lalit youth group. <sep><sep> Interestingly, Balancy has 2 other aspects that do not concern Best Loser: <sep><sep> In the years 1979 and 1980, the worker class has shown its potential, when it started a movement of defiance, when it unified as a worker class, its capacity to mobilize the masses, where other suppressed groups joined in. <sep><sep>PMT, we do not know what happened, but now we have the Premier Movement (MPM) <sep><sep> He thought that this was just a fashion among the youth. <sep><sep> One meaning! He was coming to the end of his second term. <sep><sep> According to his own memory, from what he heard, read, saw, he was a link that produced a ideology contrarian to the dominant ideology. <sep><sep> So, like Rada said, this question of nationalism, this nationalist agenda, is a bourgeois agenda. <sep><sep> The government is certainly heading in the same direction, that is to strengthen worker-class amidst economic crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And the government, acting as if becoming more monarchical? <sep><sep> But with increased salaries, as you may have guessed, the capitalist system will continue to reign. <sep><sep> All different governments have been and are still continuing to protect and support established business owners and other sectors tied with financial security. <sep><sep> But paradoxically, what Diego found in Paloma is exactly what he will do everything to change. <sep><sep> The state must use the means it already has: when granting a permit for a windmill farm, it should impose conditions that the establishment transforms its infrastructure for a different kind of agricultural transformation. <sep><sep> Before his visit, he stated that he was not even aware that it was a checkpoint because it has never been mentioned in the media. <sep><sep> There is also the work of Emmanuel Richon on French and Creole language dictionaries, and this dictionary dates back to the birth of the Creole language. <sep><sep> Members noted that with the launch of the book and CD on the Manifesto by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. <sep><sep> The small capitalists are being replaced by multinational companies like WAY and GAME. <sep><sep> When the government talks about its 10-year plan to accelerate the Security Industry, what it is actually saying is that it is accelerating the destruction of workspaces. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Regarding the "Tea Party" in the Other World, we haven't found anything like that in the Other World for a long time. <sep><sep> This sanction (meaning when we go further with reading our own language) will bring us to develop a new relationship with our language, a more intimate, more formal, yet more rational rapport with the Kreol language. <sep><sep> The authentic Mauritians and other residents of Mauritius who were usually considered immigrants. <sep><sep> They are not a political organization with a program, but only proposing solutions. <sep><sep> Firstly, in the development of this political program, there was an in-depth analysis that has not been carried out in any Ministry. <sep><sep> Eric Guimbeau has had a varied political career. <sep><sep> Could allowing an indescribable disorder (with violence, and with sharing the pain) continue in prison? <sep><sep> Compared to the importation figures for 2011, that is Rs18 billion, 5 years later. <sep><sep> Some are losing their homes, land, everything, because of the bank's heavy debt burden. <sep><sep> Shouldn't we be considering a labor strategy for Mauritians to face capitalist globalization? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> They have had to allow enough nationalization, enough welfare state, especially in the world. <sep><sep> There was a debate on how to popularize the demand for a strong government to diversify establishments, because people with land do not all want to grow food, and people who want to grow food do not all have land. <sep><sep> They do not criticize either Labour or PMSD on the fundamentals. <sep><sep> In the years following the 2004/2005 budget speech, LALIT publicly took a stand to denounce the decision of the MMM/MSM government to abolish the universal subsidy for exam fees and introduce targeting. <sep><sep> Any individual with the power to obstruct the natural expression of a group of people risks genocide. <sep><sep> Its crisis stems from a problem of speculation on property prices above its value, a "bubble" or "bubble". <sep><sep> Then, it is not clear why the press has never been too interested in this. <sep><sep> The lack of action is rather to calm and even paralyze the popular mobilization against Israel. <sep><sep> The position of the Mauritian state has marked a significant qualitative evolution: a separation between sovereignty issues. <sep><sep> LALIT has also questioned their definition of what constitutes a person in "employment". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is important is that it is at the discretion of the employer to give you a place and a name. <sep> <sep> Many of these people eventually joined the MMM and PT afterwards. <sep> <sep> For example, if today someone wants to start a union, and they want to call it the Mauritius Painter's Association, they are not entitled. <sep> <sep> He recounted some of the major problems that are allowing the State of Israel's military occupation to continue, which is that people around the world are not aware of the situation of those living under occupation. <sep> <sep> For the future, for the future generations, for our security, for the security of our soil, we need to move towards renewable energy. <sep> <sep> The way that the crisis of the past was dealt with was to recruit all young men into the army for a government salary, and camps were established as dormitories for the company: <sep> <sep> Immediately after, Ashok Subron announced that he would abstain from this motion, but he assured that he would respect the members' decision, and he would also participate in the work of the commission on youth employment issues. <sep> <sep> For the municipal and village elections in December 2012, the Electoral Commission for the first time included notices in Creole as well as in other languages. <sep> <sep> In the LALIT program, we include demands on social issues, as well as economic ones. <sep> <sep> It is based on this type of knowledge that some family businesses have started producing confectionery, jams, canned fruit, crystallized fruits, spices, sometimes on a semi-industrial basis: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we, as members of LALIT, have to deal with this bureaucracy. <sep> <sep> Vote for LALIT so that there is more democracy and freedom. <sep> <sep> You would also find that there is a new political course that should emerge through LALIT, a party that has a clear and transparent program, which has not engaged in electoral fraud. <sep> <sep> The Prime Minister is not addressing the real issue, he is allowing Boolell to spread rumors. <sep> <sep> Since 1995, the Court is programmed to disappear. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, where the opposition, the MMM/MSM Breakup process has also gone through periods of instability. <sep> <sep> But with this kind of variation, we can say that there are different forms of bourgeois State, and I will mention only 2 of them: Bonapartist State, and Fascist State. <sep> <sep> "LALIT was already at the forefront of this position in the Lalit Review no. 74, April 1990 and Lalit Review no. 79, November 1990". <sep> <sep> Excerpts from John Bellamy Foster's The Ecological Rift uploaded in "Documents" (in Mauritian Creole). <sep> <sep> This interference is dangerous because if it is adopted by a large part of the population, it can lead to the gradual erosion of the Creole language without us realizing it, until everyone adopts connotations that are different from another language and lose its own specific connotations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we arrive at the end of the Marse protection march for the 2007 sugar regime, just as when we arrived at the end of the Milti-Fib Lagoon regime, they were "Chronicles of an announced crisis". <sep><sep> The MLF also asked Minister Seebun to popularize these Rape Crisis Units so that all women know that if they are ever violated, they do not need to go to the police station, they can go directly to the hospital. <sep><sep> In rare photos of the demonstrations during the '79 Ut strike movement and the '80 Septam mobilization, you will find his photo. <sep><sep> And this "voir dire" makes it clear that there is a conflict with this lawyer at all levels in the police force, up to the highest bosses. <sep><sep> The workers he represents have the same interests: those with better working conditions, greater job security, and improved pay. <sep><sep> He says that for him, it was interesting to see how people mobilize and organize. <sep><sep> Or does it correspond to the foreign policy of the Zini State? <sep><sep> But we also need to be aware of the limitations of this legal strategy, the limitations of legalism. <sep><sep> In terms of politics, we need to explain why and how Navin Ramgoolam and his Labour Party have been making so much effort for such disparate things in the past 10 years. <sep><sep> At the same time, elsewhere, in the Samarel forest, Gopal, a dobby, and his wife, Gianee, were heading to wash clothes in the river. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A confession is only valid if the accused confirms it in front of the magistrate. <sep> <sep> We sometimes forget problems, clear our minds, and recharge in new activities. <sep> <sep> But, this concept is not clear in his mind. <sep> <sep> The first definition is that it is a country with borders, a space, and a democracy that is only, transparent, unique towards its citizens. <sep> <sep> Since this LANGUAGE PROGRAM started circulating, it has become very popular. <sep> <sep> The RA continues to push for their rights on the land without classification. <sep> <sep> Some people are beginning to rise against communalism in the constitution. <sep> <sep> Elsewhere, the company that had pushed Tamby aside under political pressure not only took him back but also gave him a promotion. <sep> <sep> The longer, the more real this phenomenon we are describing becomes. <sep> <sep> there is this foundation of mother tongue so that children can learn in a way that does not hinder the development of their cognitive capacity and also learn other languages well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mr. Pakeeree, a worker from Suriname, has recently taken a public position to denounce the law that led to the death of his wife. <sep><sep> Therefore, for some time there has been talk of creating a 5th International. <sep><sep> So they are saying that the separation of work and ownership should not be pushed too far. <sep><sep> In the French zone sector, there have been a series of laying offs for several years and a large number of workers have not received any compensation. <sep><sep> It is a significant investment and a guarantee against poverty at the same time. <sep><sep> When you put all this together, you will find that the force that made it possible for this bill to pass. <sep><sep> And there is a political price to pay for this kind of work. <sep><sep> Other children would have been sleeping meaning everything would be normal. <sep><sep> Among the testimonials there were also very relevant questions. <sep><sep> And then it gives the capitalist system a little breather. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, a systemic crisis has occurred in the global economy overall. <sep> When the media and even ourselves, the electorate, the people, we do not find the reality in front, we do not find it as it is, it's a way to simply say that it corrupts us too. <sep> By studying police violence against detainees, studying it in practice during this struggle that we are leading to counteract it, we have understood the state much better than before. <sep> Diego Garcia has been chosen as 4th priority for NO US BASES. <sep> Even the names that they gave the children (Ram, Shakti, Koy-Koy) were like a serious provocation mainly for the Euro-Creole conservatives who were more scared and despised it more than any other. <sep> The Uttermost Uver to Prime Minister Ramgoolam and Minister of Foreign Affairs Boolell. The Prime Minister, The Minister of Foreign Affairs. <sep> For World Literacy Day (September 8) Education for Workers will launch a new course. <sep> Instead of proposing measures only to appease employers in the Textile and Clothing Industry temporarily, does the Government not have a responsibility for the future of working class, for the coming generation? <sep> It doesn't even have its share of work that it has stopped doing. <sep> But, in Ut 79, it was what we call a "degreving movement". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this is happening in a context where there is an economic and political crisis. <sep><sep> The marchers have decided to sit on the symbol in protest and have said they will not move until the three trade union marchers have passed. <sep><sep> This is a difference between us and the other parties. <sep><sep> Mrs. Savriacooty, unfortunately, is not the only victim of this double trauma. <sep><sep> But, it's not true because it's not possible for there to be a thing called a "clean innocent" because if it was "clean", it should reflect, exactly what work is being done! <sep><sep> Three Sadou and Princess Prathna had to spend a period in Bannwas. <sep><sep> The worker had worked for 6 months continuously with the same employer to get it. <sep><sep> But all these changes were aimed at maintaining the profitability of the Security Companies, that is to say "establishments": separation of production and plantation areas; reclamation, conversion and cultivation of agricultural land; <sep><sep> Then, well! Binod Bacha came to the Company Garden meeting, and well! in 1982, for some reason, Bérenger went to England, and the Chagossians got compensation. <sep><sep> The contribution of Imam Ramesh Khaytoo conceptualized and organized a strike in 1970, and another way found, conceptualized. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and the organization believes in opposing the capitalist system, which conflicts with the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Yousouf Mohamed, Raouf Gulbul, Gaetan Jacquette, Jimmy Jean Louis, Philip Fanchette, Pramila Patten, Me. <sep><sep> Freedom March against Miray Aparteid to cover a distance of 200 kilomet. <sep><sep> From March 5 to 9, 2007, in Ecuador in Latin America, for the first time, a dozen organizations, including Lalit, which militates against military bases, are coming together for a global conference and demonstration against the American military base in Manta. <sep><sep> 2 of them are having difficulty maintaining their level of employment, and the 3rd is showing its fragility. <sep><sep> He recently and without being requested, granted an interview with Jean-Claude Antoine in the competing newspaper,  Week-End, for May 10, 2009. <sep><sep> After 20-30 years of globalisation, Burzwazi Deta has found that all its yellow checks have fallen under its control to build its own empire, and has become illegal. <sep><sep> This has actually worsened since the recession has started. <sep><sep> This means that either you are hiding, or you are trying to stifle the class struggle, especially the disappearance of people in the oppressed class. <sep><sep> We continued to attend the OWC conferences in 1995, 2000. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means we have a child, who is a little cold. <sep> <sep> We can imagine how much effort it takes for this teacher to use a dynamic approach for more class equality when the mother tongue of the working class is fully recognized. <sep> <sep> There were many workers present, despite the organizers, CTSP, saying, "MMM did not invite". <sep> <sep> In any case, only the saints are not enough to resist the temptation of Light-Blessing. <sep> <sep> To answer how important political struggle has become for me, it is partly because I grew up in joy, a symbol of MMM when there was still hope for radical change. <sep> <sep> They have proceeded to the total resignation of the most expensive ecological civilizations in all the oceans of the whole world with nuclear pollution. <sep> <sep> All the people in the bus are ordinary people who are going to work, seeing a doctor, a family, making a move to another neighborhood, and young people going to university. <sep> <sep> In the world, there are many, many more people who "do not have" a country than the people who "have" a country. <sep> <sep> However, in the last 30 years, productivity has increased a lot. <sep> <sep> This reflects people's concerns not only in this constituency, but especially in the country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But when those dangerous subversive times ended, peace was restored. <sep><sep> At that time, there were 2 friends here, like Yannick, like Kisna, who went to Venezuela and Cuba, to witness the social revolutions happening in those countries. <sep><sep> And stepping into the shoes (and socks) of PMSD and playing the role that PMSD had vis-a-vis imperialism. <sep><sep> ICT - In this sector, there are multinational companies, as well as state bourgeoisie like Jean Suzanne. <sep><sep> They propose things like "values" as advertisements. <sep><sep> 27% of our territory consists of houses and buildings, urban areas; <sep><sep> We need to demand policies like "We need to return with the Central Bank to reduce the rupee depreciation" so that we can prevent these capitalists from securing a low rupee price just to increase their profits. <sep><sep> The comprador bourgeoisie has no obligation to the sovereignty of the country and the well-being of the people of Mauritius - it is their profits and immediate interests that take precedence. <sep><sep> *Regarding the Artist: The Nitin Chinien concert brought together a constellation of artists who took a stand against police violence. <sep><sep> which means that it is the responsibility of this company that is to sell something to the public to clarify beforehand to prove that it will not have any harmful effects on a user nature. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, the reality that workers face is pushing the concept of class struggle to the forefront. <sep> <sep> You're spending energy to nourish your body, to gain nutrition, because without food, you die. <sep> <sep> The enormity of this statement becomes clear when a child of any activity of a sympathizer of a party can influence members to resign. <sep> <sep> A member of the diaspora, when he calls for a demonstration in his former country, he won't be there, he won't. <sep> <sep> A new spiral of violence risks being triggered after Israel entered Bethlehem and killed a leader and 3 Palestinian activists. <sep> <sep> Working people in times of Crisis: Branch Curepipe: Series on the web (Construction, site work). <sep> <sep> Bacon says that man dominates nature "by understanding its internal logic". <sep> <sep> The sizes that were all included, how work branches into a necessity, because every week people understand politics enough to escape its political and economic significance. <sep> <sep> "Put everything in the "State" book, what it wrote is by people who are militants, with all their militant experience between reflection and their language and participation in organizational action. <sep> <sep> Singapore is such a dictator that it is the only country in the world that classifies its people by race in its identity card. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today the media is largely responsible for Israel's refusal to engage in any dialogue with the international community on all violations of human rights that its armed forces are committing against people in Palestine. <sep><sep> There used to be 50,000 workers in this industry, now there are only 5,000 workers. <sep><sep> So, whether it's about Mauritianism or what we will discuss after eating, that is nationalism, we are heading towards the debate on the edge of the river. <sep><sep> MMM doesn't have a vague program since they present our values. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Jugnauth announced this in his 2004-2005 Budget Speech. <sep><sep> First, we all know about this world financial crisis that erupted 2-3 years ago. <sep><sep> Until a certain period of time, apparently in these countries, there was a movement of workers physically, being killed, assassinated, imprisoned, and it started during the 2nd World War. <sep><sep> People already know about various types of plantations with all kinds of fruit trees and vegetables. <sep><sep> So this explains the importance of organizing workers, for example, in unions, in federations like GWF (General Workers Federation). <sep><sep> *Immediate retirement demand proposed by the MMM-MSM-PMSD-FTS-Green party Government. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in this letter, we would have been happy to propose that, while the State of Mauritius is publicly showing support (as the Palestinians have done). <sep><sep> For UASI, there was Antoine Chavreemootoo, who has passed away. <sep><sep> The Mauritian Government should maintain diplomatic relations with Israel until the occupation stops! Yes to Palestinian diplomatic representation in Mauritius! <sep><sep> When Sharonne Marla, a young woman from Mauritius was accused of illegal employment last year, we started with her family, with her mother. <sep><sep> However, in Mauritius, the LPR and other organizations and individuals have already shown that the Creole language is already equal. <sep><sep> So, it is clear to us that a lot of effort should be made for young people to follow courses, other courses, diplomas, degrees, so that they do not end up on the job market. <sep><sep> A political party just says "Vote for me, I will do this for you!" This happens when someone, an individual themselves through his organization, is a member of a trade union. <sep><sep> Now they are discussing compensation that the European Union will pay for the food at prices: do not you think they will allow all compensation to go directly into the establishment's pocket? <sep><sep> Workers do not support the working class, and they say they are protecting you. MSM is similar. <sep><sep> Trade unionists are the heart of our party, and there are other young people in the branches. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bheenick Central Bank was most helpful during the rupee depreciation crisis. <sep> He couldn't have succeeded without an understanding wife. <sep> On an international level, it wasn't easy for him to organize this network, but we did it. <sep> He held on tight to his principles, followed his beliefs, and embraced his beliefs. <sep> They didn't form a political movement; they didn't have a manifesto; they were against leadership. <sep> With the health problem in 2013 and the consequences of this absence for the MMM, the Re-make, and the political landscape in general? <sep> Sometimes in partisan newspapers like Le Militant, there may be a special conspiracy to publish exaggerated and invented goals, a conspiracy that, unique to its nature, is meant to lead to an electoral advantage. <sep> Therefore, any type of work has become possible because of the progress we have made where we understand the nature of the state. <sep> He stated that yesterday, the community is defined according to the Constitution, defined according to a "way of life," and that people in Mauritius, over time, have developed a communal way of life. <sep> (1) Building enough houses to meet the demand and respect their promises. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he, his political strategy seems to revolve around creating confusion. <sep><sep> The more he attended meetings with the FTU, which, he also supported the strike in the Security Industry. <sep><sep> And then the social crisis that was triggered by the economic crisis, the only thing Navin Ramgoolam found to do is to propose the reintroduction of the death penalty. <sep><sep> LALIT has gained much solidarity from trade unions, from other organizations, and from individuals. <sep><sep> Ahmed Khan was born into a family that was active politically in underground organizations in Afghanistan, so he knows a lot about the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan. <sep><sep> There is a baby eagle that hatched in a nest. <sep><sep> And when Chagossians bring cases to Court in London, it has a positive impact on the licenses that the British press, the global press become aware of the problem. <sep><sep> You have Dev Virahsawmy who landed on the PT platform in 1982, you have a series of people from the MMMSP, like Dan Calikan he landed on the MSM platform in 1983. <sep><sep> There are journalists already here, because after the FRONT FOR PA BUSH meeting they are supposed to have a Press Conference from the same Front. <sep><sep> It's a way to keep your connection with the Palestinians until one day you can go back. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means for the first time introducing a new tax to pay the village. <sep><sep> Now they are entering the global market and Mauritius must be "competitive". <sep><sep> At that time, I remember, if someone comes to a meeting with a semilax, Paul Berenger puts him out. <sep><sep> Berenger then blamed Private Radio, threatened them and set up a Special Committee to control Private Radio. <sep><sep> No one had ever managed to know what the leaf was but never stopped, goats, and their children protested. <sep><sep> But, it was not a mobilization with a program and strategy, it was only big rallies against dictators. <sep><sep> People present made a call that when they explain, A4 must give practical examples of what is being explained and at the same time explain its theory. <sep><sep> There was also a Secretary's report by Alain Ah-Vee, at the Central Committee meeting and Political Bureau in rotation, major events such as Labor Day, International Congress in Ziyet, and Commemoration of 30 years of The 79 strike. <sep><sep> I'm not sure I need to check this Tuesday) 'Military Zone'. <sep><sep> "It represents a mortal danger to workers" Rajni Lallah said. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, even when we're at sea, to maintain the masquerade, they don't report it. <sep> <sep> According to the NHRC, under the law that was passed, it has the right to propose law sanctions, it has the right to critique the law. <sep> <sep> In return, the company or partnership receives income and profits either directly from the government, or through fees and tariffs imposed on these services. <sep> <sep> This is why the Labour Council, headed by Ashok Jugnauth, elected number 8 themselves. <sep> <sep> An apprentice in the sugar mill in Medine since the age of 14, because he sought workers' rights, he never received a promotion. <sep> <sep> Just like when workers in the French region lose their jobs, they will also receive a one-off payment so they do not protest in the Company Garden. <sep> <sep> What we call class struggle is not something that we decide to do or not to do. <sep> <sep> Then we were brought back to where the base is currently located. <sep> <sep> When the government decided to redo the municipal elections for 2006, it is doing as the Ptr did before. <sep> <sep> But, not everyone can set a price for your hard work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It represents a potential instability in the MSM-PT alliance today. <sep>
<sep> Even a key player like MCFI, which produces fertilizers and other agricultural products for Mauritius, has been affected. <sep>
<sep> It is important to note that the state does not represent the interests of every capitalist. <sep>
<sep> We used to sell Revi, sometimes 500 per month, sometimes 1,000, selling it in plastic bags for Rs2.00 each. <sep>
<sep> and promoting unconsciousness in spaces where there is paid advertising. <sep>
<sep> We need to specifically analyze and understand the mutations in the trade union movement. <sep>
<sep> We must take the lesson that the anti-lager movement needs to also become an anti-baz movement. <sep>
<sep> Because their government, the Australian Government, acting in an alliance with the Zini State Government on defense matters. <sep>
<sep> In all this, I lost; I lost my Farouk, the man who used to make me go wild with love. <sep>
<sep> However, it is only now that we understand exactly what the case was seeking, and exactly what the case has achieved. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And if you are interested in giving us a hand, contact us as well. <sep><sep> In part, it should have a constitution that organizes this internal democracy. <sep><sep> It does not advance that workers' rights must remove self-proclaimed dictatorships to take the direction of a union controlled and ruled by all kinds of tricks and manipulations. <sep><sep> There was a union asking for 45%, then 20%, because there are 5 different unions representing CNT workers and it does not seem that they have succeeded in sitting together to decide on a common demand. <sep><sep> He said that at the same time it is a challenge because traitors mean betrayal. <sep><sep> Kuran Deerpalsing-Sayed Hossen is also promoting capitalist implantation since Lazi, like the Tian Li company from Lasinn, Indian Oil, Labyer Lenn limestone, Malaysian companies in the energy sector. <sep><sep> So, in a sense, in a certain moment, in another society, a socialist society, through a distribution system, you can attack this alienation. <sep><sep> The Finance Minister has put a lot of effort into it, he has borrowed foreign exchange, increased the value of foreign exchange, decreased the value of the Rupee. <sep><sep> But with examples, there are compromises between different groups in confrontation and this leads to a unified community according to Gramsci. <sep><sep> Until MMM betrays the working class and becomes an advocate for the same capitalist class it said it would fight. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In different parts of the world, one after the other, nothing has been done to reduce dependence on capitalist economy, which is prevalent in this crisis today. <sep><sep> Life for families in refugee camps in Palestine is even more difficult. <sep><sep> The petition was also signed by a series of organizations and individuals around the world: from doctor and lawyer associations in Lagos. <sep><sep> Despite saying he didn't have any bitter feelings, those who knew him well were aware that Tim had kept a bad memory. <sep><sep> Although a small part of the DSD had done well in the municipal elections. <sep><sep> However, in every country where there is "capitalist reign," the bourgeoisie cannot easily manage constant instability so it seeks to align itself with other goals in other classes. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is no self-regulation in the press except for this Ethical Committee of L'Express. <sep><sep> Since the POTA law, the police seemed to believe they could arrest anyone, hold them incommunicado for 72 hours. <sep><sep> It is a socialist vision, represented largely by LALIT. <sep><sep> We have organized several petitions and even demonstrations in favor of mother tongue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was supposed to organize a large gathering of people to say no to criminals in politics, and for a new constitution. <sep><sep> We searched and still found no trace of Mauritius on any map. <sep><sep> Even on the issue of daily bread, it is not a matter of principle. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, many parties have been divided and emerged in the world, literally, in the most recent programs and in the most extensive parties. <sep><sep> As he lost the habit of walking or exercising, he quickly became tired. <sep><sep> Indeed, London, Brazil, and even the US are not spared by what is happening and what will happen in Europe. <sep><sep> In many places, they discovered since what distant people were using. <sep><sep> Their only concern is to pull down Navin Ramgoolam since his removal as Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Ramesh contributed his creativity to the electoral campaign too. <sep><sep> In 2004 LALIT and GRC sent a Delegation to the World Social Forum in Mumbai, and we were planning the PEACE FLOTILLA project that had so much support in many parts of the world, together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He presented a bilingual book with illustrations for use in preschool. <sep><sep> And he may decide to give only 1 or 2 months of service per year. <sep><sep> When Diego, real Langleter, Paloma, and he decided to test the strength of their love. <sep><sep> So this "volunteer" retreat which is supposed to have, is rather a compulsory retreat. <sep><sep> We brought this bed without lying, without using any subterfuge. <sep><sep> These Saints have been described by many international observers as concentrations of where weapons are committing all kinds of atrocities. <sep><sep> Two months after his death, Tears, pieces that inspired an article in Class Lalit No. 6, was re-edited. <sep><sep> Lalit is calling on all workers, farmers, youth, and women to start mobilizing. <sep><sep> Not only have we succeeded, but we have always warned people about the repressive State, instead of glorifying it. <sep><sep> Our proposals that we have prepared on time are based on the campaigns we have conducted on the lack of democracy in the electoral system, and on proposals that we have developed more precisely in a series of 6 meetings or through participation of activists from other democratic organizations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A program we can make it very beautiful, but if there is no force behind the program, the program remains just a paper. <sep><sep> Some unions are national unions, by profession, some unions are unions for all professions but by the company. <sep><sep> How many people in the world today detest militarism Bush, symbolized by the naval base on Diego? <sep><sep> Do you understand his global imperialism, his militarism, his crises, his financial capital kingdom, its internal contradictions. <sep><sep> We look at the economy and economic turmoil, we follow the IRS and dependent national tourism as well as how it affects our heritage. <sep><sep> If a football team puts 10 people alongside its goalie between the two posts, to prevent the ball from going in. <sep><sep> Lome and Cotonou conventions no longer protect production in countries like Mauritius. <sep><sep> Even if we mobilize people, even if we hold a demonstration with 100,000 people, it's worth only what it's worth. <sep><sep> With regard to the new definition of the President of the Republic as a "guarantor" of democratic rights, it is simply a disguise for the constitutional manipulation that MSM/MMM are bringing about. <sep><sep> If we believe in our program and our strategy, then we must fulfill our duty to give ourselves the means to make it a reality, and for that, we have to frame it, we have to improve the framework, and we have to recruit new frames. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The hospital staff has access to their own medical records. <sep> <sep> We have analysis articles that we write, news, documents, audio messages, photos. <sep> <sep> In towns and villages, they were constructing their tally and there they were selling their goods. <sep> <sep> There should be pensions and other social and economic rights on a universal basis and not on a means-testing or targeting basis. <sep> <sep> Because it is a Government that knows what class it represents. <sep> <sep> An idea is to work on the translation of labor laws and serve this translation for workers' benefits, create a literary revolution in different sectors, create small reflection groups on labor issues. <sep> <sep> The council reads everyone's story "Teddy Rant in District Council" to know how this exercise will strengthen the election process. <sep> <sep> Waiting for metal or may, cocoa for this year. <sep> <sep> However, in LALIT, we do not agree that Mauritius should go towards eating animals (as is already happening in Africa, the Caribbean, Asia) when there is a land that can be used for agricultural cultivation. <sep> <sep> It is interesting to note that G. Duval said that for him, Berenger is his true political heir more than Xavier Duval. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that Israeli military planes have bombarded a village in Gaza. <sep><sep> After the result, Berenger's immediate reaction is that there should not be a communal reaction to this result. <sep><sep> There is a lot of communalism among the youth, and it is amplified by social networks. <sep><sep> The reason why we have stood up strongly to denounce the British for their hypocritical attitude, for their attitude that does not merit any consideration. <sep><sep> And we are in a time where social class issues, class struggle, is not like a game, like it used to be in the '70s-'80s, right? <sep><sep> It will be a society where everyone contributes, everyone participates in all decisions: what to produce, where to invest. <sep><sep> Does this explain Navin Ramgoolam's position, who is in favor of delaying the penny voting today, even if before he was against it? <sep><sep> But it's never too late for good development. <sep><sep> Organizers have said that even though they wish for as many people as possible to participate, the limited seats at Teat Port-Louis, so you have to get your ticket early. <sep><sep> He invites you to a meeting, he gives you a pat on the shoulder, he can offer you food and drink. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ramgoolam has been removed from his staff position for a few years now without the Labor Party or his government following up until now. <sep><sep> So, it is not surprising that the workers have become disillusioned with the unions, and other forces that pretend to be right and just, in all kinds of logic in the Historical Bloc that the Labor Party is promoting. <sep><sep> He will also expose his own personal problems. <sep><sep> It is extraordinary that he could be held accountable at a time when the Legislative Government needs to select a side whether it will continue to collaborate with the policies of the American and Israeli Governments or if it will take a stand for a free Palestine and Gaza. <sep><sep> Then it is the public that will pay for the service at the same time that the company/consortium will profit. <sep><sep> This means that Mauritians are eating less nourishing food compared to 5 years ago. <sep><sep> In fact, the finality of bureaucracy: so that it is not necessary for the working class to participate in meetings, in discussions, it only becomes active when called upon, using its time-off that the law gives it, and only to renew the bureaucracy class each year. <sep><sep> It transfers a useful matter into a money matter. <sep><sep> Now, it is evident that the former President Cassam Uteem had said in a speech that seemed completely reasonable. <sep><sep> Starting in 1987, many of us were involved in the workers’ movement DWC, which later formed the CAWU union and affiliated with the GWF. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In our first year of existence, a group of elders who helped us gain clarity on this issue, is when we put our heads together to imagine and create a manifesto, where we reflect on what demands we need to make for women's emancipation. <sep><sep> Sometimes it is a movement where its ideology is "anti" Franco-Mauritian, sometimes it has quite a negative connection with the Franco-Mauritian bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Port Louis in 4-5 different rooms, Curepipe L’Hotel de Ville, and in a series of villages: Surinam, Bambous, Rivyer Nwar, Pamplemousses, Mahebourg. So, Ramesh indeed, upon close inspection, is a well-known figure. <sep><sep> And it is for this reason that I say that the 79 UPR strike was a challenge to the bourgeois lord. <sep><sep> - Large planters (as well as other bourgeois elements of the state) who have more than 50 arpents of land become shareholders in the new cluster and benefit from the monopoly profits in ethanol and electricity production. <sep><sep> We asked Lindsey how her time was at the university and what she learned. <sep><sep> Many people congratulate LALIT members for their “beautiful Creole,” they speak on the radio and at meetings. <sep><sep> They do not know that at the same time, they can use it as a medium only for those who intellectually and linguistically find my formulations challenging, such as music, PE, etc. <sep><sep> the displacement resulting from a military occupation of the Republic of Mauritius by the USA, the daily violence tolerated by patriarchal hierarchies - in the name of a single cause - is an unfortunate problem. <sep><sep> When the courage to work becomes something that can be bought and sold, the worker, for a day or a week, will have a salary. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The speech hints at an ideological orientation of the government. <sep><sep> In this speech, it explains how the upper class worker's campaign and position finally took note of the West European aspirations. To prevent a major goal of the Anglo-European Cross-Assistance from engaging in a crusade to promote slavery in other Atlantic regions. <sep><sep> In Tel Aviv, I am waiting for a bus to go to Hares. <sep><sep> There is also a JEC/MEF division that is scheduled to take place in April. <sep><sep> It can only exist within a political alliance, at least have proportional representation, or a split-3. <sep><sep> Often, if a worker wants to mark a location, wants to make a transaction, or has something to do, many times the employer can say, "no." <sep><sep> Additionally, the US embassy is involved in various social activities such as adopting entire villages and sponsoring artists. <sep><sep> Because when employers cannot feel the 2 of them until now, we, we have to be a bit like workers, when we are not so sure why. <sep><sep> Even with 5% more tourists, as you fill other hotels, it is less than necessary. <sep><sep> we do not see anyone as a different size, we do not see anyone in an isolated way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So when the elections come, the only way the Working Class could find to dilute MMM's vote was to support certain demands that LALIT had developed during its 5-year campaign. <sep><sep> For the past 2 years, they have committed themselves to increasing their wages by 80% of their salary at a fixed rate of $104. <sep><sep> We have about 400 unions registered, and they are in 20-30 different Federations, and these Federations are grouped in a Confederation (6-7). <sep><sep> And I remember that there was interest from the French in the water, and now the Singaporeans are interested in the water. <sep><sep> Carol Benson said that when using the mother tongue for only 2-3 years, the benefits are lost when changing to a foreign medium before sufficiently developing cognitive terms (which takes 12 years from birth). <sep><sep> Marxist analysis of the economy includes a political will, a collective action (more precisely conscious past action, conscious present action, conscious future action). <sep><sep> or encourage everyone to go on a radical salary allocation, which means only one thing: all this will have the effect of reducing job security. <sep><sep> This is a very effective way to check the State. <sep><sep> Every day, the newspapers interviewed an MMM-MSM and an L'Alliance Sociale, either reporting a meeting everywhere or reporting a press conference everywhere. <sep><sep> And they were getting nice rewards for the support they were giving to 'progressive and prosperous architects. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When a capitalist system enters a crisis period like now, there are only 2 possibilities. <sep> In the first way, the media becomes a "bourgeois" media because every newspaper or private radio, it is a private company whose main goal is to make money for their investors, who have put their capital into it. <sep> It is possible now for the Mauritian government to write to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to request an inspection. <sep> Ram Seegobin was beginning to say that 2012 was a year of many events, with many sanctions. <sep> At that time, just before Independence, it was difficult for a new bourgeoisie to emerge, with the rights of man increasing and democracy beginning to take over from autocracy. <sep> The government should change the name and duties of the "Sugar Insurance Fund Board" to the "Agricultural Insurance Fund Board" to make it easier for all planters to have insurance against cyclones and disasters. <sep> In Italy, it was worse: a boss who had quite serious personal problems, he owned TV channels that specialized in very controversial programs against women, and then he became a dictator. <sep> -Unemployment is continuing to rise. Employers are relocating, merging, going bankrupt. <sep> At only 5'3" tall, he is wearing a large badge on his jacket. <sep> How can they make people believe there is a new product or a new brand on the market, or give factual details about what they are selling. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the weekend, a card that has been reproduced is found, it is written, "Race: Javanese". <sep><sep> In the case of the investigation into the death of Vanessa Lagesse, not only Bernard Maigrot and witness Martine Desmarais who suffered brutality, but also the mother and husband of Vanessa Lagesse, three lawyers and a doctor. <sep><sep> Forget your drumming! Gather your sheep! The rain has soaked the toad. <sep><sep> They prefer to conspire with those who commit torture. <sep><sep> This was the time of intervention by Lindsey Collen, when she made an open speech for the LALIT conference on 1 and 2 November 2011. <sep><sep> Today, we are finding various Ministers coming up with this as a solution to unemployment. <sep><sep> The second great Quran has arrived, but truly, he is among the people who ecology blames for destroying the earth, Francis Bacon, a great rationalist scientist of the 17th century, who somewhat resembles the father of modern scientific methods. <sep><sep> Or when Ministers intervene in religious, social platforms, while they have connections to a particular community, because it is poorly implemented. <sep><sep> If the Chinese government continues with this nationalization (which it does not call "nationalization", obviously!) we will have a new form of "state capitalism" that we have never imagined before. <sep><sep> What is important here, is to see how the recovery of the truth for the emancipation by status: the demand for equality has been interpreted by the media and the State as a demand for women to rise in the patriarchal hierarchy! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will reduce the dependency on fossil fuels: coal, diesel and gasoline. <sep> <sep> We have been and are continuing to act to ensure that this issue does not disappear from the agenda. <sep> <sep> This work allows him to earn a decent living for his family for a year, sometimes he has enough to share with his friends. <sep> <sep> They were just a group of young people interested in Ecology, anti-slavery or anti-globalization issues that we are raising. <sep> <sep> The average family income in Mauritius is less than Rs 11,000 per month, for the whole family. <sep> <sep> When it comes to "selling his heart", some say, "He no longer works because his heart is gone, he is old, he is time to retire". <sep> <sep> Neill, Maria Montessori, Celestin Freinet and Paulo Freire who for many years have been working to develop an alternative pedagogy where learning becomes a pleasure, where creativity is developed and where emancipation and liberation are fostered. <sep> <sep> They did not have the right to speak of a "working class", but rather of a "working middle class". <sep> <sep> Papa and Brother Jamouna were very happy with Dass who spent all his time with them, in other words, he was becoming more of a brother and sister rather than their own brother. <sep> <sep> Neville Alexander came to Congress, and LALIT had a formal meeting with him when he was there. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>* Does such a program bring us in the right direction, does it create good dynamics? <sep><sep> In addition to its own strength, the MMM has aligned itself with L’Organisation Fraternelle, it has generously given member tickets OF, and aligned itself with Kishore Mundil in KMLI. <sep><sep> We are saying that we shouldn't just diversify agriculture (organized plantations to link them to all sectors, for example), but above all, we need to organize agro-industry as well, for it to be there, besides. <sep><sep> Often you hear what you thought we were thinking. <sep><sep> But, on the other hand, you are going into demands that, among political terms, we will call fascist. <sep><sep> Change the role of all Central Committee members to take a turn in the Political Bureau that can go up to 6 months. <sep><sep> Here, Ram Seegobin showed me the color-coded map of Moris where the schools are located. <sep><sep> But Stalin, when he executed Bhukarin, in 1930, he actually simultaneously phy¬sically killed him, killing the ideological corners of Marxism: Stalin decreed an "ecological theory". <sep><sep> When reason and discipline resonate with the country, and there has even been a form of "market protection" since 1815, Here, Patrick Niveling claims his conspiracy, Wednesday 14 Novam 6:00 on Horl - on 1825 - 2005. <sep><sep> With reason, everyone thought we were going to use the electoral reform only after the MSM left the Government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have also circled a light on all the 22 organizations that were part of Platform Pa Bush and other individuals. <sep> <sep> It was mentioned how we are not tired after the campaign because it inspired, according to our sources, in our scope, and in our own way. <sep> <sep> In the context of the economic crisis and the inability of the union to respond to this crisis, MLF is noting a new awareness and willingness where women workers are advancing more to reflect, organize, and act as workers. <sep> <sep> Will it be like in 1996 and 2000 when it was announced that it would be? <sep> <sep> We will need to look in detail at the evolution of the PTr because history will give us an idea of how it emerged from a socialist, trade union party in 1935, how it evolved into becoming a bourgeois party. <sep> <sep> Now, Diego is seen as one of the secret places where the U.S army tortures prisoners. <sep> <sep> 125 people gathered in Gran River North West, Port Louis, in Orl LPT, to hear speeches, messages, and appreciate cultural morsels in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, in a moment of reflection and dialogue. <sep> <sep> Falafel, a pita dip with 3 cakes that are somewhat like butter cakes but made with palm oil instead of lentils. <sep> <sep> In the PT itself, there are people like Patrick Asseervaden, Shakeel Mohamed, Arvind Boolell who said there should be a new communal census. <sep> <sep> Here again, it is not only the size of the crossroads of different ideologies, but it is also at the level of the crossroads that the fracture of ideologies occurs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>  The retrograde of laws even when compared to the Labour Act and the Industrial Relations Act (IRA). <sep><sep> The trade union (Israeli lottery) does not put down roots, they slow down at the second line, they raise their hands with weapons, they continue their journey. <sep><sep> This means that Dr. Surnam performed a post-mortem against another post-mortem. <sep><sep>  Finance Minister Duval had to revise his growth projection for 2013 from 4% to bring it down to 3%. <sep><sep> He found a moment to publicly announce that he is accustomed to meeting with unions like "Jack Bizlall whom I saw on May 1" and to refer by name to Jayen Cuttaree, despite the existence of other bourgeois sections that are growing. <sep><sep> Employers and the Government have the right to go on strike and the law to create disorder. <sep><sep> This issue was raised in Parliament for the first time through a Motion in 1977 by the Honorable Azize Asgarally in 1977. <sep><sep> The girls, who were given the name "Angels of Deir Istya", introduced me to music and Arabic dance. <sep><sep> After a formal session, a very relaxed informal session took place under the cool shade behind Orl, until it was time for dinner. <sep><sep> Wednesday night, April 3rd 6th at 9:30, Dr. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to his Prime Minister, Jean-Claude, the situation clearly shows his eating habits. <sep><sep> Later in the paper, we see how the bourgeoisie's riches are slowly stabilizing. <sep><sep> There were even a few signs of possible development in the slave trade, rather than just giving in to laziness. <sep><sep> The Code Pink organiser has just received a new message from the embassy, they are so overwhelmed that they don't know how to deal with this wave of protests. <sep><sep> So, what is important for unity, is a program where all workers agree. <sep><sep> Volim, on the other hand, was working on what Marx had finally finished, finding it published when he was still alive. <sep><sep> In order to put an end to dictatorships faster, all States must stop military dictatorships in Burma, including Laos, Russia, and Iran; <sep><sep> We have refused to resign, as electoral reform cannot be seen without a functioning system at the same time. <sep><sep> The national party we found in 1976 has completely disappeared. <sep><sep> Or constitutional amendments for a 2nd republic, none of these will truly deepen democracy, they will not change the nature of power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 1982, thousands of people are protesting without fear of the police, 5,000 to 10,000 people are demanding the repeal of the Best Loser System. <sep>
<sep> During a private conversation, a Lalit activist asked another Lalit activist to explain why he voted a certain way in the Assembly. <sep>
<sep> Among others, there was Pravind Jugnauth, a candidate of the MSM in Parsyel. <sep>
<sep> We need to develop an action program to integrate new members and sympathizers, on themes such as: <sep>
<sep> Comrade Bryan raised an interesting point when he mentioned the relationship. <sep>
<sep> But the POTA gives the police the power to arrest you, detain you, and stop you without a warrant. <sep>
<sep> Our main concern is the economic and social crisis affecting workers and poor people. <sep>
<sep> -Conflict between the Government and Mulen La Concorde, following an increase in the price of rice. <sep>
<sep> when there is a rise in neo-liberalism rhetoric. <sep>
<sep> We need to know how to organize in the countryside, in the neighborhood assemblies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Because it was so important that the Workers' Party was surviving because it had become a very pro-capitalist, very bourgeois party, and it was surviving on a communal conscience, and that was evident in the countryside. <sep><sep> Xavier Duval continues to talk about economic resilience for Mauritius, despite there being economic crises in the textile, BPO, and tourism sectors. <sep><sep> He is concerned, in all cases, with a recognition of the existence of a phenomenon called "hegemony", and the possibility of breaking that "hegemony". <sep><sep> They explained that as they completed their studies there, they assured themselves a job and Yannick and Kisna were very impressed by the youth activists in Kiba. <sep><sep> A 2009 SOFRES survey showed that more than 2/3 of people supported introducing Creole on an equal basis with English in Parliament. <sep><sep> The first speaker was Ram Seegobin who launched Some SIDS in the context of government bankruptcy and bosses in strategies for the economy. <sep><sep> There was a Workers' Party that was very open and a movement between the Bissoondoyal brothers who had a nationalist ideology based more on culture than on class struggle, and union struggles. <sep><sep> And in opposition, it makes a lot of demagoguery, but it has not even raised its voice against the closing of the Village Council and the abolition of village elections. <sep><sep> We need to do something else at the same time, for it to succeed. <sep><sep> Firstly, we have a certain "small business" meaning that some large companies had to close down. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We met 4 women from ISM in Tall Crossroads. <sep><sep> and we managed to find just one part of the solution to this problem. <sep><sep> But what does this Treaty give us and what does it mean? <sep><sep> When a class gains a greater share in production, the other gains less, and vice versa. <sep><sep> (Dev Virasawmy, who ran under the MMM banner in the partial elections of Triolet-Pamplemousses in 1970, then formed the MMMSP). <sep><sep> its sector of work and secondly to move out of the capitalist production logic, because trade unions operate within the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Indeed South Africa has several institutions that have started to address terminological issues in various fields such as; judiciary, legislative and educational. <sep><sep> -The Best Loser system is a corrupt communal electoral system; electoral reforms are still needed to eliminate it. <sep><sep> And today in Mauritius, we are facing a systemic economic and social crisis, so if you are looking for individual solutions, we won't get very far. <sep><sep> And what Alain, in the paper prepared together with Ram, has shown, is another things that could be of great interest. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, now they have agreed to make an announcement on the mirror. <sep><sep> We have the duty to do things that we sometimes do not understand, do things we do not agree with, and that we certainly are not "responsible" for. <sep><sep> The first group of countries, they only fought against dictatorships supported by the USA, as in Tunisia and Libya, where the government and regime have truly fallen. <sep><sep> His boy is making a fever, he says, "I'm going to put a cold compress on you." He goes, he arrives at the garden. <sep><sep> Although Paul Berenger and Navin Ramgoolam were just talking, the electoral reform issue has resurfaced. <sep><sep> In a flash he had three contraventions. <sep><sep> Through the presence, the participation, and donations from supporters of the conference; it will be a success. <sep><sep> Perhaps the film does not have much importance as a whole, but it is clear that Julie Taymor has no sensitivity to Trotsky. <sep><sep> On the mirror only on his forehead there was a large photo of the founders of the company Lasos and Lasos Co. <sep><sep> Message to women in the world: 'Support us in our work for a better life for all.' <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a DSP, also in Australia, which has declared itself in the Socialist Alliance. <sep><sep> This power, it is not only limited to government notes, but it also concerns taxation on companies or taxation on paper or machinery, for example. <sep><sep> We have realized the importance of linking all aspects of our campaign together - which makes it more politically influential and stronger. <sep><sep> and Bhojpuri are the two languages spoken by the majority of the population, not used in the Mauritian education system and the government is actively encouraging their use in all institutions. <sep><sep> It is in the midst of despair that true hope is born. <sep><sep> What kind of limit? If you end badly, you go into oblivion. <sep><sep> He said today the existence of the security industry is a question - a sector in which many people were working, and which has received a lot of love since its creation. <sep><sep> Then it will create a major imbalance, imbalances with other laws. <sep><sep> A question that is looking particularly at the selfish interests in this sector, strictly short-term interests, without considering whether it is in the interest of educating children. <sep><sep> They, those who are buying into it, are in another social class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a Maritime University where you learn to navigate ships, and there is also a university where they offer courses on all kinds of subjects. <sep><sep> If, for whatever reason, an employee finds it not useful, they must find a way out. <sep><sep> They criticize the Government about the real issues, but not the underlying problems. <sep><sep> If one can mobilize enough people behind their demands, election after election, progress can be made. <sep><sep> The IRS project aims to create 4 jobs per city, especially jobs such as household employees and gardeners. <sep><sep> So, it is clear that in reality it is impossible for Paloma to climb the social ladder in the soap opera. <sep><sep> However, when the decision was being made there were a few people working on the project, so immediately, when the decision was made. <sep><sep> When residents come together, they hold mini-meetings and distribute leaflets. <sep><sep> In other words, it exists based on the Check Off principle, where it defends workers' interests on site, but there is a limitation because prices must be negotiated that the worker sells their labor courageously. <sep><sep> At the LALIT level, since we have existed since 1982, with a quite remarkable consistency, we have a position and a strategy to tackle the best loser system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Lenin showed how a section (a goal) in this oppressed working class, he separated himself (constantly) from the working class mass. <sep><sep> Working-class people did not find it necessary to join a union because if there were 25 people in the union, the union would negotiate and if there were negotiations with the NRB, everyone would have the same. <sep><sep> What is even more Kafkaesque is when L.Collen showed solidarity with R.Seegobin when he heard wise men call his name and learned that there was also a pursuit against him. <sep><sep> All this is causing social crises, much despair and cynicism among people, especially among youth. <sep><sep> For this first session, we would have had certain advantages if we had broken into small groups, which was our plan, we would all have spoken even more. <sep><sep> He needs his independence even if he lives in your dependence. <sep><sep> Captain Rafi from DCO for the Salfit region is coordinating activities on the ground. <sep><sep> A problem that has arisen and that keeps arising. <sep><sep> The machine had been manipulated before the election to count votes in a predetermined way. <sep><sep> What role does Blair, as a European advisor, and England bring and seek to bring in the region? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Voters no longer vote for a program, but for something they believe they can get. <sep> But, it is not just an alliance between 2 parties, like Labour and MMM. <sep> Is there a plan to deal with this?" If there is no plan, it is a waste. <sep> As long as there is poverty, people need to find a decent way to feed their family. <sep> In the Budget, Lalit is making a series of budget proposals (We will put it on the website quickly). <sep> And especially the way we have managed to subdue Lindsey Collen for the past three months. <sep> Voters in Constituency Number 3 have never received a valid explanation as to why he resigned from his party, nor from the National Assembly. <sep> This, therefore, makes him less willing to participate in class. <sep> The words of the British Foreign Secretary, David Milliband, on the issue of sovereignty in Mauritius and the rights of the Chagossians. <sep> For example, with the new law proposed by the Government in 2-3 weeks, all duties in all sectors will disappear. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, I will start where someone submits an application to start working and then goes for an interview. <sep><sep> Ensuring affordable irrigation water, constructing canals, especially in Rodrigues. <sep><sep> It hasn't been lost due to VRS, labor disputes, legal issues, but due to communalism. <sep><sep> We need to mobilize to promote this alternative application: it's not just possible, but it has become essential today. <sep><sep> At the same time while the MMM-MSM Government has encouraged destruction through the middle of good agricultural land, through Le Bénitier, through IRS, through golf course construction. <sep><sep> Alain Ah Vee, who chaired the press conference, presented Rada Kistnasamy. <sep><sep> Apart from a handful of people looking for a new direction for Jericho, the majority of people in this country continue to drift along in their routines, in other words, despite setbacks, despite tensions and conflicts, God's special Jericho would still hold everyone in high regard. <sep><sep> and Lalit has reminded that the LPT has already demonstrated in many ways through the government's language politics, it is carrying out linguistic genocide in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948). <sep><sep> And it is essential that we can clearly see this paradox among us, because it is necessary for a deep understanding of police violence and the nature of the State. <sep><sep> Everyone agrees that his "glorious years" when MMM was in alliance with PSM Harish Boodhoo, they got 60-0, which means they had all 60 seats in Parliament. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he signed behind the other unionists in the degrev movement. <sep><sep> 5,000 artisans who will lose their jobs today, will tell them to work in the IT industry in Cybersiti? <sep><sep> The website was launched today on 28th October in the World Creole Language Day. <sep><sep> Therefore, he wants to say that big historical capitalists, who have more management experience since the era of slavery and colonization, must continue this "good" management. <sep><sep> The concept is becoming more widely used since the publication of the Brundtland Commission report in 1987 - which was formerly known as the World Commission on Environment and Development. <sep><sep> But in Mauritius, we have only had experience since 1999. <sep><sep> What happens with MSM and PMSD, they are not too interested. <sep><sep> Sometimes we have Residential Seminars for just women, sometimes just for youth. <sep><sep> But it is clear that they are saying that the State needs to finance this debt servicing by compensation money from the European Union. <sep><sep> He explained how LALIT has developed links with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It should not give orders to companies controlled by local bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> It has denounced all forms of power-sharing, without raising any questions about the economic and social policies of the Alliance Social Government. <sep><sep> What the MMM-MSM Government was doing was attacking the very foundation of the Welfare State. <sep><sep> Then, when these first 62 First past the Post were elected, the Electoral Commission was silent, and it allowed a number of voters on the basis of ethnicity and community. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, all bourgeois political parties such as MMM, MSM, Labour Party, as well as newspaper editors and commentators, chose to ignore the severity of the crisis that was already announced; <sep><sep> But the ideological concepts of productivity, entrepreneurial freedom, and profit earned even the loudest voices and paralyzed the mind. <sep><sep> No movement allowed after 8:00 pm except for exceptional cases with 3-4 soldiers present at the Checkpoints on rare occasions. <sep><sep> Our participation helped to develop new demands for legislation against "Wage Theft". <sep><sep> Despite different Mauritian Governments since 1968, if they have worked or spoken here, it has primarily been about sovereignty. <sep><sep> In the context of independence and the Republic, Lalit chose to initiate action aimed at continuing the process of decolonization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The electoral process has been showing a tendency to deteriorate, as everyone knows. <sep><sep> He said that he will do a round in the villages, given all the tension, he doesn't think it's necessary for us to come. <sep><sep> This means that a party can help to prepare when to change quickly. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Chagossians who, as we know, have been victims of a forced displacement, a forced displacement to make way for the base through the Chagos Refugees Group Sagos and Olivier Bancoult, they have had a series of cases in front of the British courts, which are concluding with a case in front of the European Court of Human Rights. <sep><sep> We prefer instead to seek and keep alive within the organizations of revolutionary workers, an organization that will normally resound as a minority as long as the level of class consciousness and revolutionary consciousness among workers is high. <sep><sep> So unionization, it varies greatly from sector to sector. <sep><sep> Later, a 3rd deputy of MSM resigned and joined the Government. <sep><sep> But all colleagues do not have "parity of esteem": they are not esteemed in the same way. <sep><sep> this means that there will be no difficulty for teachers to work with passion and enthusiasm. <sep><sep> Jean Yves Dick began by saying that LALIT's contribution to the development of the mother tongue, especially the Creole language, dates back to 1976, when a monthly publication was published and distributed. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Most people only order when they are not full, and until they are full, but the cassava-potato is available. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister is not helping, saying what he lacks to say but what everyone who listens to him speaks, maybe he is helping, "... <sep><sep> Everyone here is invited, we put our heads together, we make it a matter where everyone participates fully. <sep><sep> Otherwise a small class (like the class that holds capitals; what the Occupy calls the "1%") could not rule over this huge, vast majority that needs to work to live, also as long as it is succeeding, more than 200 years. <sep><sep> Limem that was called Timi once and that the name that came back should be sannfwala. <sep><sep> and meanwhile a new generation of extremely extremist youngsters often integrates into Israel who do not find this lenzistis and are giving weight to the extreme right forces in Israel? <sep><sep> They have no program to favor working with people over profits. <sep><sep> Their principle that makes you program, your mines, able to progress. <sep><sep> So, it was no longer that wild capitalism, free, and out of control. <sep><sep> How does one assign such a true difficulty where it finds it? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We found a squadron of police, some with batons or revolvers in front of the police station and in the police station. <sep><sep> You know, the recognition of the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), that's how it was. <sep><sep> Today, US military planes can take off from Diego to drop bombs on innocent people in Iraq, Afghanistan or Sudan. <sep><sep> But, as compared to today's nationalists, it qualified his "Mauritianism," his nationalism. <sep><sep> The Mauritian government has allowed private sectors in Mauritius to organize recruitment for people to work on the basis, allowing them to advertise in the newspapers, interview people, not just Chagossians, to work on this basis. <sep><sep> They are no longer oppressed, and they do not want to become oppressors. <sep><sep> The law is created either by a parliament or by a president, not by a dictator. <sep><sep> They become violent and want to rule and crush me. <sep><sep> Ally Hosenbokus has also given details about the program on which Lalit is campaigning during the election. <sep><sep> This is what represented internal elements that brought detachment from Chagos and allowed military base resistance in Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, today we have a strict part-time balance, that is regional, departmental, commissions. <sep> <sep> Finally, in October, Bérenger realized that he was in a dilemma, so he withdrew all his proposals. <sep> <sep> He described the daily life, economic activities, and the government that exist there in its most elemental form. <sep> <sep> A long article that makes you understand this CSR concept. <sep> <sep> Kolmataz's solution is not walking, and it won't walk. <sep> <sep> Then, after the world war has caused its destruction, the economy has returned because we need to rebuild. <sep> <sep> It will become a political part in the interest of the dominant class. <sep> <sep> where we need a little more help, then towards the Assembly, make a decision whether to continue the strike or not. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin concluded by saying that in general, the campaign went well, with the means we have. <sep> <sep> Among the plans, the Security Industry seems quite satisfied with Mr. Joel de Rosnay's plan, ensuring that 35% of energy production for the next 20 years is made from bagasse. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The “Advisory Opinion” that the ICJ will issue is of great political importance. <sep> because the working class was politically neglected for 2-3 generations without any experience. <sep> Funny…! - What happened? - They didn't offer you a ticket. <sep> PR, it is a mechanism to enlarge the Legislative branch vis-à-vis the Executive branch (i.e. vis-à-vis the Cabinet, PPS, etc.). <sep> In this sense, it is truly a separate class. <sep> 8. In MIE or in a Creole Unity, it was always asked for. <sep> On Saturday 10 June at 2:00 pm, Lalit organized a public Debate Forum at the House of Culture and Leisure in Arcades Sunassee, Rose-Hill on the question of Bidze Sithanen. <sep> He looked for everyone who could help him. <sep> And with a crime where a tourist lost his life, the reality of the hotel sector has been exposed. <sep> even the workers' class organizations were not realizing the seriousness, either they couldn't do anything or they didn't know how to react to the crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The reason they joined the demonstration is that they want a percentage of profits from the establishment. <sep><sep> But thankfully there is paternity leave, fathers now have the right to 5 days of paternity leave. <sep><sep> During this conference, many organizations in Mauritius have committed to a declaration to renew their support for the closure of the base in Diego. <sep><sep> The media was already in the hands of multinational companies; most 'big' journalists chose to stay on the sidelines. <sep><sep> This relentless pressure has allowed us to hold this Conference, and this Conference, why should it move forward? <sep><sep> At this level, there is already a first confirmed, important law. <sep><sep> An entire page dedicated to the MMM conference de pres, featuring photos of Berenger and his lieutenants. <sep><sep> The program speech was quite vague with a series of announcements and intentions to enhance the power of the President, proposals for a referendum, increasing the number of guards at the border. <sep><sep> Sometimes we may not criticize them enough, because people who don't closely follow may think they are the solution to everything. <sep><sep> However, they have become very focused on proposing a unique government, a "national welfare" government, a "rescue plan". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A mirror that is supposed to divide Palestine into several disconnected pieces. <sep><sep> As historical bourgeois exploitation, places where even today class groups can stand together. <sep><sep> Big capitalist companies, through advertising, gain control over the media in 3 ways: <sep><sep> and other local, national, and international movements supporting progress to meet and help build this global movement. <sep><sep> So, in November 1976 in LALIT CLASSES Review No. 1, a first publication in the LALIT tradition, we began to develop a class analysis. <sep><sep> Because remember when there is negotiation with the boss, when you are promoting a salary increase, the increase, they mean, you're promoting more profits. <sep><sep> This crisis situation, it is difficult for the bourgeoisie to bear, even if it has all the will in the world. <sep><sep> What is also necessary today is for workers to mobilize in their unions and put pressure on the bureaucracy that is causing fragmentation in a time where unity is absolutely necessary. <sep><sep> and by using voting cards, there is a risk of massive electoral fraud through such a private company. <sep><sep> Thus all parties and political currents will be represented in the National Assembly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> R: Yes, it's good, like that conference on agro-industry is good. <sep><sep> So, in this context, what I would have liked is to see us in 2011. <sep><sep> LALIT finds it immoral for ministers and deputies to vote for a budget that attacks universal elderly pension, while at the same time preserving their own lavish pensions as a right. <sep><sep> He also stated that Creole language should be used as a medium. <sep><sep> The vanguard worker can defend the track and all decisions made there by 100%, and is still in the labor movement, so he went to the capital to unionize himself with the union of workers from all around Mauritius, so many tracks are in trouble in the army. <sep><sep> The celebration of Creole Language World Day has a special significance in 2012. <sep> <sep> There were many interesting papers on cooperative development in different countries, on the global level cooperative situation and on the role of cooperatives in creating an egalitarian society based on solidarity and cooperation. <sep><sep> And we, in Mauritius, are not immune to these crises. <sep><sep> Once upon a time in a country there was Little Raju, Little Bay Abou, and Uncle Toulsi; once in a banana country, petals were scattered to announce the end. <sep><sep> Here, from a certain angle in the review Lalit de Classe number 1, there is an article called "State and Elections" which clearly explains our colonial state and shows how it differs from other bourgeois forms of government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Diego Garcia is also a place very well known to us. <sep><sep> Which consists of the establishment + property of the old import-export houses of Port Louis + the first banks that existed since the time of post-slavery. <sep><sep> There are people who we personally know who have 5, and we hear that there are some who have 10. Then when one of these characters receives criticism from one of those 9 other "people", they attack the person who criticized them, as if they knew all 10 of those other "people". <sep><sep> However, when this 3rd party who could make progress between any of these 3 is not separated. <sep><sep> Yesterday RA, in their complaint, they have already said they are not asking any questions. <sep><sep> Because all real power rests in another, when there is a crisis, it brings the others. <sep><sep> - He constantly stabilizes himself through a "State Bourgeoisie" that he is currently creating - through, for example, giving the State favours such as commands, invitations, logistical support, strengthening key positions that enhance a sector, etc. the bourgeois section which is not established. <sep><sep> People who rule over a society, whether in a democracy or a dictatorship or a monarchy, they are often too close to God. <sep><sep> It is a democratization that has nothing to do with giving people more rights, but rather favoring the emergence of a new group of big capitalists. <sep><sep> When the trade union movement and the opposition parties go to re-balance the MMM, giving it credibility vis-à-vis the working class, we, the French in Lalit, do not agree. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It attacks the system that is governed by different patriarchal hierarchies. <sep><sep> The government says it has a project "Sustainable Mauritius", but these are not global measures, they are mere lip service and the project "La Chaumiere" that we are promoting. <sep><sep> You may recall that in our campaign for an alternative economy, we put a lot of emphasis on what we called "systemic crisis" or "organic crisis" that Mauritius is going through, due to the crisis of production. <sep><sep> These messages are often repeated, re-repeated, and re-re-repeated in the press and on the radio, until they become the most detrimental bourgeois propaganda in society. <sep><sep> The faithful, despite resistance from the authorities in the early days, had made transformations so that the practical realization and popular culture come hand in hand. <sep><sep> Scientists have identified 9 critical factors that are threatening to create a fracture in the ecosystem. <sep><sep> There are 100 million people who have moved from "on-farm" to "off-farm" in agro-industry in Lasinn, without reducing agricultural production. <sep><sep> Among all seasonal workers, Paloma stands out with her very essence, especially her great versatility that had to be passed down by a great hairdresser (which we have never found), but all this is rather her actress performance. <sep><sep> And parents give grades 1-5 which she considers "the very first" for her child. <sep><sep> Well, roughly, based on a common agreement, how and when, we can act to remedy a flaw in this trend which will advance our program that we have agreed upon. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, yes, there are different levels of unionism, and we find the third level important. <sep><sep> This is with a lot of effort from Kishna, who went to another country to learn this trade, and has shared it with our members. <sep><sep> doubling the pancreas enzymes and affecting the immune system of these animals (See endnote). <sep><sep> Firstly, this makes no sense as transport companies have not requested any increase, it is the Government that has given them. <sep><sep> Even when we went into the MMM, we always maintained that line, that platform. <sep><sep> When you talk about "global competition", you are not talking about production at all. <sep><sep> LALIT has conducted 3 different series of political education courses, one with 15 courses with 20-odd people present GRNW, one with Kirpip and 30-odd people present, and one just started Flak. <sep><sep> He is a manager and he and his friend Celine work in the office. <sep><sep> However, the Prime Minister admitted in his speech, that countries like Mauritius that are "export oriented", are more vulnerable. <sep><sep> This term references AKM, to prepare necessary tools to introduce Creole in schools as a subject. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often when PMSD finds that it cannot play that role, then it goes looking for support in the slum areas. <sep> <sep> when he realizes that I am still alive, he comes to pick me up and take me to his place to ask his wife what to do. <sep> <sep> We need to stop converting agricultural land into Integrated Resorts Scheme (IRS) and start making efforts to create productive jobs. <sep> <sep> There was a spark in his eyes when he was talking about his vision of life. <sep> <sep> The sauce will be simmered for a whole year, and there will be divorces every day, not just on Fridays. <sep> <sep> Because in the economy, in bilateral or multilateral economic negotiations, when we talk WTO, we are betting on Africa. <sep> <sep> Advertising finishes before news and analysis. <sep> <sep> While military law is things they use to simply abolish with a feather or a bayonet, sometimes, all the rights of citizenship that you had, all the rights to demonstrate. <sep> <sep> They also allow to fill functions in routine classes, for example, to talk about climate or to to present a guest speaker. <sep> <sep> It also represents a recognition of LPT's persistence and consistency in promoting the Creole and Bhojpuri languages and bringing clarity for these 2 languages to be recognized at a state level. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The repetition was traveling to the neighboring villages like Mapou, Bonnvenn, Grangob, Lapoudor, Roster, Melvil, Mamzelzann, Plato without mentioning Hamlet and The Hermitage where people, young and old, admired it. <sep> <sep> They have an advantage to become one of the two "greats". <sep> <sep> He has a monopoly on the information to be spread, on the importance to give each new item, on the analysis and opinion to popularize in the country. <sep> <sep> All this banana, since then, we have not had mobilization. <sep> <sep> Many women present had worked very hard before, in different areas of France. <sep> <sep> "LALIT expresses our solidarity with the Burmese people in their brave struggle against the repression of the dictatorial regime that has seized power since 1962. <sep> <sep> And here we come to an important point in my schedule. <sep> <sep> What are you doing with all these dead leaves? Good composting! The garden is waiting for us in the near future. <sep> <sep> Are you interested in debating the problems affecting today's workers and jeopardizing the future of humanity? <sep> <sep> LALIT supports the MMM's demand to cancel the contract with Singapore for the new ID card. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Subron is making a big "media circus" in the syndicate, with the complicity of the government man Nita Deerpalsing, allowing him to break into other unions affiliated with FPU (which Bizlall still controls) and CTSP. <sep> Some people had their family and friends, who were all there to pump him up, pretending to "give results," pretending to have solved major problems. <sep> We don't find it surprising that the newspaper "Le Mauricien" has almost put all its resources on the negative reactions that the Employment Rights Bill is generating, as it replaces the Labour Act. <sep> In Mauritius itself, in the Tur d'Ebene region, there are many companies based in Mauritius that do accounting services for companies in America and France. <sep> e.g. In Southern Africa, there was a small country that had a nationalist ideology that included a significant anti-imperialist element. <sep> A Private Company, HAPPY WORLD, continues its legal pursuit against the Federation of United Workers and Education for Workers, concerning a leaflet that the FTU issued criticizing the Happy World boss during an industrial dispute. <sep> so that they can open doors for the Mauritian Government to negotiate for economic benefits, to have certain privileges for the bourgeoisie, but also with a glimmer of hope to get a word in power. <sep> All the working-class elements in the PTr leadership are mostly excluded. <sep> Everywhere, there were groups of volunteer workers digging, sifting through the soil, installing scaffolding everywhere. <sep> Yannick's friend said that the visit was a unique experience for him, as it was his first time traveling abroad, and at the same time, it was a trip where he was visiting a country in a revolutionary process. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They were joking around when suddenly Ganga posed Devi a direct question. <sep> He reorganized all the functions in the 70s. <sep> 354,000 men, 338,000 workers and 16,000 unemployed (4.7% unemployed). <sep> We have brought a campaign against IRA throughout our existence as Lalit. <sep> But gradually we find that it is not going as well as we were here. <sep> Workers in general are beginning to show a willingness to mobilize: but we need to develop our platform of demands through debate, we need to rally as many forces as possible to give weight to this program of demands. <sep> And the "community" it has drawn from all sides, as it will also stand for its form of candidacy. <sep> On all issues, there is a LALIT position: electoral reform, blue economy, mother tongue, communalism, racism. <sep> This includes the press-media, as well as government political nominations, any party in power in the country; sometimes this will include religious leaders, or even trade unionists. <sep> They all claimed to have no idea of the British and American plans. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ally Hosenbokus specified that within Lalit, there is a strong family participation and that Lalit's liberation program in favor of the family has links with the women's movement. <sep><sep> These grass-roots solutions are making progress in the working class and the poor communities. <sep><sep> The press not only demands changes from establishments such as the big ones, but it also makes other propaganda harder to recognize as propaganda. <sep><sep> Finally, in conclusion, it is found that recent events in 2004 show that Ashok Subron was organizing a faction around himself through his personal strategies within the union. <sep><sep> Male workers were saying that this family was making them work harder so that big capitalists could make a profit; <sep><sep> It was through NTUC that Ashok Subron followed an IT course at ILO, Turin, and now, on August 21st, Ashok Subron has been re-elected to the ILO, but this time, under his personal and professional name. <sep><sep> Why do we say this, because often political parties on some occasions say "Yes, there must be more debate on this issue." <sep><sep> Other individuals who have written books in Creole include Jean-Claude Bibi, Ram Seegobin, Ragini Kistnasamy, Rajni Lallah, Alain Ah-Vee, Lindsey Collen, Rada Kistnasamy, where non-fiction books, poets, writers, and healers, among other literary works, are included. <sep><sep> When the USA is economically weakened, when Europe is in crisis, it naturally becomes stronger, thus the Palestinians may rally people on a basis of an alliance for the interest of the working class and all oppressed people, with no exceptions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Unfortunately, certain organizations have chosen to tackle the issue of "reparations" from a rather sectional and communal perspective. <sep> <sep> All that MMM-MSM have done (in the face of crisis) is to simply change the death penalty law, so that the Estate will receive money for VRS compensation, and abolish 10,000 laborer positions. <sep> <sep> Also, when a novelist is writing a novel, even if it is subtle, he or she is making a significant invisible contribution: people who give him or her time and material space to create, people who fuel his or her creativity with their stories. <sep> <sep> Go ask someone his dreams, inquire what he found interesting. <sep> <sep> But there is a price to pay for my freedom. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin stated that at a SIDS conference he attended in Barbados, phrases were mostly focused on environmental and sustainable development. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, there were also serious economic problems looming around Independence. <sep> <sep> At the Lalit Ver Conference, which took place on the 1st and 2nd of November, Emilie Wiehe presented a paper entitled "Fault Analysis of Ecological / Energy Problems." <sep> <sep> His words were strong but clear and resonated deeply with Afro-Kreol emotions. <sep> <sep> and at the same time the book represents the most beautiful poetry during an entire historical era. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The evening breeze felt so gentle: to die discreetly in its warmth. <sep><sep> Then, different members bring this "golden opportunity" into their branches, discussing it, delving into it. <sep><sep> Does it receive 20% of old feray, as PT was saying when MSM-MMM came to power? <sep><sep> MMM announced that it will set up a Patriotic Committee at the beginning. <sep><sep> More than ten days ago, I wrote a small letter to a great editor about a little girl. <sep><sep> A conference initiated by certain ecologists, writers recently have been advocating emerging technologies for manipulation by the British government. <sep><sep> Not only that, it imposes on more than 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank who have to live in several fragmented, separate enclaves. <sep><sep> In addition to fundamental objections, LALIT does not agree to excessive spending to acquire EVM, and we also face the risk of having to spend more for each election and maintain computer equipment every 3 years. <sep><sep> Our strategic objective is to fight and overthrow capitalism, and establish a socialist system. <sep><sep> As long as these cultural elements are not dominated, it would not be a problem if we pass on a foreign culture, even inconsistently. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>This is being done, through a series of measures such as cutting social services, reducing wages and increasing prices. <sep><sep> Can the disease fade through mosquitoes, causing mosquito bites? <sep><sep> Checkpoints block certain roads, segregating access routes, an apartheid road. <sep><sep> In the LALIT we think that political moves to bring Chagos back to the UN would put Mauritius in a strong political and legal position. <sep><sep> They set up small companies, a boss gives them work, and they are at the mercy of small entrepreneurs. <sep><sep> Our program and our team of candidates have been well received. <sep><sep> Lack of vim became Timi because people are happy to talk about the economy and they have a point. <sep><sep> So, for us, “economy”, in a Marxist analysis, it concerns the "pure story", too. <sep><sep> Why articles on action in Palestine with actions by organizations in Israel that are fighting for peace and a solution, and in doing so, making progress in the world? <sep><sep> Today, unions only focus on each issue - a leaky school roof, then a hundred DWC workers, then exams - without seeing the link between all these problems and a general crisis in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and Marx himself, they did not make predictions like Mrs. Kok or Mrs. Laguy do when they play cards with the crystal ball. <sep>
<sep> All of us belong to a party and have no place to go. <sep>
<sep> PT-MSM-PMSD-MMM, they all have plunged into an economic policy that focuses on sectors that have no future. <sep>
<sep> We know today's results where many of the USSR countries have become satellite states of China! <sep>
<sep> Meanwhile, the government must invest in agriculture, increase fish production in fish farms, more transformation of sea products, not just a "Sea-Food Hub" like a special Fish Zone in France. <sep>
<sep> There were reports even of commercial homes and construction workers with this investment. <sep>
<sep> Grup Menwar, youth in Amnesty, and Grup Favory presented poems, slogans, and music and expressed solidarity with the Burmese people. <sep>
<sep> Minister Sithanen is responsible for fighting poverty and legal crises in the private sector and NGOs, through CRS (Corporate Social Responsibility) and Empowerment Fund. <sep>
<sep> This means that the Social Alliance controls 13 constituencies (9 entirely, with an over figure of 67%, and 4 with a 2/1 ratio) and the MMM-MSM control 7 (4 entirely, and 3 with a 2/1 ratio). <sep>
<sep> There is a possibility for the Historical Opposition Bloc, sitting Worker Class Historical Bloc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And only a small part can build a "historical" block in the future. <sep><sep> For economic reasons, "politics" is the management of power in all sectors that already exist; it represents a "consensus model". <sep><sep> They have had a formal meeting with Lalit, we are ready to offer them a program. <sep><sep> and the celebration of "African Language Day," which the African Union will declare for 2006. <sep><sep> This will provide the final product for the local and regional/international markets. <sep><sep> People who have land access and the government that has its policies, are told to continue planting sugar cane, should we believe them? <sep><sep> He had finished his secondary education and was still living with his mother. <sep><sep> This is where we need to pay very close attention. <sep><sep> Is there information on predictions, in other words, ancient traditions, digital prints, political affiliations, union activities? <sep><sep> for example, providing a social security allowance to people who do not have a job and at the same time the government needs to take responsibility for creating clean environments where people feel safe. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we reach Iraq, and the way Diego has been used, which is part of Moris. <sep><sep> This problem excludes some members of the Lalit movement since the CAWU Assembly had already finished discussing in the party structures, and Ashok Subron's reaction was if he is very sorry FOR OURSELVES it has caused "certain discomfort." <sep><sep> We need to ensure that we act together, understand you, and intervene only when necessary and useful, and not out of desire or partisanship. <sep><sep> Another journalist took up with UBS to publish articles about the company, and this was exposed by the said UBS company. <sep><sep> Anyway, you should re-consult, 14 days after, do a check to see if everything has been settled. <sep><sep> Naturally, if there is a class struggle, where the power equation is unbalanced, what is stronger will win. <sep><sep> This gives us an idea of the pressure that exists to separate these issues. <sep><sep> Get the Rapor Select Committee 1982 and Diego Files by Henri Marimootoo, published in Week-End. <sep><sep> In Davos, which is currently gathering, even the boss and people in the state are noting this crisis. <sep><sep> This debate is well documented in LALIT - there are a series of articles in the Lalit de Klas review as well as a book on the MMM dedicated to this clear betrayal called "The story of a betrayal". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he says that will allow Mauritians to choose their own doctor; <sep> * Your place manager, perhaps, their functions at the place where one chooses who will occupy that post (although the method is the same for some administrative posts in the Zini government) and that all those officials are revocable at any time. <sep> * Then 3 others get about 6%: Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Plato, and Kant. <sep> * This sum of money represents the price of the courage of work. <sep> * But anyone who reads it, knows that he has an analysis and a primary strategy on why MMM-MSM lost. <sep> * Not only that, but he also says that people are spreading rumors, saying that the weakness of the MSM caused the MMM-MSM to lose. <sep> * To decide the content of the festival, and the way they will organize it. <sep> * Simé Abercrombie was stuck between 4pm and nearly midnight. <sep> * Therefore, what X.Duval is doing today is not entirely different from what his father Gaëtan Duval did in the past, when he proclaimed himself as the 'creole leader'. <sep> * Maybe the comrades have read a series of long interviews by a bug named Percy Mistry (he's quite a mystery, "very mysterious"). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Regarding the issue of Matrimonial Law, particularly in the context of reintroducing "personal laws", there is a debate on the punishment in matrimonial law. <sep> <sep> In Mauritius, more than 40% of children who leave primary school after 6-7 years struggle to learn to read/write properly, or remember numbers well. <sep> <sep> We are not just going to give in to bureaucracy. <sep> <sep> Before the meeting on October 28th, we used to have grand celebrations together with the Municipality, etc, and we reduced it to a municipal declaration! <sep> <sep> Yes, my friend, but the struggle is in favor of the oppressed, whether they are workers, unemployed, women, LGBTQ+ or pensioners. <sep> <sep> This economic crisis has also affected bourgeois state institutions: <sep> <sep> But despite pressure from the trade union movement being strong, in certain measures it is falling, as it is quite difficult for the union movement to operate in different sectors outside a logical framework. <sep> <sep> It is an important decision, and it frees the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work for the unity of SADC, and then the African Union, to maintain their close ties with Israel. <sep> <sep> There were all kinds of rare plant specimens, animals, birds, insects, flowers, and species. <sep> <sep> Even if a child is born out of wedlock, the father defines their status as "his" child. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that each member represents a force, and when this force is combined, when it is shared collectively, it creates an extraordinary wealth and it is this wealth that generates a program. <sep>  There has been a similar movement of people towards the city, the industrial feel in Europe and America as well. <sep> This also means, it is responsible for this electoral fraud. <sep> Specifically medicines, food, school equipment, construction materials for the population of Gaza facing a blockade by Israel. <sep> It is too difficult to find a unified national government for the time being. <sep> It is because people are living in a void, where there is no perspective for the future. <sep> The Greens and MR have not elected any of their candidates, their leaders Sylvio Michel and Rama Valayden have not been elected, only Rama Valayden has entered Parliament as Attorney General. <sep> And especially in JUSTICE, we have encouraged the families of the victims to come together, talk openly, protest, not feel ashamed for crimes committed by others, not to be covered up by the State. <sep> Recently we had heated discussions in the village of Marda over the past two weeks. <sep> And the decision to go on strike, it must be a collective decision, not an addition of individual decisions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, many of them did not have a vision, a political class directive. <sep><sep> Another worker in Lasinn has shown his wound, it seems his head is broken. <sep><sep> This will be an important opportunity for Navin Ramgoolam to raise money from UNESCO for a significant project to convert to sign language in maternal language. <sep><sep> So, Marx linked society with natural reality, in an ecological vision. <sep><sep> All the children in the bush are playing soldiers. <sep><sep> The authorities used this as an excuse to say there was no warning. <sep><sep> A ceremony that had no value at all for it to suddenly become a life-or-death question where it would destroy its relationship with its great family dynasty because of a television show. <sep><sep> Or is this just clearing the crisis for a few years, while at the same time Mauritius is facing a shortage of cane and facilities? <sep><sep> Then the colonists put pressure on the government in Israel to provide infrastructure and loans. <sep><sep> All this was happening outside the control of men who were unable to imagine another kind of life than what they were used to living. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the lessons of certain workers, they say, "No, no, I am not a worker." <sep> <sep> In the context of food crisis, should the union have a place in the hearts of those who say we need to continue monopolizing land like sugarcane plantations? <sep> <sep> Therefore, it reflects faithfully a political and economic situation of the country. <sep> <sep> As of today, the government, unlike others, does not say what actions are being taken for these children. <sep> <sep> But do I know what I want? Isn't it dangerous to turn one's back like this, to turn away from the future with the past, to say a categorical no to all beliefs, values and traditions? <sep> <sep> For all children to be able to develop, the government must stop imposing English and French, discriminating against Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep> <sep> The Zenn Lalit Commission had invited Alain Ah-Vee, a member of LALIT who learned this skill in Goa in London, to share his knowledge. <sep> <sep> The UK government is now having to offer Chagossians the opportunity to visit Diego Garcia and other Chagos islands. <sep> <sep> Finally, the Prime Minister, he too, holds the same position as MMM and the Block 104 affidavit. <sep> <sep> And we develop important political demands, such as the need for a living allowance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this is happening against a backdrop of "electoral reform," which needs a majority of two-thirds, so it can become a pretext for a coalition. <sep><sep> Another significant meaning is "alien," where alienation means "fu". <sep><sep> Today we are publishing Cindy Clelie's speech in the mother tongue in the context of the education system. <sep><sep> South America, many countries, including the Caribbean Basin, which is part of NAFTA, export to the Americas, but at no time have they claimed that the competition that Mauritius is facing is an argument that has no basis. <sep><sep> And these demands have continued until now. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam is protecting his friend, a political behavior that is not good. <sep><sep> His response is "Well, everyone says what they want, and I do what I want." <sep><sep> There are around thirty who sleep in Kazern, in Phoenix, in Lenor. <sep><sep> Most experienced workers realize that they cannot easily work for more than 18 months in this type of work without affecting their psychological health. <sep><sep> Then other workers notice that certain men with bicycles, raise their hands, arrive before the truck workers, they start to sharpen their machetes in the dark. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He explained that despite being backward in the world of work and underestimated by those who work to live, there have been several movements of contestation in the last 3 bananas. <sep><sep> This sanction of the law, also, is a "watershed". <sep><sep> There are a million other ways that society could organize the way it disseminates information and analysis. <sep><sep> High prices - the shame of the world who live in Buenaventura and who do not receive any prize (The International Reading Association Prize). <sep><sep> Cinema Hall, theater, amphitheaters, libraries were being built through them. <sep><sep> We have written our position against the resettlement of Chagossians in favor of the military base on Diego,and we have written an analysis of Diego for the press there. <sep><sep> The following report has been reconstructed from its notes and from Minits, with the permission of the assembly. <sep><sep> We must continue to build a feminist resistance against all forms of patriarchy and must not continue this old system where predators hide in trade union organizations. <sep><sep> Then he returned to Parliament thanks to the partial elections No8 in 2008 where he faced his uncle Ashok Jugnauth, who had MMM support. <sep><sep> He was known to weaken the IFB, Workers Bolom Ramgoolam, Berenger, Bizlall and Subron He was known to dance to the extreme right as Duval, as populist as Valayden. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is also a lot of speculation on other alliances with Workers. <sep><sep> Then, the RIOT men have been attacking since their arrival. <sep><sep> from the protection of the profiteer establishment near the edge of the production meal: <sep><sep> BBC Radio in England even, in 2006 when it carried out a national survey, a competition, in a series of rounds, where experts on each philosophy would defend it, like a National League, Karl Marx emerged as the victor. <sep><sep> There are also other Ministers who are fighting for their political survival, because there has been a death following negligence. <sep><sep> rising prices, insecurity in the workplace, and threats weighing on all laborers, artisans, and small plantation workers, and workers in the Free Zone. <sep><sep> The Bank Boss, the owner of big companies, George Bush, Gordon Brown, Sarkozy, all of them, had their say on television. <sep><sep> We do this work on the radio, and it is often well received by people. <sep><sep> We are continuing in LALIT, realizing the importance of political activism. <sep><sep> All researchers were asking the Samazeste government to stop the campaign of subversion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And each of these symptoms tends to amplify other symptoms. <sep>

<sep> There are 16 mirrors that vary between 400 m long and 3000 m long and 17 traces that vary between 200 m long and 19,000 m long. <sep>

<sep> This is very clear in the case of the Lalmati double crime. <sep>

<sep> The school was closed because Wednesday is a half-day in Palestine and Friday is a non-school day. <sep>

<sep> Even in the Lovelock book, where many members of the public were privileged, there is this idea. <sep>

<sep> An article has been published to pose political strategy questions to MMM signed by a group of MMM militants after the 2010 election. <sep>

<sep> If the union is bankrupt, the workers express their anger by stopping work at home. <sep>

<sep> They also, they won’t agree to stay, to give you what you're asking for because you're asking. <sep>

<sep> Lalit together with many workers' rights and immigrant organizations will meet in Mauritius on Saturday, February 24th to prepare the Ecuador Conference. <sep>

<sep> Without a new wave of mobilization, the former permanent state machinery, and the "military industrial complex" that has reigned for so many years, to regain all the power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the campaign for discounts started in 1976 in different phases, it has become something normal for the anti-family movement to rally behind the Bil River. <sep><sep> A neighbor, I., explains that there are numerous armed forces and colonies in the villages Like Hares. <sep><sep> He organizes workshops on kiba, on revolutions in kiba. <sep><sep> It is usually stable enough for it to rain in an exemplary way (meaning without question). <sep><sep> When we talk about education, we do not exclude political/economic education at the adult level. <sep><sep> How can we do it without losing our jobs, without risking arrest, without our employer installing us in forced labor? <sep><sep> Or, we could organize people in a way where we acknowledge the fact that he is already organizing: <sep><sep> To look at the AKM leaf, during that one year. <sep><sep> And the history of the PTr. Meaning a party that, on one hand, is creating a bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, is desperately seeking an electoral base from the working class. <sep><sep> What that signifies is that a doctor can tell you: “Comrade, despite your diabetes, despite your cancer, despite everything, you are in good health!”. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MSM-MMM has abolished village elections and is introducing a regional electoral system that diminishes democracy and favors parties with significant wealth. <sep> <sep> It knew what it had to do and without protest, it did it. <sep> <sep> LALIT believes that the voting system is functioning well, and if any problems arise, they can be managed smoothly, but the issue with EVMs is only a technical challenge beyond our understanding. <sep> <sep> We believe that development depends on mastering our own language, and mastering our language depends on our thinking about development. <sep> <sep> Workers who work from home are even more vulnerable, even though electronic work has more stability. <sep> <sep> Because everyone in Mauritius is affected, in every village, every corner of the city, everywhere has finally realized why the Chagos people have protested, why they have declared a RIOT, why they are on a hunger strike. <sep> <sep> So, they attack, while pretending that Workers are attacking "big capital," "oligarchs," etc. <sep> <sep> 2 LALIT activists, Kisna Kistnasamy and Alain Ah-Vee, had already participated in actions with ISM and other Palestinian groups in occupied territories in 2004 and 2007. <sep> <sep> Marx describes the class struggle as a national political struggle. <sep> <sep> Mauritius deposited a motion before the UN on May 11, 1990. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Starting to prepare a synthesis, which will constitute a basis for continuing negotiations. <sep><sep> "Lalit Program," he said, "it is a program for women's liberation." <sep><sep> He also emphasized that it is the Church that says we must protect innocent lives. <sep><sep> Malthus said that if the population is too strong, don't do anything, don't take any drastic action, let "survival of the fittest" happen. <sep><sep> One of our first tasks is to make people understand that LALIT will participate in elections despite the fact that the press tends to present it partially as a battle between uncle and nephew, somewhat like a soap opera. <sep><sep> The newspaper called them "Toktok" because to enter their meeting, one had to knock twice: tok, tok. <sep><sep> But at that moment, he was a bit perplexed because he knew his house was under surveillance and he was worried about what their visit with the children of his nephew might entail. <sep><sep> He didn’t want to define himself by whether he spoke French fluently or not. <sep><sep> Lalit drew public attention, especially during the SIDS Conference when Prime Minister Berenger talked a lot about "democracy," and the year 2005 was about to begin with political repression. <sep><sep> The Central Market Administration proposed Samy to take charge. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT we must think as members of a strict party as well as individuals. <sep><sep> We need to create ideas, organize actions, and develop a program for punishment from below to within society. <sep><sep> Wake up at 6 in the morning, get ready, have breakfast, go here, go there, start at the office, coordinate, work 10 hours, then get Rs 6,000 per month?" <sep><sep> But in Gaza, the Israeli Army has clearly declared what makes it impossible for anyone to escape from bombing. <sep><sep> The hall was packed at the Nelson College for Lalit's fourth forum on Friday 19th May at 4:30. <sep><sep> In the past, we've distributed pamphlets, meaning a specific pamphlet for a region, a sector, where the pamphlet has a problem in that region, and in other areas, there are more general political issues. <sep><sep> So it's no wonder that when the Alliance Government presented a new law, the MMM and MSM have rather staged walk-outs when Valayden took the floor, instead focused on the licensing scandal of Cunningham in the legal profession, and rather concentrated on the Chady scandal. <sep><sep> Since earning a salary at six, he decided to go work in a sector. <sep><sep> Their case got lost by the police, they're focusing on a series of procedural issues in this case. <sep><sep> Successful governments are perpetuating this monopoly by stifling the multicultural interests in the oligarchy-controlled security industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This beautiful poem by Goethe, I am finishing it and I am excited about reading the last pages of an extraordinary book by Leon Trotsky, his autobiography, where he recounts the emergence of two socialists: <sep><sep> This makes Kalianee Jhugroo, who believes in true Labour, disturbed. <sep><sep> 1. We find that there are various forms of resistance in different parts of the world, in the Arab world, in Europe, in China, in Sudan but at the same time we observe certain weaknesses such as lack of political coordination, like a political program challenging international capitalist economy. <sep><sep> And if today we are still meeting with all the other individuals who are trying to strengthen some party bases in the world, we have a single requirement. <sep><sep> We make a call to the global movement that fights for peace, for justice, for a sustainable ecology; to all movements that fight against war. <sep><sep> On the issue of Greece, today we notice a positive evolution, a remarkable convergence. <sep><sep> They say there should be a "strict reform program" which mainly consists of making everyone pay for increasing the profits of employers. <sep><sep> They become Jericho in some apparently desperate situations, very quickly efficient leaders start to emerge, organize themselves and channel their energy towards rapid development. <sep><sep> One L. urges everyone to become a unique family. <sep><sep> But, despite all these divisions that were already beginning to emerge, the trade union managed to work together in a Trade Union Common Platform when the government came up with its new Employment Rights Bill and Employment Relations Bill. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What Lalit is saying is that we need to amend the Constitution first to remove this Seat which inaugurated communalism into politics. <sep><sep> Dany Marie and Kim Ng stopped working for various reasons  <sep><sep> This is why it is called the bourgeois state, it is here to impose and promote the bourgeoisie's ideology, its plan. <sep><sep> Following a decision in a Members' Assembly to promote more political education, and to open meetings to people outside the party, we have conducted political education on a large scale. <sep><sep> Why is he not exposing the fact that Berenger accused him, that he was arrested on false charges? <sep><sep> Year after year, Government after Government is trying to do internationally what needs to be done to reclaim sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. <sep><sep> Storms are coming and you are becoming insignificant. <sep><sep> So, in just 2-3 points in the LALIT platform, an Electoral Work Platform, and he only had to make them user-friendly when elected. <sep><sep> Since its creation, the Movement for the Liberation of Women Workers (MLF) has put a lot of emphasis on the need for women to organize as workers and have found this to be a central aspect of the struggle for women's liberation. <sep><sep> What the government should immediately ratify is the ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Israeli workers are unionized, entitled to pensions and social security. <sep> <sep> The economic crisis is worsening their desire to react. <sep> <sep> He needs a boss, he cannot maintain his existence without this class of boss. <sep> <sep> When an American company took over the control, the boss insisted on improving productivity, good attendance. <sep> <sep> Today we are seeing a wave of petitions on the internet to support Tibet's autonomy, as we have never seen before, circulating by an intellectual trail that stumbles, with reason, against repression by the Lasinn army. <sep> <sep> Others do not know why, and they die without knowing why. <sep> <sep> And with "anti-imperialist struggle," MMM joins this nationalist and consciousness struggle. <sep> <sep> When they say "Hey, what are we doing!" they will be more negative about what LALIT proposes, often. <sep> <sep> Think about the political parties that defend capitalist interests. <sep> <sep> Lawyer Ramloll, the Senior State Counsel who is defending the police in this case, said he almost didn't provide a statement to the police on the same day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As a result, the first GMOs being trafficked by MSIRI have been modified to be resistant to Round-Up herbicide. <sep><sep> Therefore, Marx doesn't see any mechanical intermediary as certain ignorant detractors claim. <sep><sep> - this class has the strength and will to change the current system, that is, the entire salary system, when it is acting. <sep><sep> But, most importantly, for example, LALIT activists, we put a lot of effort into a society that has a lot of laughter, while it is bringing it, and more amusingly transporting victories. <sep><sep> And in 2001 it was no longer a dilemma but a practice regulated by the Public Health Code. <sep><sep> The representation of family is like the Aimée system where regional elections - that is, not more than 2 men or 2 women per constituency. <sep><sep> The experiences it had in the 'then' period opened up its ears to the often difficult test of seeking to do everything the same or everywhere. <sep><sep> At the end of the 19th century, there were sanctions in the sugar industry. <sep><sep> The former government and Sithanen said they would make licensing easier and more efficient. <sep><sep> *As victims: the union has become stronger; and the victim has space to divide the issue, break the silence, bring evidence in public for the public to find and resolve. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But a capitalism weakened by the people (especially the people of Larisi, who have taken up the challenge to break free from the capitalist yoke) has faced this challenge. <sep><sep> * We have launched several fronts like "Rann nu Diego" which regroup trade unions and social organizations. <sep><sep> WHAT ARE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT SALARY AND WORKING CONDITIONS? <sep><sep> However, now, when you give it all, put it in the hands of the union and the employer, a series of other issues arise and the union has weakened in the face of the IRA, as we have found. <sep><sep> We are proposing measures to protect the environment so that we can leave a habitable earth for the generations to come after us. <sep><sep> The pressure of time, the "Struggle between classes" and "Internationalism." <sep><sep> It is important, and it will help us after the elections. <sep><sep> When Jamouna showed clear signs that he wanted to make love, Dass acted as if he was seeking something else. <sep><sep> and especially after debates and reflections in Lalit's institutions; branches, seminars, and commissions since one year. <sep><sep> And behind all this, the local media which will have their place reserved, disinformation, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I wanted to say that this classroom lesson is part of our daily life, where we all work to survive. <sep><sep> It is urgent to ensure the return of Chagossians to all their islands, including Diego, just as there should be freedom of movement for all Mauritians in the entirety of the Mauritian territory. <sep><sep> He successfully convinced them, and after verifications (- not too sure if the soldiers went to check something or they already know the driver and were just intimidating the driver). <sep><sep> And having Diego in a strategic position to ensure this kind of surveillance and control. <sep><sep> And to support Mauritius fully, he insists that Great Britain will not acknowledge ICJ for any dispute dating back before 1974. <sep><sep> This kind of bureaucratic maneuvering does not necessarily serve the working class's interests, especially in a time when the working class is facing serious economic crisis threats. <sep><sep> He takes one leaf at a time, he gathers, he arranges, all of this becomes dry in another pile. <sep><sep> The reason Ashok Subron excluded LALIT members with more experience in unionism, he becomes clear when we see the contradictions in the Anyel CAWU General Assembly. <sep><sep> On the other hand, were there measures that could have been taken before this Saturday, that's for sure. <sep><sep> This means we are not only looking at what the union does, nor even what the federation does, but rather looking at strict disciplinary sanctions within the entire union movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Plan to outsource certain operations, such as repair work, to a private garage. This visit will reduce debt in the country. <sep><sep> So, if we truly want less crime, less drug dealing, less sexual violence, the important thing is for people leaving prison, because when they leave, they need to be reformed. <sep><sep> The introduction of Creole and Bhojpuri languages as optional subjects in schools in 2012 marks progress in the recognition of mother tongue languages in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Forget the past! We see..' - 'He told me before his death that my father. <sep><sep> Boys, girls, kids all gathered around him. <sep><sep> There have been a series of sectors affected by this new crisis in the capitalist system: the tourist industry, for example, where a number of tourists have remained stable, some even slightly decreased, while the number of hotel nights has increased. <sep><sep> so either you have “faith”, but still appeal to capitalist logic. <sep><sep> Jean Claude Bibi criticized those who are against their reasoning that: a fetish is an innocent object, so when someone destroys a fetish, it is not a crime and should not be condemned. <sep><sep> And after Lehman Brothers, a major institutional bank, declared bankruptcy, then the states in all these countries have used tax money to bail out these big banks and insurance companies that went bankrupt. <sep><sep> previous sexual morality has been discredited ("Thou shalt not commit adultery" because God said so, or because your family will cast you out). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MMM was a political leadership force within the workers' class movement that mobilized both politically and unionally. <sep><sep> However, during the protest, another law has been in effect since last year; since last year, you have lost your rights. <sep><sep> The concept of "Historical Bloc," it's a concept that Antonio Gramsci developed, 100 years ago, and it's interesting as a concept of "systemic crisis" as well. <sep><sep> So, there should have been some control, because there was a slight unraveling. <sep><sep> It appears that it has provided data not only to Google, its boss, but also to Mubarak's secret service. <sep><sep> And when Zizman Balancy comes, he, Berenger, agrees. <sep><sep> But, the proceedings and debates in Parliament are conducted in a language spoken by people who have sold their souls. <sep><sep> Lalit did not have any plastic zones because we do not believe in sheltering individuals. <sep><sep> K. and D. have talked to the Palestinians who are waiting for their clear ID cards by force. <sep><sep> Even now, when looking at the allegations faced by the Medpoint Clinic, why did they encounter difficulties, when they have faced aggression, how rare it is to witness such a direct attack on the clinic's main organizers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He had to accept that the country had undergone significant changes; life had become more modern. <sep><sep> One thing i can say is that it is easy to get lost in the maze of olive trees because we do not have any markers. <sep><sep> A union leader heard him say, "Listen, in our establishment, why don't we get our VRS?" He forgot that VRS stands for Voluntary Retirement Scheme. <sep><sep> It is a good reminder that in 1989, G. Duval supported the MMM candidate, Ivan Collendavelloo, in the La Caverne-Phoenix constituency. <sep><sep> And today, unions and social workers are leading a battle against the dismantling of the Welfare State. <sep><sep> All this does not mean that elections in the Republic are a waste. <sep><sep> The true meaning of the term “leadership” is shown in this. <sep><sep> But, Radio Plus and Radio One set a condition: if we have a program, we have to talk about one subject and not go off topic: What topic? <sep><sep> Both for export as well as for substituting what we import. <sep><sep> According to the Week-End article, this new card will also contain other information that can be helpful as well as health cards, driving permits, social security, business, and maybe even elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Social Alliance not only has a majority in parliament but also controls all Ministries and District Councils. <sep><sep> It called for a meeting of all councilors in which it proposed the creation of an administrative group under its leadership with the sharing of responsibilities with different parties. <sep><sep> Many times, we talk in clubs, in meetings, in society, and once someone finishes their speech, ask 2-3 questions, feel happy, and leave. <sep><sep> Latin America 1948, Cuba 1958, Chile 1970, Vietnam 1975, South Africa 1994. <sep><sep> All these movements were both defensive and inward-looking capitalist, sometimes nationalist bourgeois, have become predominant between 1980-2010. <sep><sep> Despite the instability situation of PTr/PMSD, Navin Ramgoolam is still popularly perceived as retaining all the support received, taking from communal-religious organizations, women's associations, and the youth through the Workers Congress where Robin Sharma is invited, but also he excels in the cultural field. <sep><sep> For women's movement, the fact that there are no women in these positions is like a mirror to show that there is inequality in society as women cannot participate in decision-making at all levels; <sep><sep> The Government-MSPA conflict deadlock is moving towards energy issues. <sep><sep> Apart from the MBC, which has a duty to be "accountable". In a broader perspective, there is a world of difference between the Workers' Party that has all kinds of interests as a party, and the "State". <sep><sep> Because the women's movement is seeking equality, its natural ally is the workers' class organization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> An employer may lay off workers if they do not produce the quantity the employer wants. <sep><sep> Then Cunningham attack 'a mafia' saying there are ones in the office of the DPP, the police, the judicial field, the office of the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Today, PMSD with X.Duval as its leader is a party that regroups mainly technocrats and businessmen like A.Godere, M.Sik Yuen, Nicole Hack, Lindsay Morvan, Mirella Chauvin, Mamad Khodabacus, J.Panglose, N.Kistnen, R.Mardemootoo, A.Perraud, R.Desveaux, A.Makoon. <sep><sep> As we say, former Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth already analyzed it. <sep><sep> He will also announce what his strategy is with Mrs. <sep><sep> There will be speeches from Arnaud Carpooran, Lindsey Collen, and Alain Ah Vee. <sep><sep> Families who had constant contact with the plantation owners were waiting for something to happen. <sep><sep> When a storm began to rise, it gradually subsided, and he made certain amendments to his proposals that his attorney had demanded. <sep><sep> Other women did not have the courage to confront their leader, but their support would have been for Timi. <sep><sep> Other people could challenge or question the competence in the Supreme Court. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> *On the international scene, through our report to the UN Committee on Human Rights and our deposition before the UN Committee against Torture, we have brought the fight to the international stage, where states are sometimes more sensitive (for economic reasons). <sep><sep> Did you know that there are people who are dismantling the wall, as a form of protest? <sep><sep> It's not enough to act only through the union, which sometimes leads to mere verbal disputes to replace action (to not lose rights). <sep><sep> There is a problem (at least in the Ministry of Sinatambou). <sep><sep> And I can make a comment on that. <sep><sep> Develop stockpiling, preservation, and other agro-industrial activities to absorb surplus food production, prepare it for exportation, and create additional jobs. <sep><sep> In the technical team, new teachers and staff who are implementing the introduction of Creole and Bhojpuri languages in primary education. <sep><sep> It sits only with a network that allows it to face this dominant ideology. <sep><sep> "So in conclusion, we can come back to other more urgent matters, if in politics we have participated with the Chagossians and other people in the "Return our Diego" demonstration since 77-78. <sep><sep> After many years of service, a family finds itself in a single bloodline with no means of survival, neither for it nor for those who have entrusted it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Movements sindical, like all tulezan since 5-6 bananas, they are meeting in Beau-Bassin on the taxi square. <sep><sep> The only thing that Afghanistan refuses could economically do is to plant poppies (poppy - used to make opium and heroin). <sep><sep> The state no longer negotiates quotas and prices for establishing relations with Europe, no fixed minimum wage for at least a thousand people, no longer take taxes out, to no longer define factory areas with the same facilities, to no longer have a semi-state to support sugar cane-industry. <sep><sep> He began to recall a story that a great man told. <sep><sep> Timi asked him to arrange a storage for feeding the goats and a poultry. <sep><sep> But the way I see it, I have the impression that he will finish last. <sep><sep> Suddenly, Rodrige's planters followed a 3-week course on how to properly prune apple trees. <sep><sep> There were many young people in the Amnesty bands who gave themselves to this watch and there were artists Henry Favory and Alain Auriant accompanied by Damien Elisa and other musicians who also participated in the watch. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee said that the publication of this poem was a way to celebrate the Creole language and it was also a tribute to poetry in our mother tongue. <sep><sep> It's not just in our heads, it's in the protected Heart. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, this capitalism has taken the form of domination of speculative capital, financial capital, which has become a powerful force in the global economic system. <sep><sep> It finds itself, against its will, entangled in these last 5,000 bananas, because there are these conflicts. <sep><sep> Now there is a sea in Beau-Bassin-Rose-Hill, Norbert Froget, which we notice is using repression against the small markets. <sep><sep> a political platform together, a platform that will unite and mobilize the trade union movement and political parties. <sep><sep> Surely Konntou had almost predicted his destiny which would follow Jamouna like water follows a canal. <sep><sep> This shows the importance of a strict political structure, as with revolutionary political parties. <sep><sep> Then all individuals who are not aristocrats, all individuals who are not princes and princesses, they all would be "citizens" and they would have something absolutely new in the world. <sep><sep> The current reality is that it is a class struggle that must dominate in this battle for reparations for what slavery has done to Mauritian society. <sep><sep> Cuba and Venezuela, 2 challenges against the capitalist system, one for over 50 years, the other in the last 10 years, both countries are experiencing a crisis. <sep><sep> Here, for the Resistance and the First May Movement on the 10th of March, they do not make it clear to everyone why they are marching. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Gete, Laflam is burning Makabe and his sufferings are suffocating the sky; Lasid is writing with red ink on the Montagn Signo rosewood; Lasann is flying everywhere, filling the lungs with the gray death. <sep><sep> This was supposed to be a prophecy to allow an alliance between the MMM and MSM, but when Paul Berenger wanted to dissolve Parliament, he waited for President Jugnauth. <sep><sep> We sent him that letter on October 31, 2003. <sep><sep> When a party wins, it takes control of a part of the State, then it has a duty to act in an equitable manner towards the various oppressive forces, while being the "State". <sep><sep> Minister Boolell said it is important to react, and to give this issue an international dimension. <sep><sep> - I will look at what demands/claims in this context are legitimate, which demands are valid, meaning transitional demands (which I will explain). <sep><sep> So, before the big strike in 1981, there was already a mobilization underway. <sep><sep> And finally, there was a fairly repressive crackdown, which we still find today in the MBC, in the new Local Government Act, in threats against the press, etc. <sep><sep> So currently, there is a disorganization, where each union is pulling in its own direction, leading to division among the workers in this sector. <sep><sep> Since 2008, it is true that in EriA and EreA, workers are discovering what they are facing and workers have to confront this daily. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - It is a pleasure that there are people with experience in the education of Mauritian children: Om Varma, Ramesh Padaruth, Arnaud Carpooran, Danielle Turner, Vinesh Hookoomsing, Menon Munien, Nita Raghoonundun, Pushpa Lallah, Dev Virahsawmy. <sep><sep> However, it is important to look at this list carefully because even if they do not have electoral power, they can still influence political decisions and even become book authors. <sep><sep> At the same time, Pakistani communists who were in power in Pakistan, were finding refuge in Afghanistan. <sep><sep> It is amazing how things have changed, and how Balram is shocked by the developments. <sep><sep> And you, when you think you are safe, with the Americans behind you. <sep><sep> And in the same sector, people are finding that the government is introducing Creole language. <sep><sep> This way the government can bring development for all people and ensure that everyone has work. <sep><sep> The political mastermind has concentrated on whether he has won or not won a car driver who has hit a person with his car on a roundabout in Sodnac. <sep><sep> It is only easy, because they have not specified what exactly they are talking about. <sep><sep> This battle that LALIT had already initiated seems to have captured public imagination and it will be very easy to build support at a regional and international level for such an initiative. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They could either predict what happened, explain what is happening, or propose no alternative to this disaster for the future. <sep><sep> Until today, they still find the anniversary of 9/11 and Maiden quite reasonable. <sep><sep> Yesterday we had a political party between organizations, today we are seeing the distinct nature of different political parties among their programs. <sep><sep> They managed to work one day, and set a second day goal. <sep><sep> * USE THE EURO FOR JOBS: When we released our slogan "Use the Euro for Jobs, NOT for Destroying Jobs", many things changed. <sep><sep> 40 minutes later, the soldiers say the police won't be able to come because they're too busy. <sep><sep> It's like a cauldron boiling, boiling, boiling. And, in contrast, repression is growing here, giving out bullets there. <sep><sep> In every corner, there's a "dagger" - a dagger of experience, people who would normally hesitate to act bluntly, precisely because they have already gone through the experience of acting bluntly and lost. <sep><sep> It was true long ago in Iran, then in Lebanon, Iraq, Libya, etc. <sep><sep> I guess anyone would say Diego has nuclear things, lots of pollution there, then he would say, he fires Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a challenge by the colonial government called a "challenge" during the period of the 2nd World War. <sep><sep> So it is a right according to the law but it is also a matter that you need to negotiate with your boss. <sep><sep> In the last 2 years, there have been several responses to oppressive class struggles, especially with people in different regions of the world, meaning the class struggle at an international level. <sep><sep> The youth are becoming more knowledgeable, so it seems normal in our society. <sep><sep> The problem is serious and is approaching a dangerous level. <sep><sep> Young girls used to go to work, and they would say "for makeup money." <sep><sep> Then they truly gave a formal response in Creole. <sep><sep> It explains our "systemic crisis" and the way this crisis implies a threat to the "historic block" in power. <sep><sep> We believe there should be more community services rather than imprisoning offenses that do not involve violence. <sep><sep> But, the role of the women's movement is to fight for the liberation of all women and for the liberation of society as a whole, from the burden of the dominant male system known as patriarchy that allows macho men to dominate with impunity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Argiman went to work like this, with all his determination: Hotel for the guests. <sep><sep> Scientists were realizing that change was beginning to happen. <sep><sep> All these beautiful points that have been raised up until now. <sep><sep> Even though it was Israel that perpetrated this atrocity against the civilian population, he did it with American money. <sep><sep> He started at 4:30 and was supposed to finish at 5:30, but with the interest the audience showed for this subject, he finished speaking at 6:15 instead. <sep><sep> The Chinese government will have to deal with, in the first place, this disaster. <sep><sep> For example, if we take the time from 1978, '79, '80, '81, even '82, where we saw the MMM, who in 1979, were a little bit behind a major demonstration. <sep><sep> So, the Government is acting too strictly, and too late. <sep><sep> It will pay a price for being a member of LALIT in Novam. <sep><sep> actions to protest against the military occupation of Palestine by the Israeli State, to protest against this shameful wall that is being built. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> but it is before any program that needs to reflect true workers' interests not only in the long term but immediately in the crisis we are today. <sep><sep> It's a very appropriate moment to start the law, refuse the poisonous gift from the USA. <sep><sep> After the "We Must Plant Food, on stable land" campaign, we have carried out a tractor campaign, and action in Parliament. <sep><sep> There are some who speak English or French or who wish to perpetuate a colonial system, taking a stance against it. <sep><sep> So the Government gives permits to export toothpaste, basic medicines, batteries, biscuits, soap, shoes. <sep><sep> I suppose it is important to have a UN organization that can testify in international forums on the manner in which Israel's occupation force is increasing its control in Palestine contrary to its commitment. <sep><sep> With the new development projects, all people were assured that the value of the actions would increase even more and if everyone stood by Bolema Holding in the Grobogan region, they would become number one in Gunung An. <sep><sep> In the long term, there is a proposal to use molasses to produce ethanol that can be used as an energy source to replace a portion of imported oil: <sep><sep> Because of this, he paid close attention when he had to say something. <sep><sep> And the crisis I explained, economic and social levels, did not spare the Union Movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Well, do we really need, from now on, to start putting our heads together in solidarity in the STRUGGLE, to challenge the exploitation by the bosses who control the land, leases, the hotel industry, BPOs, and reign through constant protection from the PT, MSM, PMSD, and MMM? <sep><sep> When we go to vote on the 3rd of July, we will be choosing 3 deputies to represent our constituency, to address our problems in the countryside, to ensure the necessary infrastructure development. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, just as the work begins, a member, Dev Virahsawmy, has resigned. <sep><sep> Come on, you need to say that you don't know who you are, what you need to do, where to go, why you're afraid. <sep><sep> But, despite the press boycott, we still went ahead with this important campaign. <sep><sep> Also, there is a penury of dollars in Mauritius, because all these investors are taking their money out, and it's in dollars that they're taking it. <sep><sep> "We don't want anyone who takes drugs near us," they said. <sep><sep> It is for this reason that Lindsey Collen has decided to thank: Ramesh for his extraordinary story on the Anna Table, Paul for his not too common methods that he has used to get land for vegetable cultivation. <sep><sep> And, it is equally valid there in VRAC, and here, on the table. <sep><sep> So, when looking at representativeness, isn't it obvious without a referendum? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said that he is considering the MVLF's request "favorably and seriously". <sep><sep> And what has changed is the political work that Lalit and other organizations have done; that's what has allowed this. <sep><sep> And it is a goal of struggle that all kinds of authorities were trying to stifle, senselessly. <sep><sep> There are reasons to say that perhaps there is an element of Lindsey Collen's sickness in it. <sep><sep> Hello Olivier, Anzie, Aurelie, Ti-Frer, and all GRC members. <sep><sep> We need to keep watch on 3 levels: What the press chooses to focus on, how it reports events, and what its editorials say. <sep><sep> We had discussed it in all our structures, how it is made public in the media, on our website, and through a reflection document that was internal and published (Get the article in Revi). <sep><sep> Lalit, along with other organizations, has adopted a plan for food security as a solution to combat the food crisis. <sep><sep> Balram had a piece of land where he was working on building a small house of stone, a basin, and more planting space. <sep><sep> Two members were unable to have a chat as one of them showed his passport and permit to show that he owned that land, while the other one showed his papers for a different plot of land. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is no longer into tourism, but instead, as in the last mandate, he is managing the funds of CSR for social projects to help less fortunate people. <sep><sep> In both protocols, you will find the presence of the British Government. <sep><sep> We cannot overlook this fact: similar to how the Intifada has spread across the occupied territories from Morocco to Yemen! <sep><sep> Even though this strategy involves counter-economic control and historical bourgeois monopolies, it ultimately aims to reinforce the capitalist class in its foundations. <sep><sep> Its structure (starting with scrutinizing political parties one by one, then analyzing their faults over time) worked well. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is important to remember that it is the economically weaker individuals (naturally with a few significant exceptions) who suffer, and among them, the younger ones who endure police violence the most. <sep><sep> Reduce the rupee devaluation by having the government take back control of foreign exchange from the private sector! <sep><sep> - If many workers have double membership (meaning they are members of two unions), and if each union has more than 50%, they each get "sole recognition"! <sep><sep> I am not saying that everyone needs a house. <sep><sep> If everyone deposits, then the NRB makes a proposal, the Minister approves it, and it becomes an Award, a Remuneration Order. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we have children, we may have to relocate ourselves. <sep><sep>One R. where we are living has informed us that The House also received notification to demolish some time ago. <sep><sep> LALIT has expressed its disagreement with EVM because it believes it has too much power to control the democratic process from citizens (candidates, voters) to the army of technocrats. <sep><sep> As the ideological differences between the authoritarian regimes in Pakistan and Afghanistan diminished, 'ethnic' politics became more centralised. <sep><sep> There was also a literary student group, which held its own and was present. <sep><sep> And among this group, young people were more likely than anyone else to maintain and practice it. <sep><sep> During the  election itself, he said, both day and night were found together, and we were not allowed to leave in the manner in which the polling itself was conducted, constituency by constituency. <sep><sep> His actions, if they continue, will become a dance, like a spy dance, like an informant dance. <sep><sep> Rev Lalit de Klas was released every month from November 1976. <sep><sep> There is another aspect where you need to explain the reason why you are making this request. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Friday afternoon, a group of LALIT members distributed flyers for the partial election in constituency number 3. <sep><sep> Now, there is also a concern for those who manage to pass, the dropout rate drastically increases. <sep><sep> So, clearly we have found that there are many different interpretations. <sep><sep> It is known that Aziz, every time he comes, brings a little gift for him. <sep><sep> He has made himself somewhat available to the great bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Lalit calls for an election in constituency No. 7 to vote in the blank ballot for the partial election scheduled for December 21. <sep><sep> In contrast, Jean-Claude Mahoun, representative of Sesel COI, has a stricter position. <sep><sep> There are specific conditions in a time where the government is making many deals over Cyber City and Cyber Island. <sep><sep> This figure of "36%" makes people forget that there won't be any protection after 2009. <sep><sep> Q: So, this political crisis in the Opposition, where will it end. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He mentioned that one day a Joshua will come to perform miracles, which will amaze people in their homes. <sep><sep> We had a serious discussion with CTSP, Jane, Reeaz, Anand as well, where he spoke. <sep><sep> It's somewhat like an Arabic version of Tawn in Rose Hill. <sep><sep> We have created the first Creole-English dictionary, which has been reprinted 6 times, 1,000 copies each time. <sep><sep> There was a first on the political situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan which helped us understand the complex situation when Pakistan became a significant player in geopolitics. <sep><sep> The new labor law by Bunwaree aims to make unions more "business friendly", fostering industrial relations with production and making unions promoters of productivity and efficiency. <sep><sep> Governments don't get elected for 5 years, they face crisis after 3 years, after 4 years they form new alliances. <sep><sep> In terms of information we can say: "The regime has established martial law". <sep><sep> Comrade Yves: Q: In Lindsey's presentation, I found it very interesting, the details he provided, his experiences, it really shows a different atmosphere of the time. <sep><sep> You were offered a ministerial position on a platter, and you refused it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that time, in IRC, the president had a candidate called Travayist. <sep><sep> And he also found a way to mention the resettlement of the Chagossians, or even to not mention any resettlement that had a USA military base on Diego (MBC TV 26 September 07). <sep><sep> But unfortunately, the union leader said, and we all had this experience, that when we had a disagreement with the union leader, puff, we were out. <sep><sep> His title in English is Against Communalism of the Best Loser System. It has a brown envelope with red and black inside and it is 232 pages. <sep><sep> especially in companies that were most profitable before, capital shifted from production to banks and finance (making money with money, instead of making something with money). <sep><sep> And when we debate here, I don't know if they know, but underneath there's a shark. <sep><sep> Capitalism is different from different systems before its time (i.e. before the 250th century) because it depends on perpetual crises. <sep><sep> The first thing in Toyko where Ragini Kistnasamy participated was a demonstration against Camp Zama on Saturday, 21 June, a base in a city located in Tokyo. <sep><sep> In a week, on the 10th day, there was a large, large demonstration. <sep><sep> After the elections, the Electoral Commission, checked the elected officials, one by one, looking at which community they were on their Nomination Paper. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Only the farmers have the right to harvest their olives. <sep><sep> An important moment in the meeting was the preparation for the 2005 campaign. <sep><sep> Just because Subron or Bizlall tells you to walk, don't walk. <sep><sep> He will address the gravity of the situation only if the program avoids at all costs the partisans of the program bring about a conflict that is otherwise regulated by a communal framework. <sep><sep> If there is a channel between the car and the truck, there are additional lemons to load the cane. <sep><sep> We had a slideshow and discussions that began to outline the neighborhoods in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Like how it was a Labour Government that cooked Diego Garcia and re-sold it to the US military when it was a Democrat Government under Lyndon B. Johnson. <sep><sep> And this system has faded away over 25 years, and in the last 20 years it has faced this without too many challenges. <sep><sep> There are also individual languages which find themselves in Academia today. <sep><sep> It has continued to develop and is capable of facing a systemic crisis, an organic crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "These Hotels that are scary..." Available in 14 bookstores in Mauritius and soon the book will be available in Rodrigues. <sep> <sep> Would their love have triumphed despite their differing ideologies that once made them enemies? <sep> <sep> Should we use it to make the establishment profitable or should we use it to develop alternative economies <sep> <sep> When the French zone is closing down, a majority of families are losing their jobs. <sep> <sep> (b) We must not rush into things so quickly that we either make a mistake or get ready to face our opponents later. <sep> <sep> Discussion topics: rice, flour, oil, sugar, and a piece of dried fish. <sep> <sep> Meaning a meeting held in a certain way that encourages participation: <sep> <sep> Actively involved in the SILU-UASI Medine branch, he participated in the organization of the Great General Strike of 1979. <sep> <sep> We do not want a society where the State imprisons us in the so-called "communities". <sep> <sep> You will know that there can be a classless society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the meantime, Gianee had gone to the other side of the river with her flag. <sep><sep> Pushpa Lallah presented the LPT publication and from Playgroup. <sep><sep> Maybe you knew that Aurélie Talate was bringing her light too. <sep><sep> With the Jugnauth regime from 1983, pro-American political will be developed and strengthened at an accelerated pace. <sep><sep> "In this important moment, we join our voices with the global movement to say: <sep> If anyone says I don't work on the land, what he's saying is I don't get up at 4:00 in the morning and go pick up the cane Mr. Lindsey Collen found the deep factors that provoke all these political realities. <sep> These technocrats can easily be "bought" by parties with money. <sep><sep> This publication was to expose the weaknesses that the MMM analysis represented. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, it was clear that the MMM had become a political force with its New Social Consensus that was trying to impose a policy in favor of the economic ruling class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To hide the gun in his small car at the back of the house. <sep> <sep> This propaganda of terrorism, which started to accelerate after 9/11, where under the pretext the fight against terrorism, countries like America and England. <sep> <sep> It is evident that the Lalit de Klas trend was not in line with the bourgeois press, because they do not fit into their agenda. <sep> <sep> So, what does it mean national unity, we see how the strike is going, we see where the weaknesses are. <sep> <sep> -Ellora Devoncourt, from Harvard, who was studying family in politics. <sep> <sep> When there is a crime in a family, a death, then it becomes the moment where one discovers at the same time a heinous crime, an event this man who accused him of abusing his children for a long time. <sep> <sep> Neville Alexander, who is in the Process for Alternative Education in South Africa (PRASESA) said that many people were saying "Parents don't want to learn in their mother tongue." <sep> <sep> So, when the USA is trying to withdraw from Iraq and also from Afghanistan because it is over-extending, Israel is creating a situation that keeps the USA in the Middle East. <sep> <sep> Since the financial crisis of 2008, capitalists have been trying to capture more land, especially through speculation on essential foodstuffs. <sep> <sep> MMM's strength is that it has more options in terms of moments. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And in these crises, every time they become severe, they threaten its capitalist existence itself. <sep><sep> In turn, this leads to a dialectical relationship with the ability to handle natural languages (or mother tongues). <sep><sep> Sometimes, the working class falls into the trap nourished by the petty bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Members of LALIT, Where is Zafon, take the floor in street demonstrations against the base. <sep><sep> In this approach to limiting either to the 2 blocks who want the executive, meaning there would be a total generalized complicity of the whole of the press. <sep><sep> It is this coalition PT-MMM, among others, that would be a preferred announcement for the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The Wind Turbine project would benefit from the dual advantage since it blows on Mauritius almost continuously from the southeast. <sep><sep> Our association is writing you to make a formal request that you give the assurance to the leader of your Party. <sep><sep> And this, mainly for two reasons for which we have already announced. <sep><sep> And here, we will find, with this first point I am making, that the trade union movement has fallen into a trap. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After that, Sithanen introduced version 2.0 called the "Additional Stimulus Package." <sep> In addition to the "private debt," the global economic crisis has reached around 300% GDP. <sep> How he got this new one, the man is furious. <sep> And finally, it's worth mentioning that everything we've done in Political Education over Port Louis, plus we've done serious things in Kirpip and another one in Flac. <sep> The Government has already allocated funding to the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority for this. <sep> This visit was very touching because it was a visit by a well-known society to support mothers and children returning to school on Tuesday. <sep> In LALIT, we have brought LALIT to replace BLS as part of a comprehensive electoral reform. <sep> As we find in the MID 'Green Paper', we do not have many land resources in Mauritius: <sep> The colonial government needed enough power to be able to control the working classes and social classes here. <sep> it's sad that he had lost his voice a little. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a certain sense, Rapor Rama Sithanen is quite minimalist. <sep><sep> He needs this influence in the State to operate, to exist. <sep><sep> It signifies a new form of institutionalized comminalism- intensified which is much more dangerous. <sep><sep> Effectively, Hotel owners are not hiring people outside the Hotel to work. <sep><sep> So, today, with the rigid Stalinist regime that was outside capitalism in a corner of the world, we continue today with the same process that already begun over a hundred years ago. <sep><sep> And this is how the story goes, and no one can deny that Timi was developing his family senses. <sep><sep> No, they haven't achieved what they were claiming in their deception, meaning the Bestluzer communal system. <sep><sep> It seems as if the IMF has gotten involved in this mess too. <sep><sep> The cooperative bank started financing plantation plans. <sep><sep> But only this actual start is being overwhelmed by some hysterical commentators, by irrationality, and even dangerous communal drifts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a sensation that does not allow love to cross barriers but rather makes the barriers even stronger. <sep> perhaps too many "members" come out of the USA and UK or too many participants are "away", in the Mauritian diaspora. <sep> -Workers, sugar workers and artisans in the fields; they also get lost in the fields and in the sugar. <sep> I am talking about the Line Barracks station, and its old wooden building. <sep> We say we need to let people who can develop a true modern agri-food industry for exportation (and for us to eat here) take control of the land. <sep> In 2011, there were also restrictions on the 6 para-state bodies financed by the CESS levy (a sugar levy) and the layoff of 400 workers who were working in these para-state bodies. <sep> He was a lawyer who had a lot of success in his youth when he was defending victims of human rights violations - victims of persecution, repression, and police brutality. <sep> What explains this is that he is gradually moving towards joining the government with the workers, in the end. So, it is not surprising that many young people, if they do not go further than that, feel "disgusted" with politics. <sep> There are groups that are aligned with this Law, which benefit from it and then become the political base, the social base of the MSM. <sep> But for Samazeste Toupoumwa and his band of followers, all of that was not important. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Our contacts with our publication, and in general, are directed mainly towards activists and militants, but sometimes we also engage with ordinary people. <sep><sep> But if you are in a party like LALIT, you can address environmental and ecological issues in a more political and broader way. <sep><sep> With MMM in government, policies to legalize the use of our own basic languages ​​like US Creole began to be officialized. <sep><sep> It said that the fact that the PT-MSM-PMSD government approved a Mauritian Creole Spelling Law in February this year is very important. <sep><sep> It was only if some readers could read Yousouf Mohamed correctly - a big defender of the Bestloser system - when he publicly said it. <sep><sep> So how did Navin Ramgoolam say to continue this process? <sep><sep> During the last ten years, Sanndia and Yosi lived a very orderly life. <sep><sep> Arianne Cavalot-L'Estrac announced with great pride, including a sting that "Le Sentinel is in good health." Le Sentinel (a financial group of L'Express) has expanded well. <sep><sep> Particularly, will we nominate a candidate yet or not. <sep><sep> In the last 2-3 weeks, the government has dealt with a serious Chikungunya issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the same time, mechanization and centralization in agriculture have accelerated, supposedly reducing production, but it is still once again the working class that is carrying the burden, to the extent that there is destruction of traditional crafts and livelihoods. <sep> <sep> But we must realize that it is not through the education system alone that we can transform society. <sep> <sep> Because it is a new concept, sometimes people are not listening to what we are saying. <sep> <sep> So far, we have not received a message from the Mauritian trade unions. <sep> <sep> It is a kind of demand that, when explaining why this demand is necessary, or developing an argument attacking patriarchal power. <sep> <sep> and Mr. Dezer, who the MSPA is giving the government 1,500 to 2,000 arpents of land, which reverses the contract for electricity supply to CEB. <sep> <sep> Where union bureaucracy and interest groups, in the absence of working-class mobilization, appear to find "strategies" such as a series of maneuvers, actions (or threats of action), and methods for bargaining with small-time traders in a sector under government control, or to "play" the forces of opposition against the government. <sep> <sep> It can be said that this "independence" should have no constraints. <sep> <sep> The lady feels, raises her hand in the air, dances, truly dances, cries out, "The only solution, revolution! The only solution, revolution!". <sep> <sep> The class consciousness has evolved quite well to even be here. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are not responsible for themselves, the value of patience. <sep>"I am in difficulty, I have not received a promotion, I am having difficulty in pulling rations, because I am in such a community." <sep> Many friends since the morning have been emphasizing how important it is now to make our voices heard on the issue of the Chagos. <sep> It began with the Arab Spring, which today appears to be less "spring" than it could have been. <sep> The book we are launching today is an analysis of reports of autopsy and medical reports that have been submitted in the case of the death of Kaya. <sep> The exhibition will be set up from 3:00 pm for everyone to visit. <sep> There are several ways to do it, and one way to do it is to restore economic growth and create jobs, but also to restore your dignity. <sep> These new forms of organization in this new strict power structure can take all kinds of forms: <sep> An old lady who was very happy with Jamouna because she always had a kind word for her neighbors, stood by their side, said a prayer, looked at her face like she was fixated on a saint in church. <sep> 8 Auntie Bagya is not really an aunt, but everyone liked Kamini as a second mother, more like a spiritual mother who always helped her with her chores. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They cannot be compared to the past, when all prisoners were eligible for a pardon, even if they were locked up for offenses involving drugs or sexual violence. <sep><sep> He spoke about the failure of traditional approaches to propose a rational plan on drugs and addiction. <sep><sep> The Economic and Social Crisis Union Movement has brought about a decline in the trade union movement. <sep><sep> However, these two forces, according to Lenin, are not enough. What is necessary is a well-democratic organization that expresses the ideas and aspirations of all its members who agree, and which is also centralized enough to understand the complexity and plan and coordinate actions. <sep><sep> Some said that they believed that the democratic process had ended in failure; that the Prime Minister had lost his footing; that he hoped that no disaster would befall everyone. <sep><sep> Human rights organizations in Palestine are using this tragedy to remind the world and armed forces to prevent Israeli colonists from terrorizing Palestinian farmers. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen were present to express solidarity with LALIT. <sep><sep> And the same way where to change Best Loser . <sep><sep> Even the bourgeoisie itself would have preferred to have a counterpart in a Ramgoolam government, as Berenger often offered to act. <sep><sep> To start, perhaps it would have been better if we critically analyzed the elements we find new in this current time, especially international elements. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But if we are in LALIT, we only form, rally around them, but when people discover the truth, they will abandon us too. <sep><sep> we have listened to every member present give their reactions on whether it is important for LALIT to nominate candidates or not for this election, and yes, what quality of service they believe they can provide. <sep><sep> The proportion of electricity produced by CEB is decreasing year after year and the thermal power plants in the sugar industry as well as other large private enterprises such as Gamma-Coventa and CT Power are also entering the electricity production market. <sep><sep> In one of her articles that did not directly respond to what LALIT said, Bizlall chose to defend the "poor" Subron; while, when she issues a call to a long list of union members to gather for an alternative. <sep><sep> Or the police preventing a person from leaving the country until he repays a civil debt, this also goes against a country's sovereignty apart from its creditor. <sep><sep> And the way they do this is simply by deceiving people. <sep><sep> If you want to go to a movie, and want to find, contact the nerport members. <sep><sep> The fact that there is neither press nor union bureaucracy united in the struggle (against exploitation) has not helped to better understand the crisis, but has worsened the crisis. <sep><sep> You will find that Marxism has become (or rather REST) relevant. <sep><sep> Finally, a moment has arrived where they have entrusted us all to speak to them about their issues. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For the past 2 years, we have been conducting a campaign on the land issue in the country. <sep> <sep> A defensive battle, meaning we defend the rights here. <sep> <sep> This means that within 2 years, the security industry can implode. <sep> <sep> The Gazette Le Cerneen, for example, started with the compensation money paid by the British Government to the slave owners, especially the security oligarchs, who will then free their slaves. <sep> <sep> Just like what happened in Yugoslavia, and how they managed to gain independence for Kosovo recently? <sep> <sep> Clearly, it is an offensive to penetrate Mauritian society. <sep> <sep> And those tiny islands Diego Garcia and Chagos, their situation is quite challenging, complicated, with all kinds of gaps. <sep> <sep> There was just another commemoration, where nobody came to tell the 71st grievance. <sep> <sep> Following the results of the municipal elections, MMSD joined PT-PMSD to become the Kirpip Municipal Council. <sep> <sep> It shows everyone who is fighting on the Chagos issue for many years now, a completely legitimate reason. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, he mentioned that the new Prime Minister is closely monitoring the re-introduction of Muslim Personal Law. <sep><sep> So how will he be able to help us address some of the issues related to Health, and prepare us to face the possibilities of a collective listeria outbreak in a simple Public Health problem: <sep><sep> Unionized workers and para-state employees are holding small meetings to discuss the Manraj report on the PRB. <sep><sep> He dug a number of small canals to water almost everywhere in his plantation and in a very central orchard he built a large reservoir and in his reservoir there were crescent bread, crescent sounds and tilapia. <sep><sep> There was no right to plant any type of plant except lopyom for the British to sell with Lasinn. <sep><sep> 2 Can you look for Ble-Blan-Ruz again, that is the Social Alliance plus MSM together. <sep><sep> And how some changes have been necessary, that is to say, some defects because in some defects there are also many things to learn. Why didn't the big strike in 1971 start on kicking out the repressive government that put POA, IRA and has sent elections? <sep><sep> There is also a spacious barn covered with a cane roof and open on four sides and with other 3-4 feet. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam appointed Rama Sithanen, a technocrat, an ultra-liberal economic policy defender as Finance Minister, and also as a counterpart. <sep><sep> and localized concerning the golf course on Liloserf or more recently the Botanical Garden, and they were received by environmental NGOs such as SPACE Vanille, ECO-SOUTH, Nature Watch who condemned just some issues, before disappearing. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After Barcelona, we decided to start a regional organization. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the National Remuneration Board was regulating the pay and working conditions in different sectors. <sep><sep> At the beginning of this EraA, it was the way the government was regulating trade unions. <sep><sep> Most importantly, 25% of the poorest people in the country during the lockdown found that, when they had rationing, they were eating better than normal. <sep><sep> We found that the trade union movement sees this as a right for trade unions to access private insurance, gain privileges in private clinics. <sep><sep> But in reality, they are in a tactical alliance with Shakeel Moahmed, Nita Deerpalsing, & Co. to gain certain advantages in different sectors, corporatist advantages. <sep><sep> Now that he was outside active politics, he had a lot of time for the thirteen children who became his own drinkers. <sep><sep> Basically, when the planters revolted against dominant politics, the Gridi Krazkor Government dug a canal on one side of a mountain, a thousand feet deep all around to the top. <sep><sep> The transition led to amendments to election spending (without the UN sanctioning more transparency in funding for political parties and accountability in relation to voters who voted for a specific political program without falling under the pressure of capital lobby groups). <sep><sep> The Lalit activists participated in several debates on the radio, whether in political debates on Chady's resignation, partial elections, general elections, or on legislation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, pull a massive truck, distribute it all over Mauritius. <sep><sep> In the last 1 year, the government is responsible for the devaluation of Mauritius by more than 20%, and this has led to an increase in prices cascading. <sep><sep> At one point, workers have stopped getting transportation to work. <sep><sep> it's not a concept invented by LALIT, it's something that happens every day, in all workplaces, especially since the downfall of LALIT. <sep><sep> Terrorizing them physically and psychologically, with threats, they come and start near where they live with threats and insults. <sep><sep> It just needs to fill in a few sections of the worker class with him, as if he represents their deep aspirations. <sep><sep> Now, Navin Ramgoolam begins announcing that this land that the government is asking the establishment to use is not just for social infrastructure, but also for agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> He has Sun Trust money at his disposal to start an electoral campaign. <sep><sep> And so, the people, like one person now, not as a worker, they are far away from the system, they are alienated, because they have prevented it from having an interest, there is control over what it produces. <sep><sep> dictating what American and European politics are in Lebanon, Iran, in the region? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes Fatma used to show signs of tiredness but never said no. <sep>
<sep> Each Council takes care of security, health, education, minister, sports for the inhabitants in the block. <sep>
<sep> They are addressing questions related to the role of banks, insurance companies, investment companies, stock exchanges. <sep>
<sep> And now, we are faced with the fact that capitalists are buying environmentalists. <sep>
<sep> If we give humanity 100,000 bananas, approximately, in all of our history, there are only 5,000 bananas where in several places have served as the starting point for different social classes. <sep>
<sep> Obviously, we all know the social reality, all workers have to struggle - whether through their union or in other ways, but always fighting for wage increases, and sometimes just to be able to get their salary. <sep>
<sep> Our new website is doing well, and we have more visitors than before. <sep>
<sep> Lindsey Collen said that in the past, when the economic and social crisis hit, the working class developed its political movement to represent its own interests, that is, a party which, as a result, was independent from the bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> Faced with weak politics and the Government and Opposition, the dominant political forces, they manage to gain influence only through various initiatives. <sep>
<sep> A representative of Lalit said that the issue of "Sixth Form Colleges" is a tactical issue, not a principle issue, while what interests Lalit are the means to re-evaluate all levels of schools and colleges. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ashok Subron's reaction to this is that it is a "logical" decision. <sep><sep> We expected the 3 planted trees to have grown back since their removal. <sep><sep> He does not represent any particular social class, and when this happens, too often, what he represents is what is the strongest. <sep><sep> In the last 2-3 months, some gossipers appear to be discrediting themselves systematically. <sep><sep> When the hyper-liberal pressure cooker begins to leak, it spills everything. <sep><sep> Then, why is this important, if he stops going to the law for rights, it is absolutely normal then if you are demonstrating, he can shoot bullet at you. <sep><sep> The first time a high-speed tussle took place between MMM and PT. <sep><sep> Jim Cummins: 2000 'Bilingual Children's Mother Tongue: Why is it important for Education?' has shown that there are more pedagogical advantages when instruction is done in the mother tongue. <sep><sep> After the sound bomb and temporary checkpoint at Hares' entrance, the Army left the scene. <sep><sep> The Lalit Party chose Labour Day for the launch of its publication, allocation of a symbolic day off for workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> F. showed us the view and the school corridor from the balcony, a large empty space where there are no olive trees. <sep><sep> They say that even though they know well that country after country is blocking exports, so Madagascar and Mozambique are doing the same when there is a shortage. <sep><sep> This way we all develop a knowledge and appreciation for this relatively new form. <sep><sep> We know how the US secret service usually infiltrates social media and organizations through donations, training courses, undercover work, and other methods. <sep><sep> However, in all of this, they do not agree with a word about what Zidisyer has finished telling. <sep><sep> Nann and Fatma went outside to wait for us to arrive late. <sep><sep> At that time, in 1979, Vacoas Transport, when it arrived in February, could not make the payment. <sep><sep> They, for example, neglected the Chagossians when they landed in Mauritian land, and Madam Edna Menes explained this well. <sep><sep> But the person who made a concrete call for a 5th International is Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela. <sep><sep> If the press mentions Raj Dayal in the election, this could introduce a new element into the debate of the bipolar paradigm. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He begins to favor not to write to Diego, because Diego may not be able to write him back since he is busy with his mom like a migrating bird: but here are birds without any security issues and a miserable peace. <sep><sep> In general, the boss in his classroom wants to increase discipline (he calls that increase “productivity”), he is happy to have everyone present on time, there is no absenteeism. <sep><sep> And we found that, when the communal firemen have enough work, then they regroup in the Vigilance Committee to offer fire prevention training. <sep><sep> Tamby's letter is finished; they are all working; Samy is running our company as a boss. <sep><sep> Many friends have brought out that the bed cannot be brought here. <sep><sep> We understand why Ramgoolam chose not to discuss this last point! <sep><sep> Felix, that is the owner, the employer, the boss, even if just by 20%. <sep><sep> There is someone calling Cyril Jacques Monty who is in charge of the Diversification office in the Chamber of Agriculture, who comes to talk about agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> He acts as a guardian of US economic interests in the Middle East, a region where 2/3 of global oil production is located. <sep><sep> In October 1978, Jean Claude de L’Estrac, then assistant general secretary of the MMM, was even expelled from the Reunion colony because he spoke in favor of Reunion's independence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the Arya Samaj gathering, Navin Ramgoolam congratulated Nando Bodha, saying that he is the greatest leader of the opposition in history, and he poses the question in a very poised manner. <sep><sep> There seems to be an attempt to destroy the homes of the Palestinians in the mirror (I think this blockade on construction permits in the latest article of TO may be relevant here. <sep><sep> These Endo-Creoles, as their leaders seem to understand the importance of organization and education, were able to avoid the mistakes that the Afro-Creoles made. <sep><sep> What struck in 2004 is the many struggles that have consecrated them as political classes for LALIT to know as the main political force that has put them on the agenda. <sep><sep> It is astonishing because it is precisely because of the military bases that the Chagossians have suffered so much, it is precisely because of the military bases that all Chagossians have been exiled from their homeland. <sep><sep> But often, as I have said, while the bourgeoisie of the state is developing old-fashioned bourgeois conflict. <sep><sep> This kind of action, when combined with a well-defined public strategy, has the potential to mobilize and equip support in favor of the struggle for the liberation of Chagos-Diego on the level of Mauritius, the region, and among the people scattered around the world. <sep><sep> When father Mohammed asked the soldiers where they were taking his son, they threatened to beat him and his son physically. <sep><sep> When we arrived in Hares, there were school children going home. <sep><sep> He transferred ideologies as a tool of the state in an individual and group context in a social situation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And as if we had this proper analysis on "systemic crisis" and "historical block," as if we had this analysis on the balance of forces between historical bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, we would have a lot of difficulty understanding. <sep><sep> When you know the reality of a checkpoint, you can campaign against it better. <sep><sep> When there was this Public Forum where LALIT was also on stage, we were waiting for Berenger, for MMM, and Arvind Boolell, for the Workers, to use all kinds of arguments to praise their comrades. <sep><sep> During 22 hours, Gaza residents made the world cry more intensely. <sep><sep> But, here we come to an important point of my speech. <sep><sep> So, when we finish this mockery (like we had sent Comrade Rada to do in the first session, and he did it in a fantastic way), we must also move forward. <sep><sep> This is symbolic, because you need money to make this essence, it also represents hard work. <sep><sep> Nazim Essoof, for L'Express, then conducted an exclusive interview with Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> Either Jugnauth represents rather a Bonapartist State, meaning relatively independent from all classes, including the bourgeoisie, and even if he reigns in the interest of the bourgeois. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the Workers' Party, almost throughout its long history, has been part of it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes, I, and other people here, we are not in the Political Bureau. <sep><sep> So, this type of control over our way of thinking must be exposed, for us to escape from this control. <sep><sep> Negotiation sessions of the new Economic Partnership Agreement and Leros represent a threat to textile and fish exports. <sep><sep> There would also be an announcement of a government decision to change the name of the Grand-O-Bonaventure Municipality to the Timi-Tinny Municipality and make Tinny a donating citizen. <sep><sep> So you might have the possibility for the first time of social inequality. <sep><sep> If all this party acts in a similar way towards workers, it is obvious that workers need independent force. <sep><sep> Israel receives 40% of US foreign aid, especially the most sophisticated and destructive military equipment available. <sep><sep> Mr. Monty is not just an agronomist; he was head of the agricultural diversification section at the Agriculture Department, in 2008. <sep><sep> Likewise, we say his response was hysterical and thoughtless. <sep><sep> They are experiencing more severe symptoms without questioning the causes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It concerns large concessions on taxes, large-scale loans for interest on debt, as well as direct subsidies from the budget, and regulations to impose fees or tariffs, or increase them. <sep><sep> When Paul Berenger made his first speech, he said that Radio, Cartoonists and Editorialists are creating a bad "perception" of reality. <sep><sep> Regarding the dispute in the transport sector, LALIT has deepened its contacts with transport worker unions on different sites through strikes and then through our own sites. <sep><sep> In this electoral campaign, Ashok Subron, he too has benefited greatly from numerous media appearances, lots of photos in the newspapers, he is well-known. <sep><sep> So, all these 3 things are together a sign of the crisis, and a cause of the crisis. <sep><sep> -New industrial law and labor law to make employment 'flexible' and easy for layoffs. <sep><sep> Meaning people are eating a lot more processed food these days, and almost everything is imported. <sep><sep> Vote for LALIT's critical representative, distributing leaflets in various neighborhoods and getting ready for the challenge to come. <sep><sep> And what does a capitalist have more than anyone else? <sep><sep> I said to him to not denounce all the weapons, because there are weapons that are much larger than those of the Palestinians in this peaceful war. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The tears did not stop falling in Marda after the visit to Zedi on 2nd September. <sep> A black cloud hung over his thoughts. <sep> On Sunday 2nd September, Lalit organized a debate forum at Windsor Rose Belle College in the context of our campaign for an Alternative Economy. <sep> The PT-PMSD regime was losing credibility not just among the people. <sep> You may recall in our headline we said "Down with the imperialist FAKE NUVO". <sep> This is the course Paloma takes when Diego is in the lead. <sep> It wasn't a week-long shower anymore, but a heavy shower. <sep> Both of them had feelings that they were put on Earth to do God's work, to help their people against 'others' and against the 'threats' that only looked out for themselves and never thought of the well-being of the little people. <sep> It is special because the imperialist jails and colonies are increasing. <sep> Now, I feel like I have become a pawn in the employer's army on one side and a pawn in my own colleague's army who use me for their own interests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are seasonal jobs in the sugar industry in the areas that have reopened, as before 1964. <sep> <sep> It is not enough to just find a few corrupt policemen. <sep> <sep> LALIT challenges Minister Bunwaree to act on the basis of the findings of the LPT. <sep> <sep> We have prepared together with other organizations a press release convincing. Effective must recognize the Palestinian state, and give diplomatic status. <sep> <sep> We need to know what LALIT is bringing us, and where it will take us. <sep> <sep> not only for spying, but also for military attacks against other countries. <sep> <sep> In the name of LALIT, it evaluated where the political campaign for an alternative economy has arrived. <sep> <sep> It seems difficult to be in LALIT, but it is challenging, passionate, and you feel lively by understanding what' happening consciously. <sep> <sep> Then, they all came together, played brinkmanship, looked at who could cost more in the abyss, made their comrade more afraid, and now they will think, certainly, we must stop this game. <sep> <sep> Even in satin sheets, all the children were lost like that. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The PRB issue has not been resolved yet, awaiting the report from the Manraj committee. <sep><sep> The chief trade unionist is converting all workers into trade union members, just like before 1964. <sep><sep> There used to be among the youth council two or three members who would accept an alliance with Team Timi and work under its leadership if the majority of the state members agreed. <sep><sep> It is an unacceptable method in a political party.” Meanwhile, it is clear in this article that his resignation was due to the democratic vote that took place in the assembly of members, where he found himself in a minority. <sep><sep> He was an intellectual who was considered a failure when he finished primary school. <sep><sep> There were meetings between Berenger and Ashok Jugnauth where Ashok Jugnauth was presented as the opposition leader and possibly as the prime minister instead of Pravind. <sep><sep> Until Mauritius risks returning to the "Poor Law" period like in England, where government inspectors come to check how many cases of poverty there are. <sep><sep> After everyone was taken to Solomon, they were brought to Peros. <sep><sep> For example, the concert was based on 5 demands, where artists, political activists, and associations were campaigning against violence by government officials. <sep><sep> Until he has an AAA rating, which means he is almost guaranteed to be able to pay off his debt, but if he misses a payment, then he will lose an A from it, and his interest rate will have to be increased. So, it's quite dramatic. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Has the PMO's 'task force' on Chagos reflected on these proposals? <sep><sep> We have observed the Gokhool Reform in different aspects of students, parents, and teachers. <sep><sep> There is a sense of occupation in Reunion, and in Mayotte, which France has been cooking since the Comoros. <sep><sep> Furthermore, over the weekend, Berenger has regained many points on a basis that now appears common, being supported by the Gregoire assembly. <sep><sep> The media is making believe that a party like LALIT has not achieved any success. <sep><sep> "We want to build a network of strengthened bilateral relations between Britain and Mauritius that can act as the veins and arteries along which trade can flow in both directions so our two countries can grow and prosper together." This message from William Hague, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain. <sep><sep> JUSTICE, then, has increased resistance that was already there, and as we said, there was often a lot of "indignation". <sep><sep> Together with this, there was a private sector that was quite discriminatory in its recruitment for employment. <sep><sep> The press is publishing all kinds of things, so the Prime Minister responded by saying that he "will not tolerate this." <sep><sep> Against the 1% dominating America, dominating the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is also important to emphasize that it is particularly a section of the police force that is involved in violence against citizens: the anti-riot police section responsible for dealing with demonstrations, offenses, and crimes. <sep><sep> For 10 years, during all this centralization in Mauritius, the beneficiary license, which was previously closed without any compensation, has been paid. <sep><sep> When he took a pro-Sithanen proposal position, he altered the semantic nuances. <sep><sep> At such a moment, the morality that was once iconic in the capitalist ruling class lost its legitimacy. <sep><sep> However, today, the government of Mauritius can no longer hide behind the legal strategy of the Chagossian Refugee Group. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the state is making mistakes: the planet is in danger. <sep><sep> For a yes, for a no, I feel sick. <sep><sep> Either someone speaks the same language (with regional variations) as another person, or they speak a different language from another person. <sep><sep> He uses the languages of PLHDWU and PMSD as a referent, the base of MMM, MMM people, establishing a new union in the labor force, PLMEA. <sep><sep> The commercial ideological content is something we can understand if we remove different influences, step by step, but which are always present at the same time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The major sectors where militants from the 1970s were recruited. <sep><sep> So, its place in proportion to its political importance has greatly diminished. <sep><sep> The bi-ERA is to resolve disputes in direct relationships between trade unions and employers. <sep><sep> Shareholders are very picky about how their work is done, whether they receive a dividend for their shares, they are satisfied. <sep><sep> Moving the Rich Terre planters to make room for Tianli without Tianli's project taking off. <sep><sep> Here, RIOT has started a riot, started trapping, beating. <sep><sep> Could be a problem for Resilience, but a big problem for CNT work. <sep><sep> 3. We have learned that environmental issues must become an absolute priority. <sep><sep> He argues that under new law, all disputes must be settled by collective agreement. <sep><sep> However, in countries like Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, there is a party like LALIT, and their role there is to integrate with, get involved in, this constant confrontation, as much as possible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One day Timi went to his small apartment that Samy has arranged in the annex. <sep><sep> Legal Aid used to apply only when you go to court. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy, who chaired the discussion forum, said how there was a well-established tradition of discussion forums in the 1970s, and how Lalit continues this tradition today. <sep><sep> In this crisis context, we are making a series of proposals. <sep><sep> Syndicates that are already federated will create another federation to gain power. <sep><sep> If we look at the changes in the trade union movement between different periods, we have a lesson: <sep><sep> And, it also explains why trade unionists are now enforcing the Employment Rights Act and Labour Act, which the Labour Party has implemented. <sep><sep> In the last budget speech, when there was an economic crisis, it was said that we should, economically speaking, look towards China, towards the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China). <sep><sep> - Do you agree with them? - I believe that they have the right to live their lives as they see fit. <sep><sep> and to write in English, use the mother tongue for speaking and initial literacy, then switch to English for writing, use the mother tongue and build English language proficiency in schools and at home. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They put a man with a tie on a big board, looks very proper, children behind him, ladies applaud him, correct. <sep><sep> So, when he sings, it brings satisfaction to all the audience. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie felt the need to have its share to represent its political interests. <sep><sep> And this created a problem for building union unity in the '70s, because there was a large union that was affiliated with a political party that had anti-worker policies. <sep><sep> At the beginning of the year, LALIT introduced Electoral Reform into the agenda. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega, we had a colonial government. <sep><sep> - 'What's happening in our country? Have you heard they killed someone in a police case?' - 'Killed someone? Who?' - 'That's right, as they call him here, Fanfan, Fanfan Tabardenn.' - 'They killed Fanfan? Where have you heard that?' - 'Everyone is talking about it. <sep><sep> When we say demand, we don't find it to be the same thing as a claim. <sep><sep> Up to now, there is a great tradition in France called "secularism", "laicity", etc, which is still in the memory of many French people. <sep><sep> how to demand a firm military base with lalit to stop invasion wars, occupation wars. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then why do you think it's important to have a press, you can't predict the press here? <sep>
<sep> We left there, and where there were many economic activities, in a space of one year, we entered his encounter. <sep>
<sep> Surely Top FM also has links with it, but we don't know. <sep>
<sep> But when we started publishing the Review of the CLASS, friends who participated in the publication had a very hard time. <sep>
<sep> The Lord took the floor to announce that his office, which was responsible for the safety and well-being of the population, had eliminated a dangerous terrorist threat that claimed that God had two sexes. <sep>
<sep> The result also shows that the Labour Party, through its deductions, has an absolute majority. <sep>
<sep> I remember a long time ago when Berenger used to like to say that MMM at the time had a "conflictual working arrangement" with the bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> Marx and Engels in the Manifesto said in their first sentence; "The history of all societies is a history of different wars between classes". <sep>
<sep> Namibia Conference of LALIT was invited to participate in a socialist organization conference held in Windhoek, Namibia. <sep>
<sep> Yesterday we believe that they really are against the Best Loser System, even if they make contradictory statements. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Along the coastline, the white sandy beaches that stretch from one end to the other have become an ideal location for the tourism industry. <sep><sep> Despite the government favoring a capitalist system, it continues to maintain the capacity for the same ruling class, namely the bourgeoisie, as it is a colonial government. <sep><sep> Moreover, a general strike was proposed on the 10th of December, Human Rights Day. <sep><sep> A debate has ensued between Gilbert Ahnee and Mr. X. <sep><sep> For example, we have conducted protests, to express our opposition to the system. <sep><sep> For the International Human Rights Day, Ramgoolam announced that there will be a 30% quota for women in Parliament following the Electoral Reform that he is championing. <sep><sep> Then, within our Association, while we have been fighting and continue to fight against police violence, we realize that the government is always responsible for perpetrating torture (it almost has a monopoly on torture), and it consistently does not enforce laws against torture. <sep><sep> However, within his personality, he had a certain characteristic, such as a tool that occasionally becomes both a weapon and a shield. <sep><sep> Where justice has a vacant seat and a military institution is holding the other. <sep><sep> I hope that I am able to convey the heroic struggle that unfolds in Palestine today - the struggle of the Palestinian people, as well as the heroic struggle of activists and militants within Israel against the Israeli government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the protective veil of European protection, from 1995 onwards, and after economic diversification in the areas outside the control of historical bourgeoisie, this sector (sugar) no longer reigns the same, and may no longer be able to reign at all in its former form. <sep><sep> What Eddy said that made me laugh, naturally we all want a revolutionary punishment, but there must be revolutionary patience. <sep><sep> Yesterday, in the future, we must analyse the scandal that needs a "moral certificate" for different jobs. <sep><sep> Raddhoa even mistreated Ziz Seetulsingh and the NHRC on the Radio in 2005. <sep><sep> We seek support from people based on the program we defend. <sep><sep> A dozen students who have completed their literacy basics to follow this course. <sep><sep> * All public transport network - buses, services and regulated Palestinian taxis by the Checkpoints. <sep><sep> When the international bourgeoisie faces a new major crisis, it is important to prepare to act quickly, although everyone will be watching. <sep><sep> There must also denounce anti-worker, anti-trade union and labor laws. <sep><sep> For all these reasons, it is important to take courage, act according to your own conscience, and vote for LALIT candidate, Rada Kistnasamy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However in general, it becomes mandatory to eat this with it. <sep> <sep> He explains to us how, in time, the distance in meters, affecting the children's rights in Palestine for education. <sep> <sep> So what is Ashok Subron's personal strategy in the trade union movement? <sep> <sep> many people face difficulty in understanding that there is a market that exists because, in comparison to the past, the legal market did exist. <sep> <sep> Do you know that Mauritius Constitution still seems to be marked by our colonial past. <sep> <sep> - My father and I will go and talk to him in his dream. <sep> <sep> Then another group of people want a challenge. <sep> <sep> This can mean a decrease in the price of tobacco, and the ability of Mauritius to sell tobacco to the German company is affected. <sep> <sep> In 2011, we established the Mauritian Creole Academy (AKM), which started in late 2010. <sep> <sep> Secretary of Health and Immigration Services: has connection with the company Philip Morris Inc. (a major tobacco production company). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To return to MSM in general, now, most importantly?<sep><sep> What is happening is when dictation is given, then there is democratic rule, and Islamist rule is also free.<sep><sep>Social class, according to Marxist economics, is determined by the relationship a person (more precisely a class person) has with the production of all the things we use.<sep><sep>There was too much at the time but it's another story.<sep><sep>PT-PMSD government, together with Dev Virahsawmy, year after year, for example, have nationalized Mauritian Creole on ?Zurne Langaz Kreol? and has ultimately created a Creole Festival which is not just for the nation but is also a tourist attraction.<sep><sep> This year popular committees that started the fight against Miray chose 1947-2007 lalit kontiyne, liberasyon pu vini as their slogan.<sep><sep> There were three speakers: Ram Seegobin who introduced the Gokhool Plan for education, deaths in detention and how Lalit weaves these debates sometimes punctually.<sep><sep>And he is a Pandora's box, as he has been said, on the day when he, once unlocked, doesn't know what quantity of different things are in there, which you hadn't foreseen.<sep><sep>While there is a President, and also a Minister of Finance, two key posts.<sep><sep>This pain was a mystery against the stomachache he would get every time he got his checks. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the American colonies revolted against England, they unfortunately used religion as one of their ideological justifications. <sep><sep> Vidya Golam has shared at what point this book became difficult for her since the first page. <sep><sep> But, it appears that it is a “fey”, a “natural”, almost “divine work”. <sep><sep> Another issue that concerns us deeply is a concept called "social alienation". <sep><sep> The launching discourse was made by Vinesh Hookoomsing, Acting Vice Chancellor, University of Mauritius. <sep><sep> There were also very moving testimonies from political activist Ragini Kistnasamy, who was a young militant who went through this great student movement of 75. <sep><sep> As it is today, there are details about public sector spending. <sep><sep> This community called the 'General Population' has been given a special status for the first time and becomes a community very much focused on equality and other different communities defined in the Constitution. <sep><sep> He has gone as far as abusing MTUC's hospitality in union attacks. <sep><sep> Paul O’Neill, Secretary of the Treasury Department: has connections with ALCOA (the largest aluminum producer in the world), International Paper, Lucent Technologies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As I am making preparations, when I read articles on the issue of "nationalism", it allowed me to understand the problem a little better. <sep> When Lindsey Collen and Ram Seegobin met Jean Claude de L'Estrac, he told him that the article was blocked. <sep> (Full discourse by Ally Hosenbokus on the news section of the Lalit website). <sep> All those vague propositions were aimed at a "rebalancing of power between the Prime Minister and the President". <sep> On the other hand (while acting as a parasite, living off the domination and exploitation of its fellows). <sep> Don't worry,' Kamini said to comfort her. <sep> I say our relationship with the labor movement depends on what stage the class struggle is at, why? <sep> It must, as a party, take a position in favor of decriminalizing abortion, in favor of contraception. <sep> But, political, social, and economic events in the last 20 years have started to introduce a flu-like strain into the minds of many who now need a sofa to sit on. <sep> The Alliance Sociale government, on the other hand, has a security-driven economic policy. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is worth mentioning, the way in which LALIT has developed its proposal is also democratic. <sep><sep> directly financing NGOs and individuals, increasing the number of scholarships for Mauritians to study in the USA. <sep><sep> It is not like other countries where you have to go through 'security' checks before you can enter. <sep><sep> They have nuclear weapons in a place where there are no nuclear weapons rights. <sep><sep> If one woman falls, another will stand up for her. <sep><sep> There are poems from every different era, with different sensitivities. <sep><sep> Some members had a nationalist position, like Kautsky and Bernstein, who were leading workers to enter the camp behind their fathers. <sep><sep> While today we live in a barbaric society, where the State (whether it be Bérenger, Ramgoolam, Jugnauth) defends a capitalist voracity that acts in their own private interest. <sep><sep> -It is the party program (its class analysis, its transitional demands, and its will and capacity to promote it). <sep><sep> On Tuesday, March 6, when we paid tribute at the Western Cemetery in Cassis, and in Bwa Marsan, to 2 women who died due to illegal working conditions, Marie-Noelle Derby and Sharonne Marla. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They take advantage of their position, in this neoliberal era, even after 2 crises, it always ends with the effects of their operating in cartels, where they themselves decide how much interest to grant. <sep><sep> If America uses its veto power in the Security Council to block a resolution proposed by Abbas, it should not be surprising that no one will protest in front of its embassy in most countries and precipitate further diplomatic isolation of Israel. <sep><sep> But, the class consciousness in England was sufficiently developed so that the first union reaction, they do not agree with the secret ballot. <sep><sep> After Bolema Holding became number one in Gondwana. <sep><sep> I also explained about the issue of land, the price of sugar and how to produce ethanol in Mauritius. <sep><sep> And here, they are not really, according to the press, "sitting" in the National Assembly; they are rather sitting to seize power to "execute" a policy that has never been subject to democratic political debate. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, on behalf of LPT, made a forceful speech. <sep><sep> Strengthen the Kimanyer party so that we can organize our political activities, especially as an organization, and at the same time keep an eye on recruiting new members, strengthen branches, and diversify our political activities. <sep><sep> One of them was feeling a sense of tension and sadness. <sep><sep> Ah, the MMM proposition, proposes the nomination of 30 Deputies from a pre-established list before elections, where no candidate other than the Leader will be in the election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> PMSD, a political party, lost the 'Independence elections' in 1967. <sep><sep> Other dynamics, other leaders, are continuing, are in place now. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin was also on Radio Plus last Saturday in the opening program with Rihun Hawoldar (Labour Member of Parliament). <sep><sep> He also talked about different healthcare systems for taking power; health systems based on voluntarism such as the experience in Cuba with the CHE and Fidel Castro, spontaneous movements such as the student revolt in 1968 in France and Popular Fronts as in Chile. <sep><sep> It often happens that the capitalist class suffers defeat when at the same time the working class is not yet strong enough to take power. <sep><sep> Kate and I went to check if they were going to school. <sep><sep> It is in this context that AGOA has become an important springboard for the bourgeoisie, especially the local historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> It doesn't focus too much on explaining a revolution, meaning analyzing the forces that have the potential to overthrow the current system. <sep><sep> The PT/PMSD government is on the defensive and discredited, but it has a fairly decent majority, with 3 defected deputies from the MSM. <sep><sep> and there is a commission system, such as the education commission, the Diego commission, the gender commission and also the youth commission. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that God had agreed to this arrangement, according to the elders' thoughts at that time. <sep><sep> Today, the UK and USA have completely discredited the Diego issue. <sep><sep> But, we find ourselves, on the threshold of a crisis, with rapid radicalization. <sep><sep> He has promoted the Kreol language as a writer, educator, linguist, publisher, and MMMSP activist. <sep><sep> If in the 1970s, we had said, "Let's not create divisions between MMMSP and LALIT, and the LALIT," then our LALIT today, would not have existed. <sep><sep> For this reason, we refer to this strike as a degrowth movement, not just a strike like all other ones. <sep><sep> They are also corrupting parents, by arguing that parents must have "either-or" choices. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah also explained how the current law allows a Magistrate to indirectly conduct a confession to the police as evidence, without really having a case. <sep><sep> There was also a memorable program where Ram Seegobin was on a panel to pose questions to economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz on MBC TV: <sep><sep> The Education Minister continues to push for the vote on the Local Government Bill in Parliament despite the growing grassroots opposition to this anti-democratic law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The education system has sustained the political and economic system at different times in society. <sep> <sep> It is currently analyzing society among different communities representing percentages. <sep> <sep>  In five minutes, Mr. Minis would step into his distinctive and serviced world on that day. <sep> <sep> To this end, a Renewable Energy Development Authority must be established, not only focusing on the establishment of its energy coming from cane (bagasse and ethanol). <sep> <sep> There were several human rights activists present to monitor. <sep> <sep> It was announced that Lalit will present in a press conference our actions and proposals to contribute to defusing the crisis and bringing progress for all children in education. <sep> <sep> Currently, the basic salary is only Rs 2,700 and it is becoming more difficult for Floreal Knitwear workers to face this series of basic salary increases. <sep> <sep> Recently, the bourgeoisie and the government have continued with an accelerated development in the tourist industry, with 12 new hotels in Kalimater, at a time when the number of tourists visiting Mauritius is not increasing. <sep> <sep> But it is an anonymous bedbug that shines. <sep> <sep> Small islands were melting like ice in the sun. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Nowadays, it is clear that as time goes by, the global capitalist system does not hesitate to use its military power to force populations to shoulder the burden of its failed economic system. <sep><sep> If we encounter security problems in the country, such as high theft rates, we can install anti-theft devices in our homes, set up sensors, monitor the entrance of people into our neighborhoods, and this should eliminate any issues. <sep><sep> Proudhon, in a way, is like a Robinson Crusoe for socialism, even though his way of seeing things, his character, his vision, seem strange to me. <sep><sep> The Socialist Alliance has implemented an economic policy that has forced workers to bear the burden of all the crises that have occurred; systemic crises in the security and textile industries, energy crisis, food crisis, financial crisis, and recession. <sep><sep> Throughout the years, there have been conflicts between these two ideologies. <sep><sep> It is a question that challenges the capitalist system itself because the capitalist system is incapable of providing what it claims to offer. <sep><sep> This means that neither one can offer a solution. <sep><sep> The National Assembly (Retiring Allowances) Act provides for all ministers and elected officials to receive a pension once they have completed two terms. <sep><sep> Since January, the third book of the Education for Workers series has been launched. <sep><sep> This speech was made at the Company Garden on December 8 in the context of celebrating Human Rights Day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The central discourse was delivered by Vidya Golam, who seemed to say in this first literary competition organized by LPT that they were producing a poem for that occasion. <sep><sep> But facing this, working people have only one weapon which is the union, which is a collective force where all workers come together and establish an organization, they are members of that organization, they own it. <sep><sep> Starting with the victim Kan Marie-Noelle Derby, a press photographer who died in 2009 due to illegal work, we also started with her family. <sep><sep> her pension in this case is 2/3 of 121,500 which is equivalent to Rs 81,000 per month, for life. <sep><sep> When "information" is a moment where it talks about a serious, formal, clear, and precise issue. <sep><sep> In 1978 there was a factory strike at St Pierre called Maurice Knitters Ltd, where the boss decided to increase the workload. <sep><sep> Participants present have realized the strategic importance so that there is an articulation between the 3 pillars of the Chagos heritage, namely the decolonization of the Republic of Mauritius, strengthening the base of Diego and the right of return for Chagossians. <sep><sep> One of the 2 reasons why we left the MMM in 1982 is because we believed that the MMM had betrayed its own commitment in the anti-communal struggle with its alliance with Harish Boodhoo. <sep><sep> While in 2011, 10 million people were affected by famine in the region of Southern Africa. <sep><sep> The state here has a relative autonomy compared to the other states. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, this matrix, it's a year-long construction. <sep><sep> The individual solution, where one says "Wow, life is getting difficult, if I have any sense I'll go to Ireland." That's not the solution to the problem. <sep><sep> *Public space: Through radio programs, articles in the press, press conferences, demonstrations, press releases, legal actions, we have also changed the balance of power in the public, or at least begun to change it. <sep><sep> Lalit is appealing to workers, trade union members, and all progressive forces to ensure that an amended Constitution gives workers the right to strike, and to ensure that the IRA penalty does not affect the worker's rights. <sep><sep> It was a session for people interested in using cartoons in the political awareness process. <sep><sep> The experience that marked him was when a group of twenty policemen arrived at his house at 5:00 in the morning and arrested him. <sep><sep> At every establishment level there had a Brans konzwen SILU-UASI. <sep><sep> This is a sector that has known the most growth where imports are concerned. <sep><sep> And, at the same time, we, chiefly we, we were in the MMM, a tendency to appeal to the Vanguard Working Class, or the "Class Struggle". <sep><sep> We have to do the work, to convince people that the progress we've had in the last 30 years is the progress that will take us further. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Trustees were Aneerood Jugnauth, Sarojni Jugnauth, Ashock Jugnauth, Pravind Jugnauth, J.Jhingree. <sep><sep> There were also discussions on how intermediaries between agriculture/fishing were taking advantage: there were instances where a man who sells fish twice as expensive to a fisherman he bought from. <sep><sep> For example, it is believed that the hotel awards a contract instead of bidding for certain services it does everything itself. <sep><sep> This kind of law represents a serious problem for women, because it is a regression since progress has been made through "secularization" of the law. <sep><sep> On Friday, Ram says, he talked with a journalist about the explanation for the broken vote, and the journalist finally seemed to understand. <sep><sep> And Berenger even made the commitment as President of SADC, with 2005, that there will be 30% of women in Parliament. <sep><sep> Not just work here, in institutions, but a series of small merchants make it. <sep><sep> As you know, Great Britain asked for a goal for Mauritius, meaning about a dozen islands that form the Chagos Archipelago, taken from our country when we were gaining Independence. <sep><sep> We are coming forward with a series of proposals for electoral reform, party financing, and a code of conduct. <sep><sep> No leisure time: there is a branch, which took over part of Lalit, a Central Committee, a political office that operates on a rotation system of members of the central committee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If we wait for people to take action by themselves, forget it! We need to go see people, we need to recruit people, we need to interest people. <sep><sep> On 16th September, he was on Radio Plus on a track that Lalit had taken on the political and social crisis in the country. <sep><sep> What strategic differences did you refer to in such an approach. <sep><sep> Who will take care of the house when Timi goes? Is Balram not getting married because of the inheritance his wife would receive when his father dies? The man spoke on the porch. <sep><sep> Towards the creation of a true movement that is ready to develop, defend, and advocate for alternative economic and political programs that Lalit is proposing. <sep><sep> There have been no White Papers or any documents inviting the public to make proposals on what kind of regional democracy system is needed. <sep><sep> In the past, the PMSD was known as a true defender of the private sector, especially the security bourgeoisie, it regroups an elite bourgeoisie and a franc city worker on the basis of its communal politics. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, it has been announced that Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth will not do as he announced a thousand times before, on the 28th of March, but on the 4th of April. <sep><sep> But CT power is a Malaysian firm, and this is not economic democratization. <sep><sep> In his budget, Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth unveiled an unprecedented attack on pension rights. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Well, the Government has started with buildings and lakes, some of them inappropriate and old. <sep><sep> Ramgoolam wanted to shoot it, replace it with proportional representation which the necessary best loser communal ticket. <sep><sep> The second book, which was launched last Friday, is a book written by Mark Frew. <sep><sep> The crowd was shouting meaninglessly: "Kill the vermin! Burn the vermin." The guards then went to Princess Prathna's room to lay siege to it on the wooden fortified wall around which twelve ropes had been wound. <sep><sep> Then the bank started giving free money - They had extra capital so it wasn't being used up - so that he could become a small entrepreneur. <sep><sep> Its "letid" rating came before France lost its 3A Standard and Poors rating, meaning all of France would have to pay even higher interest or the country would have to borrow money from elsewhere. <sep><sep> There is no international organization that can offer a form of coordination for these different movements. <sep><sep> In their meetings, they recruit among trade union members and delegates who may be able to develop a vision, or even already have one. <sep><sep> Then in business, buildings, there was a problem. <sep><sep> R: All workers had been silent for so long that bureaucracy allowed it to continue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Education for Employment initiative has facilitated a communication on the occasion of International Mother Language Day 2012, celebrated every year on 21st February. <sep> <sep> The EDUCATION FOR EMPLOYMENT program has been launched for the first 5 years, and on strategies for the next 2 years after that. <sep> <sep> We have a better understanding of the implications of the different measures taken by various governments. <sep> <sep> There is a concern about a new wave of VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme), as prices are expected to drop after the WTO Court Decision. <sep> <sep> Boodhoo has a flair for acting when there is a critical situation, like the one we are facing now. <sep> <sep> This is how they make a confession, resume their roles, and work diligently "marse". <sep> <sep> There is a woman who used to work in a hotel before becoming a housewife. <sep> <sep> The Partial Elections in Number 8 was exactly one year from now, exposing the total degeneration of the Mauritius election system, and its rapid advancement. <sep> <sep> Today, the government is finally addressing the issue of the Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS), with certain elements included. <sep> <sep> You cannot buy decolonization against a British passport. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MMM-MSM document also clearly states that the PPP process for integrating capital budgets as well as recurrent budgets is to better manage public spending. <sep><sep> And there's my friend Kisna who will provide context today, to finish this paper. <sep><sep> But there was a slight hesitation when it seemed more nervous. <sep><sep> It affects the social class of property, it must have stability. <sep><sep> With the new report on our language, because of the history of repression that the Creole language has gone through, a report that we, as Creole speakers, have our mother tongue with us, by this somewhat unfortunate story. <sep><sep> How was his reaction when he started the Empowerment Program, with its main activities: socially marginalized legal assistance (i.e., it does not address the 25,000 families without housing). <sep><sep> He was also a founding member, and one of the conceptualizers for a health society, a health cooperative, the Bambous Health Project, which for 25 years, organized preventive medicine, consultations, blood tests, and courses in anatomy, physiology, and pathology. <sep><sep> There have been, in those 40 years, some major speeches. <sep><sep> Our score in 2005 has varied a lot, between 0.7% and 3.6%. <sep><sep> Greenpeace is an environmental organization, it has its part in this issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, the boss also wants a New Republic, and that represents a dance in a moment in history when there is a balance of forces in the current class struggle, when we are asking to change the Constitution for a 2nd Republic. <sep><sep> For over 5 years, LALIT has been campaigning based on our program for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> When a scientist in England studied the impact of genetically modified potatoes on health, he conducted experiments with rats and observed that consumption of GMOs decreased over 3 weeks. <sep><sep> This is because there are all kinds of incentives for transporting carbon, etc., which are not part of the establishment's plans. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen talked about Education for Workers. <sep><sep> This is true especially for customs regarding marriage, inheritance. <sep><sep> After its revolution, it set an example for a country. <sep><sep> I will tell 2-3 short stories to show the role of the State, or maybe 3-4 short stories, depending on the time. <sep><sep> * On Quarawa Road, we got off the bus to take a taxi train to Biddya. <sep><sep> He said that what struck once again is the absence of social alliances, that his own candidate, Raj Ringadoo, who had a case against Ashok Jugnauth but chose to remain absent when the election came. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we read this life, we understand the many attempts made by state institutions to hide the truth. <sep> <sep> In the Cassis region, the government is granting the company Lend a large land lease for 99 years. <sep> <sep> The sugar industry was already using bagasse to produce electricity that they use in the sugar factory. <sep> <sep> Sometimes we think that with this new generation comes a new mentality but unfortunately the brief remains the same. <sep> <sep> On Tuesday, 21st October, there was a gathering of poets and fifty-year veteran poets of Gran Rivyer organized by the Education for Workers. <sep> <sep> The press conference was held in contemporary context. <sep> <sep> now we are not like this." But, in LALIT, we are choosing to commemorate the 79 uprising because it is the biggest uprising that has ever happened in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> The international capitalist economy is an independent, powerful reality. <sep> <sep> 3 out of 3 deputies were elected as well as all other constituencies. <sep> <sep> In the face of the systemic crisis that Mauritius is going through, PT-PMXD is encouraging workers to go to work abroad, even if hesitating. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, Tuesday 10th May, several speakers took the floor at a successful meeting held by Lalit in the Atlee Site, Forest-Side. <sep> <sep> Unfortunately, mass repression appears to be accelerating, which the Minister of Tourism has brought against all activists in the country. <sep> <sep> It is a class analysis based on objective reality in Mauritius and takes into consideration the fact that in Mauritian society, for historical reasons, there is an articulation between social classes and communities. <sep> <sep> You will hear from everyone that "go see what Percy Mistry said". <sep> <sep> Under pressure from our campaign, Minister of Agriculture Boolell has launched an Action Plan for Land Deprivation. <sep> <sep> -  'I don't quite understand your political stories but I think you men are all crooks. <sep> participation in central activities, and the idea that has taken root in their minds which then became LALIT. <sep> <sep> Organizer Jameel Peerally said, in response to the question "are politicians invited?" <sep> <sep> We describe the current situation, where the economic, social, and political situations are and where it seems to be going. <sep> <sep> We are willing to cooperate with the Americans there who are against any attempts to break this silence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Rs7.3 billion will be used for 4 main things: to support the private sector, to provide contracts for major infrastructure projects (such as the Harbour Bridge and Metro Leger), to maintain a government reserve to prevent overspending. <sep><sep> Me, Julienne, I had already put SMF on notice!" He was happy to tell that, he somewhat regretted, but what to do? <sep><sep> Mohammed's father explained that he and his wife were sitting in front of the door when 2 military jeeps stopped and asked if he had a 17-year-old boy. <sep><sep> He must prepare a Resolution that largely supports the re-unification of the country under the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> In the socio-political phase, through the Fraternal Organisation During the 1970s, there was a phase that we can call "socio-political", where the Chagossians mobilized to make their voices heard. <sep><sep> I must express my appreciation for the work done in the 1970s, especially when I read the Lalit Class Reviews. <sep><sep> Mother Tongue: Must be used as a medium in schools, in Parliament, and in the minutes of the Association meetings. <sep><sep> It is a fitting occasion today for us to pay tribute to those who have also contributed significantly to the production of this newsletter, especially other artists: Ram Seegobin, Lindsey Collen, Jean-Claude Bibi, Tony Lee To Lun, Family Commission of Lalit, and LALIT members. <sep><sep> And Menwar as a commentator, in this history, a Menwar with his full concentration and total conviction. <sep><sep> There are countries where the "extreme poor" have also been surpassed, such as in France where they have the "immigrants' class". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In favor of divorce by mutual consent, as proposed by the Law Reform Commission. <sep><sep> The Day Laborer was among the initiators of a movement called "No U.S base" and has successfully brought up the issue of Diego Garcia during meetings at the World Social Forum in Mumbai last January. <sep><sep> And at the same time, that is, in the year 2004, the Military Court reached its verdict. <sep><sep> Here is the time when the MMM-MSM documents are announcing their coming: <sep><sep> We have been developing our reflections on the Court in the context of a political strategy. <sep><sep> I've taken a dispute, if SMF stays vigilant vigil, which will upset and confuse everyone like Raddhoa, all of them! <sep><sep> Especially in the Nursing Association and GTU since the '80s. <sep><sep> Time after time, the media rigorously constrained their airtime in a "duel" between these two corrupt, morally and politically void figures, tied to the parties Ptr and MMM. <sep><sep> But, more strongly yet, it may be Finance (The Bank, Insurance drawing profits in billions each year, on people's backs, but also on the backs of other capitalists.) <sep><sep> Today, we may forget that triumphalism, as it no longer seems so relevant, because when the crisis in the capitalist system struck, the triumphalist ideology collapsed completely. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to visit more articles on working conditions, starting from the site. <sep> Despite the short campaign, we feel prepared for the campaign and all LALIT militants in various branches are well mobilized for a successful campaign. <sep> In 1973, there was a Food Crop Committee established with government-manual supervision led by Sir Claude Noel. <sep> However, we were just a moment, a cycling, a tendency in MMM. <sep> For example, Rajesh, for instance, said that they were paying operation rights with great confidence. <sep> This political stance is supposedly pro-capitalist, and the movement that contests the status quo must abandon political terrain, as well as economic terrain. <sep> During 3 months of heavy rain, the water did not cross. <sep> Ahmed Khan said that what the Communists have managed to convey is popular belief. <sep> He wanted to know if there are bananas in Mauritius and if there are several varieties. <sep> For instance, on 2 November, there was a seminar of LALIT that entered well into political matters. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> From the results of the WTO Tribunal trial, Lerop doesn't have the right to engage in "dumping" with this exemption. 

Obviously, they had thought they would win 4 cities. 

And if the majority is made up of "Mauritianists," it could be a common community except that it is not common, but a fifth community, there may be malicious intentions.

His dream is to form a team with them on a clear project, but he knew that this was almost impossible. 

2 days later, they found his body in a special cell of Shin Bet in Megiddo Prison, Israel.

1. He strengthened the class workers' organization, rather than the class. 

They forgave President Jugnauth his personal exit into political land from the start of the campaign. 

When a respected friend is giving us advice to consult a lawyer, we can rely on him, tell him everything, “Let's go now.”

But, what's important is that we contacted the Organization of Artisans' Unity (OUA). 

Bérenger also took an initiative on the Chagos issue, under political pressure, where he threatened to bring the Blair Government to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Time, however, when it is not possible, it is simply impossible. <sep> <sep> They say that he even swallowed a fly with his sunglasses. <sep> <sep> So, the police got a second place, not just from the government treasury. <sep> <sep> A place has the same text that writes Danger Mines, it also has its Hebrew version. <sep> <sep> They are coming with their workers and there will only be a limited number of lamp posts that they will offer to Mauritians. <sep> <sep> What would have happened the next day, what would have happened next? How would they have prevented the situation from deteriorating? How would they have prevented further destruction and death. <sep> <sep> The Mauritian met with the Cernian to bring a campaign for Independence in the '60s. <sep> <sep> The "Documents" section of our site for this introduction that has just been uploaded. <sep> <sep> At the same time, LPT is among the pillars that have been and are continuing to promote the mother tongue of the people. <sep> <sep> When the water starts to flow from a canal, the punishment is visible from under a single roof. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, and up until now, there has been a lot of controversy between the MMM and MSM regarding the responsibility for the defeat in the general elections. <sep><sep> He is organizing an association for families affected in Palestine and in Israel. <sep><sep> One day Princess Prathna and Yosi came together to announce that they had decided to go meet Yosi's father to present him with her future husband. <sep><sep> He said that the militants in Afghanistan are fighting against US occupation, but this does not mean that they are supporting the oppressive regime in Afghanistan. <sep><sep> It is a government decision, meaning a political decision, to invest in converting the defense industry into a sugar industry, making it profitable. <sep><sep> It is sad to see Paul Berenger, who himself has been a victim of this kind of repressive and dictatorial regime, repeating history today. <sep><sep> It is no coincidence that there is no boss who supports this Platform. <sep><sep> He analyzes Miray and what it means for the youth. <sep><sep> He has identified more problems of police violence than are mentioned in their resolution. <sep><sep> Because a government, when it is oppressive, its Minister of Labor and Human Rights, it only has to sign a paper and then there is an accident or a person from the PTr is given a 20-acre plot of land in a geometric way and he pays a location. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, Lalit leader Alain Ah-Vee told us that a 14-year-old boy from the village of Falamya had "disappeared". <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen described economic crises in Mauritius and Rodrigues: there is a lack of jobs, layoffs, and instead of being re-employed, people are getting into the process of becoming unemployed; <sep><sep> But in 1983, 1987, and 1990, what did the MSM ruling class do (in terms of class divisions)? <sep><sep> Regarding the First May Movement, Jack Bizlall started the last mile, in March, by announcing that he is "auto-demolishing" the First May Movement. <sep><sep> So, these ten different pressures are converging heavily on everything released in the newspapers. <sep><sep> Through cases like Brazil, Thailand, and Australia, they have turned against the WTO, threatening its future. <sep><sep> We reject all communalist ideas that seek to make a language the property of one or another section of a strong population. <sep><sep> Thus, in terms of ideology, it is not as clear-cut as we might think. <sep><sep> Some are even presenting the Creole language as opposing Oriental languages. <sep><sep> In many villages, residents are uniting with their organizations and are mobilizing with the support of Israeli and international activists to demand the dismantling of checkpoints and military bases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have enough evidence to say that this type of economic development has been fragile and inefficient since 1983 and more recently in the 2005 general election campaign, we proposed a program for an alternative economic policy. <sep><sep> We have the ability to conduct campaigns in our mother tongue, and we have the time. <sep><sep> And this kind of policy, they have a network in MBC and the press. <sep><sep> And, to cover up the foolishness they are doing, editorialists have recently been spouting a series of execrable banalities. <sep><sep> There is a JUSTICE Program, which was created 10 years after the death of Kaya and Lemet which was provoked, a program created through the mobilization of victims, prisoners, families of deceased individuals, through their testimonies, through lawyer analysis of the methods used in torture, through understanding the impunity of the State, and the way professional and intellectual coverage is done, and how victims are ignored. <sep><sep> There is an article in the book by Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen, for example, which exposes the foolish analysis and strategies of the MMM in 1978 that were trying to "take control". <sep><sep> So, despite Paul Berenger being used to hearing the silence of intellectuals in the country who are afraid to criticize him, he clearly threatens the Opposition with repression in his first New Year Discourse. <sep><sep> We advise against all travel to the area of Burkina Faso north of Bousa. <sep><sep> We are all one class of people called "Mauritian," we are all in "one nation, one people." <sep><sep> Partial reforms are coming, general elections may be coming, and the economic crisis is very serious. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The textile sector continues to thrive, with access to European markets for textile products in Mauritius. <sep><sep> So, that was my main source for this paper, as well as "L'Histoire d'une Trahison" which LALIT published in 1987. <sep><sep> There was an arrangement where preferential duty-free access was granted to textiles from 50 developed countries, a scheme that lasted until 2009. <sep><sep> Once a month there would be a formal branch meeting where two members would come from headquarters, and other sympathizers were also invited. <sep><sep> - Dad, I can't leave you alone here. <sep><sep> In 1990 G. Duval was against the MSM-MMM alliance to make Mauritius a Republic. <sep><sep> In terms of social welfare, there are NGOs that have taken up this land a lot nowadays, and they are often funded by employers. <sep><sep> He has been working in Zin since 2008 for 5 years and 2 months. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, there was a major seminar on agro-industry, a good initiative, but we don't see that the Minister of Agro-Industry, Arvind Boolell, has the political will to make this development a reality. <sep><sep> It doesn't start in reality, it starts in time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He did not even show sympathy towards the 400 workers who lost their jobs. <sep><sep> Therefore, for this reason, it was not a strike like others. <sep><sep> Among them were Marie Lisette Talatte, Charlesia Alexis, and Louise Latouche. <sep><sep> If that means "inanimity", then we need to go back to our dictionaries, as Ram Seegobin stated. <sep><sep> Against Alteo and Omnicane, there are accusations of diverting water that does not belong in the river. <sep><sep> No one even thought it was possible, no one was even thinking about that. <sep><sep> Another comrade, Vijay, has raised another very interesting point, on CT Power. <sep><sep> Karl Marx said something simple: “Get economic results.” He said "Get objective reality." <sep><sep> What work, on the other hand, will keep everyone in place? <sep><sep> MSPA raised another point, a point that we in LALIT found amusing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Let us note that the claim that brings us forward. <sep><sep> We are in a time of demobilization, a relatively strong working class for the moment (for other reasons, regarding threats, technology replacing workers, capitalist globalization, etc). <sep><sep> It is necessary to produce a single product for exportation and then import all the food the country needed. <sep><sep> And at the same time, the Dollar crisis is showing a second contradiction in the US economy. <sep><sep> If it doesn't have this list, from the Nomination Paper, it clearly can't operate the best loser system. <sep><sep> With their proposal, will the allocation for internal regions go to Form 6? <sep><sep> It is not because society has evolved since ancient times. <sep><sep> So many plantations have increased greatly, and even those who are in conflict with unions, with mill owners, they depend on low-interest loans for their development. <sep><sep> The government is persisting with fragile sectors such as tourism, the Zone Frans, BPO, the finance sector, and the security and defense industry. <sep><sep> We analyze this type of experience in a way where we learn (ourselves) as militants. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The worker has "work" in its name, but for a long time, it has represented more than just the working class. <sep> Even if plan L'Estrac seems very successful when we see him now, we must remember that he was talking during a time when Paul Bérenger had just admitted on the radio (with much courage, according to us in LALIT). <sep> He resigned as President of the Republic after refusing to give his consent for the Prevention of Terrorism Act, POTA. <sep> And Navin Ramgoolam's desire for more power is consistent with what the bourgeoisie is also seeking. <sep> In FPU, in the past, there have been many discussions about the connection between political struggle and trade union struggle. <sep> Kamla preferred to pretend it didn't exist. <sep> Here in Mauritius, they are looking for it in a twist. <sep> There are reasons and causes behind the "problems" in Mauritius. <sep> Among them, they praise themselves for having successfully reintegrated Rehana Aumeer and discuss the necessity for people in Mauritius to resist and act like the "Indians" in Spain. <sep> We are presenting the speech by Imran Dhanoo (Centre Idrice Goomany) which was given in Eta de Lye that LALIT organized on the 1st and 2nd of November 2011. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the 2010 electoral campaign, the "MSM" members who had joined PT and who were more prominent in the government of the Alliance Sociale, such as Sithanen and Gokhool, had to leave. <sep><sep> When Didier Robert brought this proposal to the table as SIT's representative, he immediately seconded the motion. <sep><sep> A revolutionary, he is someone who wants change, but he also needs to have patience. <sep><sep> Lepor puts GWF under an ultimatum: either the other executive members control Subron, or Sindika Lepor will leave. <sep><sep> This means that they cannot take a loan for social security, military pay, or any other expenses. <sep><sep> Workers believe that their problem is an individual issue they have. <sep><sep> "Face to face with the current imperialist: The Party, The Program, The Working Class and Internationalism". <sep><sep> This is a special power struggle that is quite common in Mauritius. <sep><sep> It's time to support the struggle for the Chagos archipelago in the US and the UK. There is no duty to unite all Chagossian groups for a greater mobilization on the Chagos issue. <sep><sep> If it seems to be "protecting" the worker, and sometimes it truly does protect the worker, it's because the balance of power is so skewed in favor of the worker that for their stability, they must compromise. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kim Jong arrives at a workers' class that mobilizes and unites. <sep><sep> LALIT condemns the attack by the Israeli army on the "Peace Flotilla" that was bringing aid to the blocked Gaza Strip for 3 years.<sep><sep> We need to face this fact that too many people are not employed permanently anymore; the majority are working irregularly, doing odd jobs to make a living.<sep><sep> When Saadi got cancer and the doctor gave him a good chance at living, Samy got a rude awakening. <sep><sep> Whether selling her body in prostitution, which she is a woman or a man.<sep><sep> Dinesh Ramjuttun even said before he was fired that the MBC is too biased towards the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> The strategy is based on the fact that there should be a 36% reduction in price. <sep><sep> Besides Bukharin in the USSR, there were Vavilov and Vernadsky. <sep><sep> The press is asking a single question: "Who wants to gain power or keep their power?" And he wants to say between these two blocks that only, don't do anything if you don't discredit it enough. <sep><sep> The trial was presided over by Alain Ah-Vee and Rajni Lallah, and a University sergeant was registering and filming. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I am a poor sailor, the big waves have decided to give me a score of zero. <sep> After they finished with Mrs. Soornack, they are attacking the other Ministers one by one on similar matters. <sep> We will also hear from Alain Ah-Vee who went to protest against the killings in Palestine. <sep> So it is also important for the government to say that there were "democratic consultations." <sep> Even though some continue to call it ‘New Labour’, it brings together many former members of MMM, MSM, and other parties. <sep> What I propose to do is to look at these two alliances present in this election: One to become the government, one to become the opposition, until, we don't know who is who. <sep> Workers are becoming more miserable, according to Sithanen, he says he is cutting a lot like the Finance Minister. <sep> There is no common vision, there is no common strategy. <sep> Although it started too late compared to the licensing environmental problem, Maurice Ile Durable contains analyses and programs that are important to review in the early days. <sep> It may seem strange that there is interest, in an electoral period, for a similar program, but at the same time, it should be noted that the concept of an extra-parliamentary opposition is something well established in the political tradition of Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here, during a workshop, Cindy Clelie and momem, learned how they found and defined a Party militant, and also how they act so that they can recruit during a "downturn." <sep><sep> And forget the sugar cane bagasse and ethanol, the establishment itself is saying that this will not be enough. <sep><sep> Its rights have never been so relevant, as before. <sep><sep> In these areas, its clear faculties in all university sectors in the world, are taking the capitalist system as a "gift," are not questioning it, when the capitalist system threatens society and threatens the planet. <sep><sep> Only in this moment, the army has been used as paper. <sep><sep> He says that this model will help transform the Security Industry into the Energy Industry, the Energy Industry which will enter into the production of ethanol, the production of electricity through bagasse and the production of white cane sugar. <sep><sep> The only way out of this is to go west; go to the city, go to Lérop. <sep><sep> 1987 - we had set up a platform with OMT-FNAS and this was a disaster. <sep><sep> Who will win the contract to remove this carbon? <sep><sep> We are not in this organization, nor in its manifestations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And like this, there is not much room for the gods to get involved in this matter; society itself creates the law. <sep><sep> Nadja Rakowitz explained how a movement like ATTAC (especially in Europe in the last 10-15 years) believed and made others believe that the capitalist system could only be attacked by attacking a weakness, that is, financial capital. <sep><sep> Ton Kade, Auguste Follet, Kuppan, and others lived. <sep><sep> Today I am with a heavy heart in my mind because I am reading the latest UNODC report from 2011, which shows that our country, Mauritius, has been dubbed the golden gateway to Africa. <sep><sep> -Our campaign has also started to put pressure on Government policies and establishments. <sep><sep> Women present found that the women's fight will be more successful if opposition and resistance undermine the losing system, namely, the patriarchal system, which, if there are reserved spaces for women within such a system, must be disrupted. <sep><sep> Everyone has their place and everyone must know their place and respect the place of others. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, our children do not remember yesterday, they live in a permanent today and refuse to look into the future - because for them tomorrow does not exist. <sep><sep> It is not this age where we go looking for girls and boys to marry. <sep><sep> Israeli planes (which America has given them) have bombed several neighbourhoods in Gaza, regions with the highest population density in the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We must put Angolans and Americans away, we must reunify Mauritius, and we must compensate all Chagossians. <sep><sep> A flu that on one hand is doing "one people, one nation," "Mauritianism" which has made people believe that we are all in the same boat in Mauritius. <sep><sep> But, it's so serious that the opportunity was slowly disappearing. <sep><sep> The fruit eater was not eating its fruit too greedily. <sep><sep> And in its turn, there is a risk of becoming a form of communalism through lime. <sep><sep> Then other sectors will see how the burden is being lifted, and at a certain point, if SILU-UASI is in the security industry, it will need a helper. <sep><sep> If people agree with our program, our strategy, they are in the LALIT. <sep><sep> Today, we all have access to a wealth of documentation, a collection of unique and invaluable tools that LALIT has, starting the debates whenever there are differences of opinion, more access to knowledge gives young people more assets to build their arguments and increase their knowledge. <sep><sep> For producers and planters, this is a good thing, it is natural in the capitalist system, whereas for consumers, it is not just bad, it is serious in a similar moment. <sep><sep> And we have circled it well in the country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, a situation has arisen where there could be an abolition of social classes. <sep><sep> In their complaint they explained the problem of how the Resistance and Alternatives party received in the election, how the balance has not been disturbed by its technical calculation for Best Loser. <sep><sep> In 1976, more than 35 years ago, when many teeth here started to intervene at the political level, we started a publication called 'Revolution of the Class'. <sep><sep> First of all, no one wants to give up arms, but to rebuild the country, we must go into a unique battle. <sep><sep> He said that in cases of violence, the DPP can and should investigate further into Laws. <sep><sep> Omar was a good mixture of Raman and Aisha Bibi. <sep><sep> Because the IRA makes illegal complaints, it brings bureaucratization to the union where all problems at work go into the Board, the Court there, instead of looking at it at work where the worker is strongest. <sep><sep> And to spice up everything, for the first time in the history of a Ministry of the Republic of Mauritius visited Diego. <sep><sep> In other words, a State that will properly dominate individuals and society. <sep><sep> Before it was like a "freeze", what it means to extract. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There would have been a Rima and Auguste Follet. <sep><sep> In a press conference, Lalit Alain Ah-Vee stated that Lalit will be present in all constituencies for the upcoming elections on 3 Ziyet. <sep><sep> He, when describing this, he wasn't a militant by chance, he was a philosopher, he was working in the university department. <sep><sep> Mama Gaia who gave birth to clay, her stomach was burning with pain and sorrow. <sep><sep> Sometimes there are two feet, and sometimes there are large rocks. <sep><sep> A lady around fifty-years-old was sitting next to my head. <sep><sep> She doesn't see them as people who are going to participate in the class struggle. <sep><sep> If you don't have a political program, you have a lot of energy to resist all sanctions. <sep><sep> "Our only political program today is to visit a more free and equal society," Alain Ah-Vee concluded. <sep><sep> Good agricultural land is being cemented in an irreversible way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The relationship between MMM and MSM, each week the relationship has worsened. <sep><sep> They believed you would be given a confession in private, you would come out with a conviction. <sep><sep> He also mentioned that poverty, drug problems, and prostitution are issues that do not only concern individuals within a religion or community, but concern individuals affected by these issues. <sep><sep> Clearly, it is for this reason that today in Mauritius we still have benefits such as an aged pension, free education, and free healthcare. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth gave a very reconciliatory interview regarding the government. <sep><sep> It is not just this, but this systemic crisis that is beginning to emerge, affecting all social classes. <sep><sep> It was surprising to us that PT-PMSD seemed ready to face the regional elections alone. <sep><sep> According to official figures in 1998, there were more than 8 million Palestinians living outside of Palestine. <sep><sep> PSM and a faction of MMM alongside Jugnauth joined forces, accentuating the former "Historical Bloc," under a temporary MSM leadership (a decade), with its own specificity (possibly more Bonapartist). Maneuvering through an alliance with MMM and their electoral victory in 1995 allowed them to regain control and consolidate their former "historical bloc" until 2005. <sep><sep> Today, Le Mauricien no longer has this extreme-right role, and it is an important newspaper in the Rivet-Delaitre lamp. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We can find contradictions in the information on our website and in this Review. <sep><sep> Today, one faith, when we talk to our friends, they have confusion in their minds. <sep><sep> The time when Marx wrote, it was the time when scientists were discovering unprecedented geological eras. <sep><sep> But, we are proposing a different way to face the crisis. <sep><sep> We are just new friends from the International Congress who gave them their name. <sep><sep> If the number of tourists is stable, because there are more hotels, there is more competition between hotels, so your occupation is finished and will continue to decrease. <sep><sep> Once again, instead of governments launching debates to see the future of production, the Government is looking at its marketing, looking at ways to defend the textile industry. <sep><sep> Specifically, when some States have somewhat divided in the world, they have abdicated their role to stand up for Israel and face the Chinese State, there are volunteers in regional political parties. <sep><sep> I said I agree to expose my life, not my health! <sep><sep> In addition to developing agriculture and industry to ensure food security. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Belle Rose, Xavier Duval is proposing to promote private pension funds, while at the same time acknowledging their difficulties. <sep> <sep> For every 2,000 artisans, there are: UASI, OUA, SIGWA, AGWU. <sep><sep> And to raise questions of outdated and unnecessary practices like "Mauritianism" and "nationalism".<sep><sep> Before this, there was no surplus, and everyone was looking for their main occupation just to be able to survive. <sep><sep> The questions regarding funds are being overshadowed by the constitutional shenanigans. <sep><sep> However, Blair has only changed the jurisdiction of Great Britain towards The Hague. <sep><sep> After 2 days you need to go and see a doctor, have them certify that you were sick, still are sick, and will continue to be sick. <sep><sep> You may find names that are interesting until today, almost 60 years, 70 years later. <sep><sep> This new publication is divided into five sections: <sep><sep> Q: Comrade Kreepalloo (in micro adventures): Can we get an enlightenment on a concept? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Marx and Engels were developing their philosophy, they were confronting 3 dominant types of thought at the time: <sep><sep> It was all about power; the working class felt oppressed; the way they treated people made them disgusted ... But the truth, only Balram knew. <sep><sep> The way historians write the history of Mauritius, often this struggle stands aside from our memories. <sep><sep> Like a young snake, it was hissing and swallowing its secrets outside and without hesitation, it was sucking food in the belly of the poor and miserable. <sep><sep>Meanwhile, in the Government's "Outline of Energy Policy 2007-2025", which has been presented to the European Union in the context of reform, it recommends optimal use of bagasse in electricity production. <sep><sep> We have also sent a delegation to meet President Bush within the framework of AGOA. <sep><sep> As a result of this behavior, it is now that Ashok Subron has resigned, part of the difficulty in gaining access to all the elements of the website. <sep><sep> So, in response, John Bellamy Foster has decided to respond to them. <sep><sep> Anne-Marie: With the closure of the port in Port Louis, leisure activities began to emerge on Monday, then on Tuesday, then on Wednesday. <sep><sep> but it represents and defends very specific and very distinct class interests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, it is not easy for an "associative league" to survive in a capitalist sea. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the recent introduction of Creole and Bhojpuri languages in schools, as well as the legalization of employment under certain conditions, represent opportunities for work for LALIT and other progressive organizations in the past 30 years. <sep><sep> In their efforts to favor the tourism industry, their policies threaten the last remaining truly indigenous forest in Ferney; they have confiscated public beaches and spent over 100 million rupees to widen the road along the coast. <sep><sep> Now, if they had any doubts, they no longer doubt after Subron's 7 banana slang, a slang that closely resembles Bérenger's. <sep><sep> Implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. <sep><sep> If he had given Tamby and Samy a lot of time and taken care of them well, because of his new responsibility, he would not have been able to care for Ramou, Ramba, and Kamla. <sep><sep> Yet, even if the program is well thought out, without militant means, strict active participation of farmers, it is difficult to promote such a program in which so much effort has been invested. <sep><sep> Therefore, I believe that no one is to blame, no one has done any research on this, but these measures have resulted in significant losses in expenses that employers have incurred on imports. <sep><sep> All this struggle has been organized by poor and oppressed people, Mauritians and Chagossians. <sep><sep> At that time, Martin King had just given a seminar. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even Minister of Labor, PT Shakeel Mohamed, is not flat Navin Ramgoolam himself. <sep> <sep> Karann, Karonn, and Princess Prathna are shocked, tell you. <sep> <sep> There are scientific studies that have been done on how the government helps children when it suppresses mother tongue, natural language, in schools. <sep> <sep> For example, it may be doing the arithmetic, it may be doing the essay in that field. <sep> <sep> But is Palestin today under the Israeli military occupation is negotiating as an equal people with Israel when Israel's armed forces are occupying Palestine? <sep> <sep> Bettina Cadinouche also said that, she is another advisor to the Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> Even if economists don't count like production, labor, and what production really is. <sep> <sep> The article refers to an “organizing committee”, but there are indeed very long situations that A.Subron has mentioned in that assembly. <sep> <sep> There was a speech from former President of the Republic Cassam Uteem. <sep> <sep> It is not identical to what we asked, we do not know what the Government will do with its 1500-2000 acres, but the important point is that Lalit has started discussing environmental issues since March 2006. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Then there was a financial crisis and a global recession that brought a downturn in activity in all sectors that depend on exports. <sep><sep> The Mauritian was waiting for Rex Stephen to send a "courier", which was carefully placed in its container. <sep><sep> Some people understand the forces operating on the earth, and on a vast space, for us to understand what is happening, for example, in places like Gooljaury, Kuzin-Kuzinn, or Medpoint. <sep><sep> "We will give the necessary time to our British colleagues to react. <sep><sep> Fim KLib had a vision "All About My Mother", a sublime film by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. <sep><sep> Today there is a more repressive legislative environment: There has been the arrest of Ananda Rajoo for the publication of a supposed false news, Paradise on the Day was banned on a technicality, there was the arrest of Eddy Sadien for cutting syrup with Jayen Chellum, there will be municipal elections, and conflicts with the government and the press, added to this, there are police with surveillance cameras, with the idea of a new identity card where information on individuals is on one card (which is considered intrusive), and where there has been an increase in the number of police officers, the construction of a new prison, and constant references to the Singaporean Prime Minister and his perseverance to stay ahead. <sep><sep> Naturally, everyone is favorable to the Best Loser System existing in Mauritius. <sep><sep> What will happen to the refugees in the refugee camp in the West Bank, in Gaza? <sep><sep> We believe that their unity will be able to put more pressure on the government towards the reunification of the Republic of Mauritius, where the right to return is an essential element. <sep><sep> The crisis in the security industry is giving the bourgeoisie of the state what it seeks. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the 3 years that Madan Dulloo and his MMSM were in the government, when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was involved in many scandals and other measures in favor of the bourgeoisie and against the interests of workers. <sep><sep> And importantly, only LALIT is constantly talking about this systemic crisis, which is creating all this disorder, a systemic crisis triggered by the protective shield for the production of sugar and textiles.<sep><sep> When I talk about international spending, in our second seminar that we will hold in two weeks, we will focus more on this. <sep><sep> Lalit's website finds itself in this circle of alternative voices that are rising in the world to confront the barriers of the capitalist press and analyze the world with a class consciousness. <sep><sep> This movement, of which Lalit is a part, is challenging the logic of this global capitalist globalization model that is engineered by the WTO and the great imperialist powers, defending the interests of multinational corporations and financial capital.<sep><sep> To get a literal idea of the film, it mainly uses photos and film footage taken in 2006 when the Chagossians made their “pilgrimage”. <sep><sep> It is not our intention to blame the NGOs that have already accepted this money in the past. <sep><sep> But the workers, they were saying, “But our work is our vote”. <sep><sep> Without the help of others, it prevented him from making a fuss. <sep><sep> And it is precisely the public interest that this ‘Playgroup’ reader represents: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> According to World Bank figures, more than 1 billion people worldwide suffer from severe food insecurity. <sep> This is in stark contrast to what unfolded in the MMM Congress. <sep> When everyone gathered in the living room, Jamouna, who for the first time had put on a sari, went offering everyone a plate of dates so that they could choose what destiny they wanted. <sep> Several BDS campaigns around the world have been successful, and Steve Faulkner, a British municipal workers' union activist in Southern Africa, declared, "BDS has now become an unstoppable movement!". <sep> Now it is clear that the Mauritian government is acting irrationally and is particularly showing the actions it is taking regarding the Chagos issue. <sep> Everyone is talking about this, and there are various analyses as to why Ammar Hassan did not win! <sep> We need to realize that in the LALIT, among LALIT members, for 3 years now we have been discussing this, we are going to face the challenge of this concept of "Mauritianism" as it is used in politics. <sep> Even more worrying, some women were so afraid that they did not want to have children at all. <sep> Following the revelation by the researchers, he wrote his speech which was published on the LALIT website in English. <sep> Red Pepper, UK 2008, article on Diego Garcia by Lindsey. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 5 years later, a new leader has emerged in the country. <sep> Ram Seegobin: It is possible to choose to be outside the region as well. <sep> Lalit asks all citizens who love freedom to stand up against Berenger's dictatorial regime. <sep> Today, there is only a small majority with support from PMSD, MR, and 2 former MSM members who Navin Ramgoolam managed to recruit. <sep> At that time, under Aneerood Jugnauth, 100,000 people were employed in the textile industry, and today, that number has dwindled. <sep> No other business will be able to survive in a capitalist production ocean. <sep> Hopes for this "Historical Bloc" (along with its 2 other concepts that follow it, namely "systemic crisis" and "transition into domination") will guide us in this work. <sep> Our proposal aims to make ALL schools and colleges equal. <sep> In addition, provisions have been made for 700 additional police officers, 84 extra Prison Guards, new police stations, and prison extensions. <sep> Sometimes we have a vague term, "bourgeois ideology" in our minds. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since 5 years, Jack Bizlall has retired from the union. <sep><sep> They subsidize the company in the media because they buy the time/space they use for their advertising that the media broadcasts on their behalf, somewhat like a subcontractor does. <sep><sep> He reasons steadily, always cautious, and even late into the night. <sep><sep> Moral: it should not be the habit of a group leader to engage in "strike" activities; it is condemned. <sep><sep> There is indeed a situation where they are not at peace in their minds. <sep><sep> For Ramba, Kamla's sexual orientation seemed to be confusing, a perverse monument. <sep><sep> Are we really willing to change society, what do you think? <sep><sep> I responded positively as I could because I was there yesterday. <sep><sep> He explained that in Latin, each worker and employer get a week's holiday per year, where he may decide which course he wants to follow. <sep><sep> So, he said, excluding the merchandise that we do not consume, the expenses on nutrient imports amount to Rs18 billion for 2011. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Paul Berenger lost the election, leaving many people living in villages disillusioned with democratic rights.<sep>
<sep>Regarding the 1 May Movement, it is still alive despite Bizlall's declaration that he is heading towards self-effacement.<sep>
<sep>Because the capitalism that started in England, the most advanced at the time, it imitated the organization system for sugar cane and land in the slavery era.<sep>
<sep>He was living with Celimène, a woman of Syrian origin.<sep>
<sep>This is true in the dominant class as well as in the oppressed and oppressed class.<sep>
<sep>and criticising the initiative "Wanted 15,000 Youngsters" was a response that revealed a real corruption, a real failure, and a crisis in traditional parties.<sep>
<sep>Either my creators want to say what they want to say or Collendavello wants to lie to people.<sep>
<sep>We ask the government to conduct a new survey, with responsibility for the departments responsible for marine resources, in consultation with organizations representing the disabled.<sep>
<sep>To mobilize workers in other sectors, to encourage them to work, applaud them.<sep>
<sep>In 1998, during a conference in Capetown initiated by LALIT and WOSA, Richard Greeman, a humanist Marxist initiated the idea of creating an international network that brings together anti-capitalist movements, revolutionary movements, and other related movements around the world.<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This knowledge we share and codify in our political program. <sep><sep> In the sense of understanding inherited sanctions in a dialectical relationship of sanctions through time, through history. <sep><sep> The struggle of the working class and the struggle for socialism is not against scandal, but against the capitalist system itself. <sep><sep> For a long time, we were wondering whether we were getting a new government. <sep><sep> Within the framework of the International Women's Day which is coming on March 8, and in a difficult moment in the history of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Kamini, ever so agile, was suddenly in her corner, it and her aunt's shop full of siphons. <sep><sep> We, we want to finish with this system. <sep><sep> An alternative economy: planting food crops, making it on a large enough scale to create employment. <sep><sep> It means instead of getting a unified platform, to develop a unified program, we are getting fragmentation among the confederations, and so the federations seem to be exploding. <sep><sep> The workers have a deputy in No.19, Reza Issack, who is doing well with Rama Valayden. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even the sand needs to decrease for it. When there is this kind of economic slowdown here, many economic sectors start to experience a sudden rise. <sep><sep> Well, that's another story! Perhaps we'll talk about it another day. <sep><sep> The opposition parties received this kind of treatment. <sep><sep> The government seems to be inspired by the Singapore model, a model based on a dictatorial policy. <sep><sep> The PT risks losing several cities if the MSM and MMM join forces, perhaps even all five. <sep><sep> Pregnant women should see a doctor to check for contraindications for the abortion medication, such as ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus), and skin diseases. <sep><sep> In October, there was the first Ernest Wiehe Jazz Festival in Mauritius, a great initiative that everyone who loves sweet music dearly wishes to continue. <sep><sep> (Re-Make, then Koz-Koze, then Re-Make again, political scandals from Gooljaury to Frer Timol, CT Power, etc.) this sequence is creating a series of political crises in Mauritius in February 2013. <sep><sep> When Bill Clinton was running his 1992 campaign, when asked what his platform was, he replied, "It's the economy, stupid!" <sep><sep> After that meeting, after all the bananas, the Lapointe Human Rights Court, Ka Bancoult, was finally rendered ineligible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There, to answer the two real questions which the concept of "Historical Block" has helped us. <sep><sep> Hamoked is actively involved in addressing issues related to checkpoints - contacting the DCO (District Coordinating Officer) and IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to locate detainees. <sep> <sep> "Today, we are launching a campaign in 2005 to create a new great agro-industry sector and develop the peace sector on an industrial basis. <sep><sep> However, the repression of the Mauritian Creole language that has been carried out and is still being carried out is worrying many children. <sep><sep> - The question that is being asked suggests, "Why are prices continuing to rise, even though the rupee is appreciating?" Even the newspaper L'Express is now asking this question. <sep><sep> In the last election, there was a registered opposition party called "Block 104", even though they did not reach the polling day, rallying behind Bizlall-Subron. <sep><sep> This has also brought about a significant progress. <sep><sep> Same way of thinking, same outlook on their opponents, same cautiousness towards others. <sep><sep> Before the 2010 elections, as we were preparing our 5-year review, even though we did not present a candidate, we proposed not just a program, but a 5-year political activity report. <sep><sep> He pleads that if he were to be arrested on a police brutality case, it would interfere with the work of the DPP. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - The bourgeois ideology became dominant naturally - because the capitalist system in power, in a total way, without any political contestation for at least the last 30 years.  
We are becoming part of our political program that we share, that we discuss and that all members collectively can share outside the party and develop it even more.  
But since the beginning when the Lalit campaign started and the support that Lalit received, MMM / MSM reacted very negatively on this issue of reparation.  
After 2 weeks, if all is calculated, you have worked more than 90 hours in sectors where there are 45-hour weeks, then you are overtired.  
But the law says and the philosophy says that, in fact, the worker receives a fair wage; a job only, a job where he cannot complain about being exploited as before.  
So for Blueprint and for VRS, no funds have been released.  
But, it has influence as it is close to FPU and some other federations.  
But Daniel Honore regrets that many regions do not defend their language strongly enough.  
Therefore, for some time now, we have been running a campaign to develop an alternative where people can find work.  
And we use this anti-ware mobilization party in Australia, in England, in France, to keep pressure on the bases, this is internationalist. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Mauritius, we have one of the greatest professors in the world in this field, Prof. George Chan. <sep><sep> In general, in Mauritius, successive governments tend to say that we have a diversity of industries, textiles, tourism, BPO, etc. <sep><sep> (Similar to joining LALIT later.) It was a political publication (a sort of free lib debate we used to call it) launched by a group of 12 individuals in 1976. <sep><sep> Because, on one hand, it is over a longer period of time, on the other hand, it is a better quality too. <sep><sep> Where every door has at least two guards with huge builds. <sep><sep> We analyze his statement to understand how a systemic crisis could take shape. <sep><sep> There is also a potential for aquaculture: fish farms like the one that started in Mahebourg, and even the possibility of seaweed production. <sep><sep> He also mentioned that union leaders, like himself, will elect a leader, after which they may not be in charge anymore. <sep><sep> This way, they can address issues like transportation, shift work, and transfers. <sep><sep> You are analyzing the power dynamics here in this class struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a paper that needs to be seen to consolidate the achievements of the development program that we have carried out over the last 3-4 years. <sep><sep> Hamas' majority in Parliament has become a minority because the Israeli army has kidnapped 30 of its deputies. <sep><sep> The Palmar station is relaunched to produce young animals, relaunch animal feed production, and relaunch seed production for planting. <sep><sep> The Crazy Government was precarious and was subordinate to Samazeste Toupoumwa and a coalition with Lord Toutouk Touni. <sep><sep> because it is necessary to change the favorable report on the water problem the water supply situation is getting worse after a cyclone that hit Rodrigues qualifies as the worst in the last 50 years. <sep><sep> Minister Bunwaree should also ensure that all MIE staff are working properly. <sep><sep> Like the MMMSP, it is a difficult situation, they came up with a national program, they also encourage diversification in an economic crisis context. <sep><sep> Lindsay Collen said today that we have a capitalist system that is not developed enough for what the people demand. <sep><sep> Since 2011, we have studied several newsletters which Lutte Ouvriere in France has issued to understand what it means. <sep><sep> There were many internal conflicts, especially between Marx and Bakunin, who represented different anarchist groups. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He goes to University 3 days a week and volunteers 2 days. <sep> <sep> We will enjoy every opportunity to understand everyone in the demonstration as essential; this will bring the possibility of sanctions. <sep> <sep> Facing the Subron enterprise's CSG levy, a means has been found to separate state union federations (FPU) to form a "Collective sector union Liberation", introduce an "Observatory for Democracy". <sep> <sep> How it is, there are communal and communo-religious pressures that subsist; there are some dances. <sep> <sep> We need to keep in mind that Facebook is a private company. <sep> <sep> He is not doing this work for the sake of it, but for himself. <sep> <sep> Likewise, the Prime Minister we are referring to used to make speeches where he would cite the astronomical profits that the IPP is making on the backs of workers and poor people. <sep> <sep> There was a dispute between the union and the employer, this went to the Minister for consultation. <sep> <sep> Large sugar cane planters (who are PT's drainage ditch, and his name). <sep> <sep> Society itself is a system where if one goal is affected, it can have an effect on other goals. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Matinal, a newspaper with Indian capital, is released every morning, its website is www.lematinal.com. <sep><sep> In the final phase, syndicates such as the Nursing Association and GTU, Nursing Association which regroups nurses and midwives and where GTU, primary school teachers, have shown support for this bill. <sep><sep> There are political parties and even more programs, and in the same way about a political program, the same way to act, it is visiting the same things that we target. <sep><sep> This is because it is a society, we are in society, we want to believe that the law protects it. <sep><sep> People are already aware of everything that Princess Prathna had done, but they had no hope. <sep><sep> But, she no longer has the power she once had, obviously. <sep><sep> The workers worked for 6 months here, then went to another place. <sep><sep> They say that these 8 people were infected by communist and racist viruses. <sep><sep> This includes Diego Garcia as well, Solomon, Peros Banos, Six Islands, and some others too. <sep><sep> But this paper is to scrutinize the critical assessment of the Labour government as well as MMM, MSM which are criticized. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MAAS involves a strategy where each cane field continues to close, centralization and automation processes continue. <sep><sep> while others bring sanctions in the relationship between employer and union, and the way they interact. <sep><sep> Girl, boy?' - 'I don't know.' - 'You have a reason. <sep><sep> And it's also a very complicated matter, involving an extraordinary intellectual and militant integrity effort. <sep><sep> This can have serious consequences on people's lives if no measures are taken. <sep><sep> And he used to contribute together with other people to bring about this society. <sep><sep> They broke their physical strength, making their minds believe it. <sep><sep> That is, when you find a major meeting with Fidel Castro, it's a big popular party, which claims his allegiance to the nation, but deep down in a truly revolutionary sense of popular revolution. <sep><sep>For many people with a reactionary idea (or with an integrative idea from different corners), there is also a 3rd element in their minds, a downright punitive element: no one has done anything "bad", so it should be "punished". <sep><sep> He had a beautiful face and his twistedness that was always there gave him a special look, the impression that his leash found farthest, deepest than a normal leash. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kuran Deerpalsing-Sayed Hossen has become the rescuer of all plants, especially large plants that are seeking more attention and direct control on these new "klesters" plant products emerging from weed: <sep> <sep> Fukuyama may have been mistaken when he declared that capitalist society was so fantastic that he managed to stabilize it for eternity, not less. <sep> <sep> This analysis has allowed us to better understand the coalitions, alliances, and conflicts that have arisen in politics after independence. <sep> <sep> We only knew when to start, to take action. <sep> <sep> This campaign gives people the opportunity to act in the field of legal justice. <sep> <sep> After taking action, one after another, until Septam 80, a new wave of public awareness, a new movement, to make the government finally respect all points in the legislative process, to regain beaches for everyone. <sep> <sep> * Also, as previously mentioned, against repression and police brutality; we will continue to campaign on these two fronts. <sep> <sep> There were questions about the ongoing urban movement in Lasinn and what it meant. <sep> <sep> The organization in Mauritius has signed an agreement with several organizations to ensure proper treatment of addicts. <sep> <sep> Because they are so separated now that they can no longer work together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is just as important to get up with the dawn of the La Saine which is becoming a new global economic power. <sep> <sep> At Checkpoint, there is a turnstile where a soldier checks all vehicles coming from Nablus and from settlements. <sep> <sep> The evening ended with a very convivial cocktail party while Lindsey Collen was reading under a demand to dedicate her book. <sep> <sep> In the US, there is a military base in Seychelles, with its “hunter killer" drones already in place. <sep> <sep> It certainly does not belong to political parties like MMM, PT, MSM, which are completely dictated by their respective business interests, in other words, the bourgeoisie that is taking advantage of this devastating development. <sep> <sep> So, Bérenger's double-talk was a triple-language, a triple-speak, where he said he is not attacking BLS, that the system is correct. <sep> <sep> Large planters and small planters together form sugar and the PT and its Bloc Istorik reign in favor of the establishment and its dysfunction and its cane. <sep> <sep> There are still many actions/methods of struggle that we can imagine, but we need to have actions and methods of struggle that correspond to what the current situation demands, and we have the resources to do so. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, Ally Hosenbokus represented Lalit in the debate forum that Amnesty International's Mauritian section organized in collaboration with St Andrews. <sep> <sep> he maintains that MMM is ready to take a stand on the Diego Garcia issue, where there is a military base and only asks the UK to give back the other Chagos islands. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, these actions and pleasures on other people are critical to continue. <sep><sep> In the public service domain, the Civil Service Federation has gone on different goals. <sep><sep> It has privileges to testify with its own wisdom. <sep><sep> Then, after Ally Hosenbokus, Ram Seegobin took the floor. <sep><sep> They are against targeting for the same reason as Lalit, that is, it is a similar system because it forces people to prove that it is miserable, and also it is a step towards stopping social services as a right. <sep><sep> Alafen, it's just starting, it becomes us, it sits, talks for a while, then it goes home. <sep><sep> It refers, in great detail, to the connection Marx finds between his dialectical materialism and nature. <sep><sep> MBC TV, during the general strike, naturally had a role. <sep><sep> He said that people in Palestine made him and all other volunteers a call to tell everyone in their country, the true reality of the occupation. <sep><sep> In all these different cases, we have a legal program, a program that focuses on things like health, education, and justice becoming rights. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the midst of the Mulen Kann Rural Development Campaign, which had just begun at that point. <sep> <sep> All the proposals that Ganga had made were dismissed outright. <sep> <sep> Other countries are suffering a more severe crisis, and it's not their responsibility to deal with the crisis. <sep> <sep> This political stance implies environmental impacts that are completely incompatible with a truly sustainable Mauritius: <sep> <sep> Before this, when a political leader in the village attacked a woman who refused him, injuring her and dragging her outside. <sep> <sep> Compensation for poorly paid workers was based on CSO statistics, at a rate of 8.1%. <sep> <sep> 3. Has the Government allowed concrete establishments and agricultural land concessions (IRS), followed by permits for ERS to other property owners; permits to build a Mall etc? <sep> <sep> LALIT will continue to mobilize in Mauritius and Rodrigues for a true alternative to energy production, and for a society with less energy waste. <sep> <sep> Therefore, prison, it needs to be a space that can fulfill its role in reforming prisoners, especially young prisoners. <sep> <sep> In the MMM's Statement of Achievements, their greatest pride is that they managed to expose the government, particularly through the Medpoint scandal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When, in the face of the WTO, the sugar industry is in crisis, all governments - MMM, Labour, MSM - they all collaborate to support the sugar industry. <sep><sep> This systemic crisis is prompting an attempt to achieve a new historic compromise to allow the bourgeoisie to regain a certain serenity so that its exploitation can continue. <sep><sep> The launch of this diary is extraordinary within the framework of an exhibition of photos taken by one of the greatest photographers in the world, Garo Nalbandian. <sep><sep> Karinn, can you explain to me...? - I don’t really understand. <sep><sep> Even his public statement was effective in bringing billions of rupees and creating job opportunities for people in other countries. <sep><sep> He has put a lot of pressure on the Chagossians to accept a minimal compensation. <sep><sep> They are coming on Friday to harvest and will be returning on Sunday. <sep><sep> Following the mobilization that Lalit has triggered on the Diego Garcia issue, they have successfully obtained the first major documentary in Great Britain on the Chagos issue, namely STEALING A NATION, by John Pilger. <sep><sep> Today, in a press conference, Lalit has explained their proposal to defuse the crisis in education. <sep><sep> Does anyone realize, for example, in one of the two religions in the Constitution, there is less 'Mauritian'? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, when linn fini not in the world Diego which is strict by a snake tennis player, Paloma sennkutla was then in a world lower than a temporary one in Lerop. 
<sep> For Yosi, this journey had become routine, but remember that Princess Prathna only did it once in difficult conditions when she had to fight to snap in karay. 
<sep> When they entered the angering stage, they finally had with rain OUA, and with rain workers in all sectors like the sugar sector and security, (but without direction from their union). 
<sep> All university departments (except natural sciences, perhaps) became more upright. 
<sep> This is a bureaucratic, governmental matter, completely pointless to change society. 
<sep> So, the Labour Party was thus given 2 slaps, who, it seems, against big capitalists in the sugar/security sector: 
<sep> Let me give 3 examples, this act of assimilation, which becomes an actor in the spoken language. 
<sep> So, he, he went to negotiate with Satcam Boolell, who was previously Minister of Agriculture. 
<sep> In the local elections to be held in December 2004, this strength will have the possibility for political expression (the first time there will be municipal elections in Palestine). 
<sep> What has allowed LALIT to survive and continue to contribute at the national and international political level all this time? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In general, the balance of power in society is less favorable than it was at that time. <sep><sep> When there is a confrontation with MSPA, it creates a conflict between the Government and MSPA. <sep><sep> It is a more profound work, requiring careful analysis and where Lindsey Collen has made a proposal, the Government is considering in the same line. <sep><sep> The plan for agricultural diversification by Mr. Monty has been criticized for several attempts since 1973 to introduce agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> They have to sell their land for a lower price to buy land for the current crop. <sep><sep> There was MMM, himself, more KMLI3 and then a front quite a flash called FNSI4. <sep><sep> The three Sadous sometimes got a shock with him. <sep><sep> Second thing, on the question of sanctions to come: U know there are 3 things that will come together to make this sanction happen. <sep><sep> At the same time, religious leaders have made speeches with strong communal tones. <sep><sep> For example, the Federation of United Workers (FTU) has agreed to provide assistance in solidarity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Four years later, only 257 arpents were allocated to cooperatives for agricultural production and 82 arpents for waste disposal. <sep><sep> On one hand, to make way for division and communal dance, on the other hand? <sep><sep> Even in a time when Mauritius was heavily immersed in a capitalist system, all serious debates have excluded material equality from campaigns. <sep><sep> When Jugnauth said that the MSM-MMM-PMSD had created 46,400 jobs during their term, he did not mention how many positions the work had destroyed. <sep><sep> We are going to gradually take control of the site, decide what to plant, take responsibility for what to produce, control the way the work is organized. <sep><sep> But documentation has started drying up in this new liberated space to make a huge leap in document spacing. <sep><sep> We would have believed that “Lanpir Maurel earned protection for Workers” against corruption, while it is a political strategy. <sep><sep> Otherwise, why would such a large flock of people accept such blatant injustice? <sep><sep> * IWPS is following reports that the Israeli army is using nerve gas in Palestine. <sep><sep> A week later, when the rainbows asked their ministers if they had solved the issue of dirty pots, they found out that dirty pots were sprouting everywhere like mushrooms after the rain. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the 1982 General Elections, the former leader of MMMSP supported the Labour Party, but after 1983, they supported Jugnauth against MMM. <sep><sep> They won't be able to control and tax transactions, they said. <sep><sep> A "Platform Against the New Labour Laws" was formed by a series of organizations under its control, where Subron has no presence. <sep><sep> In 1983, when there was a tie, Boodhoo and Jugnauth went to a common ground, with the latter prevailing. <sep><sep> He promised a ministerial post if elected. <sep><sep> If on Thursday, if that's how it worked, this Labor Day event organized by the existing Trade Union Platform invited political parties like Lalit. <sep><sep> There are 9 foreign doctors involved, including 5 pathologists, 3 general practitioners, and 1 neurologist. <sep><sep> It was in this turmoil that MMM raised issues in the census, it was in this wave of mobilization. <sep><sep> a British fabrication to buy Chagos illegally from Mauritius when it was given independence in 1968. <sep><sep> This has allowed a new generation of writers and emerging poets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to Paul Berenger, while the Prime Minister has the right to decide for the National Assembly. <sep><sep> However, still in their homes, individuals, ordinary people, especially women, the elderly, and children, subconsciously feel that private property of individuals', livestock, goods, warehouses, are no longer protected by force. <sep><sep> You can enter a store that sells alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, but only if you work in the store, you cannot buy alcohol, cigarettes, and go home. <sep><sep> Energy like the sun, the sea, wind, differential temperature in the sea and atmosphere. <sep><sep> LALIT is launching a campaign against this New Identity Card that the Government has started implementing. <sep><sep> A search on the Internet has revealed 1.2 million leaders, the vast majority exposing cases of fraud and other problems. <sep><sep> There is no difference in wages between workers in Mauritius, Here, and workers in America, Great Britain, India, Australia. <sep><sep> A 3 third quality of opposition based on a vision in favor of the working class. <sep><sep> MSM-MMM with the complicity of employers and the IMF are threatening to dismantle the existing social security system that protects workers' rights. <sep><sep> The team did not win their trust despite starting to gain all kinds of invitations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After an evening of drinks and snacks, spectators had the opportunity to hear Joelle Hosenee (vocalist) and Rajni Lallah (piano) in a series of bites on the theme of Lemorn. <sep> We will share, as we share with friends today, as we share with everyone in our hearts, today. <sep> In general, the trade union movement can't say, "No, we don't have time for you." <sep> This Saturday evening the Timi-Balram family net has entered the water to go for a swim. <sep> Along with his friend Mimose Therese, he has set up the first union for domestic workers. <sep> And with the reduction in production, one textile factory is closing after another, workers are losing jobs in the thousands, overtime for workers is disappearing. <sep> We have a very real threat that if punishment is too extreme, it leads to situations where there are more assassinations following acts of violence, so the witness will be intimidated. <sep> Can be used to eat maggots, bait to feed animals, and its skin used as bait. <sep> When these two laws have finally come before Parliament one after the other in 2008, LALIT is the only political party that has publicly supported union demonstrations against the Labour Government. <sep> This protectionism on which the sugar industry has developed and survived since colonial times is now being dismantled: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, you will find that the Workers' Government gives individual permission to weaken trade union transport workers, but when this happens, companies have problems. <sep><sep> Among these eleven resignations, only two central committee members, Ashok Subron and Veena Dholah, and we also note that all have disappeared since the Central Committee immediately after the Member's Assembly who made it on the 4th visit. <sep><sep> Today, worker classes regroup in a more fragmented trade union movement, more than 7 Confederations, more than 25 Federations, more than 400 unions. <sep><sep> And he said it is a structure that has helped us a lot, in the collective planning of our election campaign. <sep><sep> 3. Power seems to interest many Mauritians. <sep><sep> And the second thing that worries, the population, all the people who follow politics too much and even those who don't follow too much, believed that the Best Loser system is over. <sep><sep> And what is going to happen to influence resolving the Palestine issue? <sep><sep> Under the pretext of an assassination attempt on a bureaucrat leader, Stalin eventually imposed arrest and execution by thousands, by dozens of thousands, party activists. <sep><sep> He was right down the road, doing what he wasn't listening. <sep><sep> And he, the woman, he has created a space, created a void in this universe for him, he started dancing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is no need to make a big fuss to know that the Euro crisis will have a major impact on the capitalist economy of Mauritius. <sep><sep> And it's true that we need to develop a more professional form of agriculture. <sep><sep> Let's not forget that Dr. Ram was far away, Mr. Robert was a good person who was providing a lot of services, he was defending Brother Dass for free when the police were accusing him of illegally cutting trees in the Crown Forest. <sep><sep> In a seminar organized by the Federation of Para-Statal Bodies and Other Unions, the State Employees Federation and the Local Government Unions in 2008. <sep><sep> I have contracted a disease that is killing me mercilessly. <sep><sep> This "Historical Bloc" has laid the foundations based on "anti-tablism ideologies" - where the Workers' Party mobilizes people against tablism, and where it will promote a new "emerging bourgeoisie" that we call "state bourgeoisie" (because its growth depends on the State). <sep><sep> Monday 18th October 2004, Lindsey Collen and Ram Seegobin had to appear before Court Number 3 in Port Louis. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah said that the decision to ally with the candidate depends on the launch and political significance of the elections. <sep><sep> The Director used a slightly formal tone, almost as formal as a formal invitation, where there is melodrama around a series of pressing issues in society. <sep><sep> At the same time, we have links with political organizations in other countries that are part of this internationalist current, which is developing the potential of the working class and all oppressed people to challenge the international capitalist system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As part of the World Literacy Day, the Education for Workers organization is organizing several activities. This year, the EWP is also celebrating its 30th anniversary as an association that has proposed and developed an alternative pedagogy for literacy. <sep>
<sep> However, it is worth noting that, when asked, he would say in the Workers' Party, they do not agree. <sep>
<sep> The army, through this Control Tower, is not only monitoring all vehicular and human movements in villages, but also inside their homes at night. <sep>
<sep> They announced that if there are 400 workers, they will close the shops. <sep>
<sep> At that time, the PMSD was embodying the historical bourgeois interests. <sep>
<sep> While the “indeterminate” contract has no limit. <sep>
<sep> They are also, like we were doing, doing their best to prevent a serious problem from becoming more serious. <sep>
<sep> So, what is the effect of all this exhibition on politics? <sep>
<sep> If it was so easy to send inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, I can't say nothing is possible, we have to ask why until now Israel has nuclear weapons, why are the Arab League states, Arab countries that are very close, are still posing with Israel's nuclear arsenal, why until now they could not ask inspectors? <sep>
<sep> We always have to be on the lookout for a long struggle campaign, we have concluded. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The magicians were predicting the weather in a loud manner, while the rabbit was moving slowly so the magicians' assistants were struggling and throwing the weather ball. <sep><sep> He was a shy and timid person, he started to talk. <sep><sep> If you are involved in a political party, socialist and revolutionary, its main principle is to question the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Today's International Context What characterizes today's international context is a combination of economic crisis that continues to be almost global and an ecological crisis. <sep><sep> and on "When there is this contrast between worker and capitalist, who wins exactly?" His argument, for example, was based on a single text by Marx. <sep><sep> Even though the Report has many limitations in the analysis of culture and its unique development within a capitalist system. <sep><sep> - Training of all members in the framework – that is, members in branches, and recruiting new members in branches, and who can defend the LALIT program at local, district, and public levels. For this, we need good documentation, democratically accessible to all members. <sep><sep> Third representative, France Charlot said that he was born in Mauritius from the first generation of Chagossians who came from Salomon. <sep><sep> This is historically true, and up to this day. <sep><sep> Tim prepared all the food that his family liked to eat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the march and the guaranteed price through a good Marketing Board that stabilizes the price to produce milk, honey, eggs, fish, vegetables, and through a good Meat Authority; <sep><sep> It has been very aggressive, and has followed the trail predicted by Marx, Lenin, Luxemburg, Trotsky, and Gramsci. <sep><sep> Henri Favory gave exceptional testimony (which was exceptional as he is a griot storyteller) about how, among other things. <sep><sep> Such a settlement 10, such a settlement 20, part by part, there are licenses. <sep><sep> Even in the USA, where the police have a good reputation, there is no right to flee so easily there like that. <sep><sep> Clearly, neither the Government nor the municipality has the capacity to resolve this problem. <sep><sep> When there is a Seetulsing problem, he says that this candidate classification system, it's not possible anymore. <sep><sep> Worse, they were all saying they were calling him Prathna. <sep><sep> During the 7-8 months where we are bringing demands, we are holding meetings, and also partu in Moris. <sep><sep> Often this social vision can, if it is politicized enough in a program like LALIT has, provide perspective, provide hope for the future. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 1 kilogram of potatoes costs 4 shekels, that is equivalent to about Rs 30.00 in Mauritius. A bag of potatoes weighs 100 grams. <sep><sep> Whether it is in Diego Garcia, Iraq, Palestine, we want the occupied territories to release them. <sep><sep> Conclusion In the future, everyone should write down the history of each stage. <sep><sep> Instead of an ambitious agricultural production program for export as well as local consumption, which could replace these 2 dying sectors, the Government announces that it will support these two dying sectors even more. <sep><sep> We certainly need to "occupy" the universities until late, as well as the stock exchange, as they embody pro-capitalist ideology. <sep><sep> We have conflicts between people who are suffering from pollution and people who have jobs in this area, each in turn demonstrating. <sep><sep> The right to sell or own property, the right to buy or own property, which we may find normal today, but in feudal times it was not a common right for the majority of people. <sep><sep> So, the PT clearly wants its

a national impact. <sep><sep> - We have written several articles to expose the dangers posed by a 5th "community" on the Nomination Paper, that is an object of concern. <sep><sep> Because they are a political party that has become strong. <sep><sep> MMM, through its Mauritianism, which we have analyzed and criticized in our seminar before, favored collaboration with a bourgeois section in Mauritius, which they themselves called "progressive employers". <sep><sep> Artists who will celebrate freedom against Repression: Battery - David Serret; Percussion - Brian Boucherville; Bass - Clyde Goulou; Digital Piano - Rajni Lallah; drums - Jhonny Joseph; Double Bass - Steve Desveaux <sep><sep> You work either during the construction of a building, or a 3-month contract, or a 6-month

government has published a program for an alternative economy where there are concrete proposals for a development based on agro-industry. <sep> <sep> Unfortunately, for the launch, the Minister of Labor was invited to the launch, when at the same time, the Minister celebrated enemies of workers in Tras, and today it was the Minister responsible for the introduction of new labor laws and anti-worker industrial laws. <sep> <sep> So it will be without obligation, an interesting debate. <sep> <sep> We all step outside onto the balcony to see where the sounds are coming from. <sep> <sep> We need to examine the flaws in MID, which prevent us from seeing where there are simultaneous policies that are incompatible with the notion of 'sustainable development'. <sep> <sep> Because the first thing a society wants is stability, meaning its ability to reproduce itself. <sep> <sep> But, Bizlall, he had abandoned political affairs, giving all his energy in a collective dream, thinking

not just a theoretical or political process, but it was also a real process. <sep><sep> 4 Realities that the anti-imperialist struggle is facing, in this new economic situation. <sep><sep> So when we are heading towards Independence and after Independence, especially after 1953, after 1959 with the universal franchise, we get, by then, a Labour Party in power, having political power. <sep><sep> In the 90s, A.Jugnauth's reign began to be marked by conflicts with the Catholic Church in confessional schools and law GN114. <sep><sep> The Education for Workers announced at the ceremony held on Saturday, 3 September at the LPT Mother Earth Hall in Grand River North West. <sep><sep> In Santa Clara, the bus is a popular means of transport. <sep><sep> These two victories directly follow our UVER Let at Minis Obeegadoo where we have accused the Genocide Government, according to the UN. <sep><sep> So, a useless column because it is not in the village/neighborhood, a useful column because it is in the village/neighborhood. <sep><sep> Everyone may have heard about GMOs, a lot of publicity has been made about it saying it will end hunger in the world, but will it really? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When you run through Medine during the sugar strike, tell me and Ram, "Go take care of Britania, your strike won't be in vain." <sep> <sep> For some time now, I've been reading in the newspaper, especially on social integration, there are 1,078 street children. <sep> <sep> Even if it denies this role, this denial has its place in history. <sep> <sep> The fact that there is now an official spelling for the Creole language will encourage the development of Creole writing and also Creole literature; <sep> <sep> But here, because our union culture is different, here in Mauritius, because many workers see the union as either a political job that a political movement is doing, or as something that will help them personally when they have problems, in general, the union culture in Mauritius is such that workers do not identify with their union. <sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie would prevent a shift in elections on the economy, and the press today would prevent the economy from becoming central. <sep> <sep> In general, the situation hasn't changed much in 30 years. <sep> <sep> Workers have received an increase of 15% + 2% + 2%. What if, for example, controllers and mechanics both demand a raise in 2 years? <sep> <sep> You have a private radio broadcaster, and then ordinary citizens start talking about anti-government issues which address real problems, rather than sounding like baseless racist criticisms such as "Don't put your dirty laundry in public", or "When will the country go back to being English?" <sep> <sep> Here, there is a limited number of days off, because workers are being abused. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A bus from Nablus with students from the university is returning home to Hares and the surrounding villages. <sep> Instead of using diesel, petrol, gas, all that, a decision needs to be made to start using vegetable fuel, bio-fuel, as well as using corn to make alcohol. <sep> However, for our part, it is the workers who need to claim ownership. <sep> But, those who espouse 'Mauritianism' very quickly in their discourse have some kind of superiority complex, from Mauritian to 'Mauritianism'. <sep> The MMMSP gained a lot of coverage in the bourgeois press, literally pumping out everything, where the light of dawn breaks, perverting it, turning it into a nationalist narrative where workers and local employers come together as one big family. <sep> He did not know what he was getting, but he was feeling that the time had come for him to go. <sep> After the 1917 Revolution in Russia, where the working class organized and overthrew the Tsar's dictatorship and, in the same vein, the bourgeois dictatorship. <sep> The government gives women contraception, but the government promotes abortion. <sep> Interaction with Alain Ah-Vee 3-4 times a day. <sep> The publication of this book coincides with a time when we are finding more development of a favorable opinion towards more freedom rather than repression to address issues such as the increase in AIDS cases and violence in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> WTO continues to exert pressure on Europe to stop all subsidies as soon as possible on the DISIK, following the Dispute Settlement Unit, and this will have direct consequences for the storage of subsidised products. <sep><sep> Whoever was watching this secret movie, put on a smile, take care of his passion for comedy. <sep><sep> To understand this better, let's look at the level of trade unionism we have here? <sep><sep> Municipal elections are being held in a very particular context, 10 weeks after a General Election that brought a new government led by the Labour Party to power, and MMM-MSM-PMSD were placed in opposition. <sep><sep> Now, you are waiting for its ability to work and pay it for that. <sep><sep> And the MSM is "looking more towards the West" - meaning Singapore, Malaysia, China, India. <sep><sep> Yesterday, all workers know the limitations of elections when they say "Pull one end, the other end will follow!" For LALIT, we have enough strength to often put our national issues on the agenda during 2-3 months of electoral campaigns, that's all. <sep><sep> its base is more at the higher level of traders, truckers, job contracts, title entrepreneurs. <sep><sep> But a transitional program will not stop the movement. <sep><sep> When it's time to go home, tell them to go home. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We, in LPT, believe that the creole language is beautiful because the members of LALIT have developed a different way of speaking. <sep><sep> And like others, it is necessary to protect it, it. <sep><sep> When Roland Fozoo and Devianand Narrain passed through the Mahebourg Court, Mr. Macque (Biding) said in court that Inspector Ghoora forced him to forcefully sign documents against them. <sep><sep> Today we find that violence is taking place in a jungle of languages that children do not speak, do not understand, are naturally soiling. <sep><sep> They, they only have their strength to work for their living. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy: Sympathizer of LALIT, who was in other Seminars, and the public can contact us to request an invitation. <sep><sep> When we leave the house phone, follow us on our mobile. <sep><sep> We will establish our opponent, a bourgeois ideologist, Jean Claude de L'Estrac. <sep><sep> For example, the Government may be looking at a project, then - we find it in the country's books - even they know it will cause damage later. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam is threatening to sue the press, for defamation and private life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Navin Ramgoolam is preparing to launch an extreme right-wing campaign in favor of nuclear energy, we must say. <sep><sep> You have to choose which struggle - among many with national implications for the working class - will be the most useful. <sep><sep> Karzai, a former Afghan state leader, was also heavily discredited. <sep><sep> When the economy is in crisis, we know that talk about coalition politics will take center stage. <sep><sep> But people are not hearing much about the real economic and social crises that are coming in the next 2 to 3 years. <sep><sep> This exceptional event will take place in the Port Louis Municipal Council on Wednesday, January 16, 2008, and the launch will be in the Lasal Council. <sep><sep> The World Social Forum called for the creation of a new formal institution to monitor this. <sep><sep> Sweatshop workers are producing capital that will last forever. <sep><sep> According to soldiers, they must be given a lesson so they don't mistakenly settle in Israel. <sep><sep> It brings a dynamic, this punishment, towards the liberation of the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Exactly what he is proposing on the best loser system, the public does not know. <sep> <sep> When debating about the best loser system, we immediately face a resistance that is based on religion. <sep> <sep> Therefore it is important for us to realize the importance of our role, to expand it in terms of the number of cards, to strengthen its development, to reinforce it. <sep> <sep> So it is more an ideological representation than an economic representation because according to us, there are many small businesses that will eventually end up in the bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> While this could be a historical occasion to convert from cane to agricultural land for food production. <sep> <sep> We need to reverse this process and replace the "CEB Bureaucracy" with a "CEB under democratic control". <sep> <sep> Gilbert Ahnee has already proposed the creation of agricultural villages where people can have housing and land to cultivate. <sep> <sep> and serious diversions in the budget for a true reparation for the damage slavery has caused to Mauritian society. <sep> <sep> The new imperialism is not just military, but also economic. <sep> <sep> Everything has been destroyed: debris, fish have died, everything has been shattered. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The demonstration took place in the context of a hunger strike that 8 families were conducting in Garden Company, opposite where the British Commissioner's office was located in Lassaux. <sep> Everyone agrees that more planning is needed. <sep> Certainly this is not the ideal solution for bringing about progress, but it is just a manifestation of anger with a system where all blame is placed on children, where all blame goes to the parents. <sep> It involves expending energy; it is an action according to the capacities to do something we have. <sep> This kind of work, domestic work, is expanding a lot. <sep> The permanent members of the Security Council (USA, UK, France, USSR) are meeting in the Ad-Hoc Committee. <sep> The title of the article is also seeking to create a belief that there is a strong opposition to the introduction of Creole language in schools. <sep> So it is necessary that today develop enough strength to bring about the legalization of mother tongue, Creole and Bhojpuri language later. <sep> They require the State to have a more legalistic definition, to look at it like how the Constitution of Mauritius defines "The State of Mauritius". <sep> But there are other advertisements that newspapers put out that are morally questionable, convincing arguments that are not "normal", such as "using this soap because such an actress uses it". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After everyone present has realized the significance and importance of this meeting, a unanimous resolution has been made to organize a presentation where each guest is invited to invite family members who may be interested in attending. <sep><sep> Send an email to herbert@focusweb.org to indicate your interest in participating and to indicate how many delegates your organization/delegation plans to send before March 15, 2006. <sep><sep> They want my hands full in their world, they want me to dance to their tune. <sep><sep> The concept of meritocracy, when we use it to challenge communalism, is also weak. <sep><sep> It's not just the government that agrees with the Creole language, but it has taken the time to give it an academy. <sep><sep> A line of communication had been opened between Limem, the DDT, and Dharam Raj. <sep><sep> In conclusion, what we can say is that what dominated this debate was an emotional and irrational reaction. <sep><sep> So, as we continue to build an organization within LALIT, and in doing so, combine the work of LALIT with the work of other organizations, we keep in mind the inherent strengths of those fighting for their rights, against the Government, and those opposing them as well. <sep><sep> There has also been a condemnation by other thinkers of "social Darwinism", and some people have had difficulty accepting natural sciences like Darwin and things like "metabolic rift". <sep><sep> Lam Po Tang has closed down an old production unit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The IMF boss kicked him out, the Socialist Party kicked him out, his family kicked him out. <sep>

He came in September 2003 with a law to abolish the Village Council. <sep>

Lalit is making a call to all workers and poor people to mobilize with a program to build a real alternative to the MSM-MMM government. <sep>

When we distribute "massive" leaflets, as we call them, meaning between 10,000 and 12,000, in one morning. <sep>

Not so much for lalit on its own merits. <sep>

In LALIT, we think of yellow ideological and strategic ideas that need to be used to focus on lalit de class, on the development of class consciousness. <sep>

This campaign has already received support from other social, union and youth organizations. <sep>

- Written word is an important medium for storing our individual and collective memory; <sep>

a prize that UNESCO awards to organisations that are contributing in a significant way in the struggle to promote literacy for all. <sep>

When all these are put together, we realize that it is important for us to understand exactly what the UN Human Rights Committee is saying in its work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Maybe even like a President with more power, when Ramgoolam puts him in that position. <sep><sep> Proportional Representation on the issue of Proportional Representation (PR) position MMM and PTr? <sep><sep> And because there is so much political zigzag, the only constant is Berenger. <sep><sep> So the Social Alliance cannot even nominate a candidate to defend its economic policy. <sep><sep> In the Road Map, new legislation is proposed (see them in paragraph 5.8.5) to force sugar cane planters to continue planting cane. <sep><sep> But it would take a long time to implement such a program. <sep><sep> He said that UNESCO has awarded this award based on that work. <sep><sep> He was saying that we do not have confidence in a candidate representing the Workers, and with 2 PRO establishments, we are withdrawing our support. <sep><sep> He said that they are ignorant who do not know the sacred texts, who repeat words learned by heart, who are always with rituals, etc. <sep><sep> This will then truly reflect a better democratic system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It's just a natural reaction, because someone has mistreated him at work. <sep><sep> The press and Radio Moris seem to have adopted this American guy this week. <sep><sep> Lalit, in its letter, also, because of division in the country on the issue of "education", is asking the government to bring back the Gokhool Plan and BEC to the Form VI College. <sep><sep> Every day, a big mess of wire is spreading across the musical notes in all corners of Planet-de-Senz. <sep><sep> And we also have our trucks, which we occasionally distribute throughout Mauritius. <sep><sep> It seems that tears have found a trick to circumvent the law on the 3-year detention rule. <sep><sep> The right to strike, by decision of the lifted army, allows workers to develop their strength on the site. <sep><sep> I don't know what their priorities were at that time, but certainly in the union movement, there was no desire to work in this direction, towards developing a program. <sep><sep> The boss measures how much each of the 6 workers has contributed to his basket, the basket's weight on the balance where the mill is, and pays the worker in proportion. <sep><sep> I conclude with something we did in April 2009, if I'm not mistaken, where we had the Lamarche du Peuple, the Lamars and La Chaumiere, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How to protect citizens from anti-democratic laws like the PSA and POTA, introducing new economic, social, and "environmental" rights in the Constitution? <sep><sep> It is difficult to define the exact problem, its content. <sep><sep> A spokesperson should normally be a committee member elected. <sep><sep> But there was no demand, no organization to support these demands. <sep><sep> Some deserve a certain position, some deserve a salary of Rs60,000, others Rs10,000, others Rs4,000. <sep><sep> The ACALAN committee conducting this work is called Stories across Africa (STAAF). <sep><sep> If Rajni Lallah - who is not here today, she is requesting an apology, they are recording a CD, she and her group - if we, two women, have suffered as such, we need to realize what this means, it's not just for us. <sep><sep> and Latin America and international organizations against the wars that have devastated the international community over the years. <sep><sep> There is a long queue for all services, taxis, other vehicles heading towards Salfit. <sep><sep> These compartments clearly show how our lives in work, family, politics, society all desire to expose this cruel exploitation hidden below, since forever. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is only because the government has already told him to make electoral reforms that the Committee can take advantage to make such a mansion. <sep><sep> He visited Sainte Croix on the 11th of March, especially for family reasons. <sep><sep> He prefers small hotels, and enjoys sailing on pleasure boats. <sep><sep> In 1980, a group in the Lalit de Klas put pressure to get the Labor Party to join the 4th International, while after Ut 79, they thought they were strong enough to try to take control of the MMM, while the Labor Party wanted to consolidate the gains of the 1979 strike. <sep><sep> He enters into big contracts with capitalist firms like Building and Engineering, COLAS, etc. using public money. <sep><sep> "Secondly, I will start working on this Road Map which the current government, through the Minister of Agro-Industry Arvind Boolell, has presented. <sep><sep> This message from Jooneed Jeeroburkhan to keep an eye on it was so urgent that we had to put it on our website. <sep><sep> Legalman Timi could have continued on the coast until the election if his moral conviction had not made him think of his name. <sep><sep> We have pleasure to have many active members in the union in this industry. <sep><sep> 3. There are oil and mineral resources in Africa. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How voters will be able to choose between the different types of teams. <sep> <sep> And Alain Fanchon has read his poem "Ti bato papye" which was used as the key to the case. <sep> <sep> It was the last paper presented before LALIT devised its action plan for 2013. <sep> <sep> So, LALIT launched a campaign to diversify Mauritius in order to create jobs. <sep> <sep> The "animals" section also includes pigs, deer, snakes, birds, etc. that people do not eat. <sep> <sep> Regarding the DSP, it is forming into a Socialist Alliance. <sep> <sep> But, very quickly, this same expedition turned into a fiction film. <sep> <sep> The second influence that exists in the newspapers is a) inappropriate content that is found in spaces where there are paid advertisements, <sep> <sep> After the 2005 elections, Balancy allegedly allowed 11 candidates to enter the election without declaring their ethnicity. <sep> <sep> (For a long time now, artists have been a little scared when they put pen to paper: if they do not put umbrellas they may be brought before the Vatican!) An umbrella is a protection that you carry in your belly or your mother's belly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But in that period following Independence, one of the biggest means to develop this detestable bourgeoisie was through a political strategy called "import substitution". <sep> <sep> So the education system risks making more fools than wise. <sep> <sep> Making rum, ethanol, bagasse briquettes to sell electricity to the CEB, supplying sugar cane to the soil. <sep> <sep> This is not how we should make working class people stop supporting bourgeois parties like MMM, MSM, and PTR, and make trade union movements participate in a mobilization against the capitalist system and its anti-worker laws. <sep> <sep> Rivalry between bureaucracies dominates this immense satisfaction and the will of delegates. <sep> <sep> It is not a force where you put the forces of each individual together. <sep> <sep> For example, for artisans, we have 3 unions, representing artisans at a national level, and there is a union of wage earners representing only FUEL workers, and it is recognized only in FUEL establishments. <sep> <sep> It is a phenomenon that comes after Stalin's strategy for "socialism in one country" which failed miserably. <sep> <sep> In the campaign that we will lead on this Parcel, we will start a debate on the need for an economic and political alternative that can create opportunities for all the unemployed today, as well as for the generations to come. <sep> <sep> So the colonial government had set up a Land Resettlement Scheme to allow small planters to have access to land and diversify agriculture. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Princess Prathna and Yosi were spending a lot of time together. <sep><sep> He was a smart and resourceful boy who had excelled in his studies despite his poverty <sep><sep> With the ancient route, the school would have fallen in Israel. <sep><sep> This is because its politics and economy are fragile, and during the electoral campaign, we will only be facing an economic crisis ahead, for everyone. <sep><sep> The Government of Mauritius has never granted their voting rights, they have never considered them, he said. <sep><sep> but only the Confederation of Private Sector Workers and General Trade Union Federation responded to our call. <sep><sep> We are also particularly critical of the Minister's presence in these socio-religious matters. <sep><sep> A: The union has a duty to defend the interests of its members. <sep><sep> I will briefly provide some elements that we should consider in this direction. <sep><sep> The systemic crisis that the economy and society of Mauritius are currently going through. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are basing their campaign on Subutex, they are basing their campaign on the way Navin Ramgoolam treated Sithanen, saying they have a problem. <sep><sep> The MSM-MMM government persists in claiming that its Local Government Bill will bring more decentralization. <sep><sep> We must remind the government that it signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1976, ensuring the right to a fair trial in respect of economic, social, and cultural rights (Articles 6, 7, 11) <sep><sep> It is a tradition that we have had for a long time, and we will continue to do the same. <sep><sep> When Kaya's body arrived on Edward VII Street, Rose-Hill, on February 21st, 1999, by midday, many people discovered his body with numerous injuries, up to 32 injuries on his body. <sep><sep> Initially, after Alain Ah-Vee's intervention, the members mentioned the fact that Lalit members were on private radio a lot, creating a political presence that did not exist when there was only the MBC, a government mouthpiece. <sep><sep> All governments that have come and gone have encouraged the development of economic sectors that are heavy consumers, on one side, and fragile, on the other side. <sep><sep> For this reason, I decided to use my "cuyon" from the beginning. <sep><sep> The Dakar Protocol is moving forward, the Cotonou Agreement is disappearing as well. <sep><sep> Ramlogun, who closed Alcatraz, for the first time, the police investigation led to the suspension, arrest, and questioning of 7 policemen involved in his arrest and interrogation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Next year we will need to rebuild the bridges, when they become more dangerous. <sep><sep> In the elections on the 3rd August, the support of the LALIT party may contribute to developing the necessary strength for the working class and the union no longer to be over this hypocritical state represented by IRA. <sep><sep> We needed to report to the Prime Minister and ask him what needed to be done. <sep><sep> That is to say, people in civil service, they are working under a depression. <sep><sep> This represents a political movement that gives an indication of the workers' attitude towards Aneerood Jugnauth and later towards MSM. <sep><sep> We notice in all statements, whether on the radio or the press, that it is uniquely Ashok Subron who has acted as a spokesperson for all resignations, as if it seems he has had no coordination or meeting with resignees. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we started a committee, with lawyers and other organizations, and we have been working for several weeks. <sep><sep> In what is happening today, it is interesting to look and analyze how politicians in these left-wing parties have this tendency, especially when there is a conflict within the Alliance in power. <sep><sep> He asks Navin Ramgoolam a PNQ who answers by saying that the government will start official negotiations in 2000: conditions that might bring into question Mauritius' sovereignty over Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Then, when the WTO regulation comes, employers and the government claim they did not know all this time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Berenger himself proposed that there should be a Best Loser for women, just to show how well he knows that these parties can recover inflamed. <sep><sep> And today, when he acknowledges a Chagossian group as an exiled government, as illegal citizens of BIOT, and when he is organizing visits between BIOT and UK citizens. <sep><sep> Our first big challenge is with him, in his morning speech our Former President Cassam Uteem has described accurately, in a very soft way, in a very wise way and he has described a lot better than I can describe. Our first big challenge is how to keep those three fundamental parts in Chagos life well, in a well articulated way, how to keep them together, how to articulate one with another. <sep><sep> This is why we need to prepare ourselves very well. <sep><sep> Free to reset the past, free to try new experiences, free to make mistakes if need be in order to learn. <sep><sep> Professor Arnaud Carpooran, the head of the course, explained that this course (standalone) has attracted more than the minimum number of prospective students to start, otherwise the University would not have progressed. <sep><sep> 12. Government must raise its voice in international institutions against WTO blockades that seek to prevent the protection of agriculture in Third World countries; especially when Europe and America subsidize their agriculture; <sep><sep> To facilitate understanding of the stories of Diego Garcia, we are publishing a chronology prepared by Veena Dholah and a group of comrades. <sep><sep> Some countries, like Cuba, have linked their struggle for independence with their nationalism. <sep><sep> They were drawing water in the South Pole without rights to water; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will facilitate the arrangement between Berenger and MSM for a rematch. <sep><sep> Because this capitalistic sea, it recovers tel actions. <sep><sep> It is a painting that reflects, we find a little Northward, a little Port Louis, but everyone looks at the painting, gets its feeling for this invasion. <sep><sep> It happened when Uncle Ganga and I separated. <sep><sep> We in LALIT have chosen, have chosen to keep the nature part progressive, during this downturn. <sep><sep> What emerges from these 2 papers already is a very serious economic crisis, a systemic crisis, and it doubles with an international systemic crisis. <sep><sep> We had a meeting in Plaine Verte last Friday, where there were PT deputies, MSM, MMM, PT Minister, FSM deputies. <sep><sep> That's why, for a long time, we have been criticizing the Government because it only looks at the Mauritius Sugar Authority, when it should have an Optimal Land Utilization Authority, working in the interest of all social classes. <sep><sep> The Historic Block has Frozen Workers have managed to reign supreme, in one way or another, many times since Independence. <sep><sep> Kamla, who left school to work in the factory, had clearly shown her orientation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Passengers and soldiers must disembark and check their ID cards. <sep> <sep> When Paul Berenger was Minister of Finance, the first time he served as Minister of Finance, he stopped the tripartite presidency. <sep> <sep> If you ask a worker, he will tell you "Everyone has the right to property. <sep> <sep> Whoever owns the land, controls what can be planted on that land, and does not want any new sectors to be imposed. <sep> <sep> It was also fascinating to listen to comrade Ahmed Khan at the same time when an imperialist coalition was bombing Lalibi and comparing it to the bombing in Afghanistan. <sep> <sep> What the Workers' Party is going to do, that's another matter. <sep> <sep> A great uproar has been mobilized behind Mussolini, a former trade unionist. <sep> <sep> The LPT is dedicating this prize to all students, professors, members, sympathizers, associations, and individuals in the Republic of Mauritius who have associated themselves with this struggle for the recognition of the mother tongue. <sep> <sep> In addition to lexicon, literacy materials can also be used for other aspects of written language, such as punctuation, grammar, etc. <sep> <sep> There are criticisms against the new government, but not on the reintroduction of "good behavior" in prison. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At 3:15pm, 4 security guards in uniform intercepted 2 members of LALIT, one of them a student from MIE. <sep> In the same Government, there was a Prime Minister and a competitor for that position. <sep> Paloma said that she will not marry him, how will they have true love then. <sep> In any case, even if there's a very democratic union, controlled by the workers, then too, the union, by its nature, has fundamental limitations. <sep> We are intensifying our campaign and preparing to demonstrate in front of supermarkets and companies that continue to sell Israeli products as they have found their way into many other countries. <sep> As we are approaching this day, we are only celebrating "work" itself, meaning "work" in opposition to "capital" (capital, which means no more than "work done in the past", "work" that has taken the form of division - land ownership, machinery, leasing, banking, hotels). <sep> There's no limit to ambition in business, all economists are saying. <sep> It was making a common mistake, it was using that common propaganda and an apparent reproach, it was using the yellow. <sep> With our proposal, what will happen is that the parent will have to fill out his form and choose his partner according to his preferences. <sep> At the same time they are working on an "accelerated restructuring plan" which ultimately means that there will only be more VRS and more moments. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, I find that not everyone is following suit, however. <sep> In particular, working families who are most oppressed by these two laws: <sep> Then they protect their restaurant, their company that goes around the world, their catamaran business, their construction firm for threats, etc. <sep> This results in an increase in the number of people speaking Creole normally at the age of 25.3% every year since 2000. <sep> Even though they finally form part of the same bourgeoisie - especially in the face of workers' class demands. <sep> Jabaljas: Excuse me if I am wrong, Bulbak, but I have the impression you are being sarcastic with me. <sep> Also, during a meeting with the Minister of External Affairs M.Dulloo and the Secretary of State for British and Commonwealth Affairs, D.Milliband, just before the United Nations General Assembly in Geneva. <sep> With new deaths, Bagatelle, Cascavelle, La Croisette, they are all facing difficulties. <sep> Official institutions such as ICAC, ESC, also found a decrease in their credibility. <sep> When a woman is violated, everyone knows, when she goes to the police station, she is threatened with a second violation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economics is the science that explains things like price levels. <sep><sep> Timmy realized that his work was important not only because it was supporting his family's livelihood, but also because it was guiding his life in a positive direction. <sep><sep> Today, on one side there is Subron and his GWF, JNP, and on the other side there is Bizlall and his FPU with a Collective Interior Sector Collectif. <sep><sep> Not to be left behind, groups like 'WANTED' reorganize as block 104 while concepts like 'Mauritianism' are disseminated. <sep><sep> After the government replaced the tripartite with the National Pay Council, there have been protests from union movements. <sep><sep> Sometimes extreme rights, often "nationalist" in a negative sense, are based on the misfortunes of the "middle-classes", pseudo-bourgeois and others. <sep><sep> They went to Valencia to visit a recently nationalized factory called Pedeval where food production takes place. <sep><sep> With all these crimes and violence, theft, and the list that people are accustomed to giving. <sep><sep> - Hey buddy, you couldn't tell me this from the beginning. <sep><sep> This crisis has brought to light the flaws in the system we are living in. It's not just the result of a capitalist system that has been damaged or out of control, or that it has flaws. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> *Re-introduce regulations for employers; if they do not respect the regulations, be prepared to work without a work permit. <sep><sep> MMM and PMSD need to ask themselves another question: Aren't they also aware that they, do they know that Mister x, Mister y, Mister z ( who is a magistrate or has been convicted) is an individual who will never change? <sep><sep> The playgroup has produced a whole set of publications for children in Creole and Bhojpuri, as well as educational material in Creole. <sep><sep> We have found 2 young boys who have brought us into the olive groves of As-Sawiya. <sep><sep> LALIT's internationalism in practice. So, for us in LALIT, internationalism does not mean simply taking solidarity action towards oppressed classes in another country, but today we have made it a priority in our political work here. <sep><sep> More taxes are being paid out, so the establishment does not contribute more to the economy. <sep><sep> There were also some provocateurs who Lord Toutouk Touni's security council had placed in various places to create chaos and see if they could incite violence and then blame it on Princess Prathna's supporters. <sep><sep> Today I will take Lalit's position on women's emancipation. <sep><sep> Education should be completely free, including exam fees and books, everything. <sep><sep> But, there are many people who believe that historically, as books have a divine origin in religion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He has put a damper on everyone else's spirits.<sep><sep> What could have reduced sugarcane planting by 42% when it returned: MMM-MSM-PMSD government seems to be proposing measures that only benefit establishments.<sep><sep> An energetic policy that is both useful and good for the environment that is not dependent on speculation or suffer the consequences of international conflicts.<sep><sep> Another way to look at the strength of a bourgeois section is to look at its capital.<sep><sep> Its importance lies in making this yellow stuff accessible to everyone.<sep><sep> By examining, for example, Government's stance today and even Parliamentary Opposition.<sep><sep> Ram Seegobin explained on Tuesday how the Berenger-Jugnauth government specifically asked the Sachs Commission, which was supposed to take care of the electoral reform to prevent a flawed common ballot system. <sep><sep> We share our ideas with other organizations, and through that, we spread them. <sep><sep> Sometimes our protests even take place somewhere else in a cry out, in a great big-luxury milieu, in a great big-luxury Porlwi. <sep><sep> ERCP it was a version 3.0 since Sithanen's Stimulus Package, the first Finance Minister of the PT government from 2005-2010. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, government officials used to check if the owner had a goat in the yard before giving old-age pensions. <sep><sep> *We need to prevent the government from making workers pay for the crisis caused by the employers. <sep><sep> Take into account 99% of people who work, not that 1% of employers. <sep><sep> It is the working class that has both the interest and the strength to counter it. <sep><sep> We have had ministers, deputies, and Maulanna who have responded. <sep><sep> So far, it is not so much a matter of taming people, but of taming people who follow politics, organized people. <sep><sep> Former President Cassam Uteem stated that the last speech made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Zini Nation was a powerful, good, and strong speech. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is important for workers to know exactly what the demands are. <sep><sep> However, the GWF was a federation with a very rich history. <sep><sep> And Berenger, he was silent and his role was to defend the representatives of the minorities. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The new law ERA 2008 has stated that, "No, the week begins when the boss wants it to begin." <sep><sep> For example, accounts, essays, short stories, fables, poems, health, surveys, lyrical compositions, etc., they all have certain functions that we can subgroup under these five headings: <sep><sep> But now the boss contributes 1% to a fund (from the salary of the individual) called a "recycling fee." <sep><sep>This opening letter is a way to announce the results of this survey. <sep><sep>Our campaign has been well received, and we have delved deep and changed its nature to adapt to the food crisis, as it arrived during a global crisis that was already hitting Mauritius. <sep><sep>We are delighted to reproduce in text form Rajni Lallah's "Introduction to the State", which formed part of the first session of "Political Education" LALIT, in its new series. <sep><sep> However, it shows how when a day of revolution occurs that is successful, the way it may-contributed to overflow. <sep><sep> Today it is reduced to representing either the historic bourgeois class or the communal minority. <sep><sep> - You know my daughter, you and Yosi should probably return where you came from. <sep><sep> So in Disid Africa, there has been some evolution from the bourgeois dictatorship that existed here. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to IRC, SILU - who also had a chair in IRC, was clear that SILU would get another "no" again. 
<sep> There is a series of invitations that have been accepted to take the floor.

<sep> Managing Gonndouana or Managing Bolema Holding manages the economy and government of Gonndouana. 
<sep> It risks taking the headline for "truth", and thus influences all 10 levels without even realizing it. 
<sep> Once every 5 years, all voters go to vote in one of the 21 constituencies, 3 candidates from Moris, 2 from Rodrig. 
<sep> Consequently, there is a risk of a popular boycott in Europe and elsewhere against our products if they are not "GMO-FREE"; 
<sep> Just like in Moris, establishments are planting sugarcane to make rum from the juice and a plan to make ethanol with molasses, instead of using land to grow food and meanwhile creating jobs. 
<sep> KAISE BELONA When we want to be more protective outside, and companies are making it difficult; when schools do not provide education but throw children into dark corridors; when churches do not guide us by how to turn the coconut, how to turn the coconut? <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, what is the Government proposing for people who are not inclined towards information technology? <sep><sep> In LALIT we stand tall facing the challenges in the union. <sep><sep> And we know how it has infiltrated and how it has been used for a cause. <sep><sep> But, the rules are set by private organizations, not by the State. <sep><sep> For example, a government is attacking another country considering it fundamental, and supposed to be promoting democratic freedom there. <sep><sep> The Government is negotiating for compensation after the end of the Dispute Protocol. <sep><sep> When there are no class differences, there shouldn't be this antagonism. <sep><sep> Debates are happening on the grounds of electoral reform with the beginning of a process that diminishes democracy instead of deepening it. <sep><sep> This debate has arisen following the catastrophe and all the sad events that occurred in Japan where the Fukushima nuclear plant was destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis. <sep><sep> When the new Finance Minister from PMSD, Xavier Duval, presented his first budget in 2011, couldn't he have mentioned an impending economic crisis when looking at his economic measures. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>  How many members of the family have, how many sisters have, how many police officers have. <sep> <sep> It is important to realize that a union, by its nature, seeks a negotiated solution. <sep> <sep> Then, in the concept of 'sustainable development' there are contradictory notions, so we need to question whether this is political and program in itself, i.e. the policy and the program itself. <sep> <sep> And also they should get reparations for their suffering in this year. <sep> <sep> Support the University lecturer and demand from the students who have taken the first course in Creole Studies in 2007-2008. <sep> <sep> This kind of people who sell books yap yap in the street. <sep> <sep> Today in America, people are starting to say no to Bush's military policy, and are asking all American soldiers to return from all bases. <sep> <sep> Today we have the pleasure to publish the discourse of Ragini Kistnasamy on the issue of women's liberation. <sep> <sep> They can decide to pump from one organization or another party, because they believe they are doing good work. <sep> <sep> And this crisis has an economic aspect, but it also has a very serious social aspect. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Rawat is establishing strategic links in Reunion for Nokia. <sep> There were also those who were more influential Marxist theoreticians, with a larger number of theorists who had analysed, for different reasons, that the use of dialectical materialism to interrogate reality had been inappropriate. <sep> This is giving work to many people in Havana, and they are expanding it in other cities. <sep> We must keep our principles alive, representing the working class interest, and not the interests of MCB executives, nor the interests of the Ministry of Labour, nor those of Nita Deerpalsing, nor of any Political Nominee. <sep> The Association for Civil Rights in Israel published a document entitled "What constitutes legal Actions and what constitutes illegal Actions, by the Security Forces?". <sep> This undermines the principle of primarily eating food produced locally, including in Mauritius, uses agricultural land for plantation for biofuels such as ethanol. <sep> The time is approaching for all workers: there was a massive retrenchment in the Security industry and the Free Zone; there is a rupi devaluation, a new repressive coalition after the election. <sep> Massimo Calabbresi, who was among the journalists who accompanied Bush on his mission, reported that they found nothing on Diego: nothing. <sep> A campaign to boycott Israel completely on economic, political, diplomatic, academic and cultural grounds. <sep> The first mask to fall is that which says "Mauritius is a Paradise". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But where exactly should we go, he didn't know because the sun was shining, the guiding stars weren't visible. <sep><sep> A large section of our country is succumbing to big capitalism, especially from abroad. <sep><sep> We are dedicated to building this extra-parliamentary opposition, based on a Program of heart and consciousness. <sep><sep> One of the elements of this press conference was Lindsay Riviere, who is currently editing and directing a press group, La Sentinel, but who previously edited two newspapers, Le Mauricien and L’Express. <sep><sep> Lalit has also participated in other platforms against communalism. <sep><sep> But, when this man is making a statement today, on radio, on television, on the internet, in the press, especially, he does not accept this as an ideology. <sep><sep> In the briefing, journalists know how much space remains in the newspaper. <sep><sep> When Balram was expressing his experiences, Timi, with a sly smile on his lips, was reading him from afar. <sep><sep> to youth groups, in favor of sexual minorities, to trade unions, to social movements, to human rights movements. <sep><sep> This will allow everyone to benefit from the significant increase in productivity that we have witnessed in the last 30 years, where technology allows one worker today to do the work of 50 workers yesterday. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin in his political "horizon tower" in the National Assembly LALIT Meeting on Sunday 2 September GRNW started to bring out what in our last year Theoretical Seminar. <sep><sep> An academic from Lalmayn who has been doing research on the nature of capitalism in Moris for years, and who started his research on the question of the French Zone, has come to Moris to do further research. <sep><sep> For some time now in Moris, there has been a bourgeois section that feels blocked. <sep><sep> and in indirect tourism, but we are also aware that it is a fragile sector. <sep><sep> When looking at the census system, it forces the deputy to act as an "elected representative" in his constituency. <sep><sep> There were members of the WSF Organizing Committee, such as Eric Toussaint, who is also in the 4th International, in an interview in Imprecor (Feb-March 2010). <sep><sep> There were people from the age of 12 to pensioners. <sep><sep> Seychelles, since then, has reclaimed its place, and naturally, it has regained them. <sep><sep> All political observers knew that the country was heading towards a spectacular punishment because Timi had come, despite him, a national hero who was attracting a large crowd that was listening to him as if he were a 'charismatic'. <sep><sep> There were reasons like this that were nourishing the country and these reasons needed their own cultural organizations and work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a crisis in the management of the CHC with the departure of Archimede Lecordier and Jacques Faustin, following a campaign led by the new union A. Subron, PLMEA. <sep><sep> There are natural events that can occur, such as cyclones, and there are also political issues that may make it impossible to postpone the National Assembly for an early election as he said he would. <sep><sep> But it's worth noting that when Marx introduced this concept of class struggle which brought progress, it's important to note that he was referring to social classes that were already in conflict. <sep><sep> But we must celebrate Labor Day in a positive and constructive way, especially given the threats present in a severe economic crisis. <sep><sep> This is a policy that has been put in place and strengthened. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we don't find it sufficient to just "take to the streets." <sep><sep> There is an attempt to use repression against those who criticize the authorities out there in government. <sep><sep> When we meet a comrade who was in the struggle with us, we feel something profound, an extraordinary intimate connection. <sep><sep> In the Bidze Speech of 2011 (for the year 2012), we found that XLD began to introduce measures to address the welfare state issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It's important to understand that every gift comes with a perpetual ideological conflict, otherwise there would be someone seeking dominance. <sep><sep> This means that the freedom that the boss has to send workers away without any justification and their indifference to what we call humane life. <sep><sep> It continues to dominate, even though it's only 1% of the people, because it has convinced enough people of the value of a highly limited form of democracy we call "bourgeois democracy." <sep><sep> With his support, Ganga had the necessary funding for his degree, a BSc in paleontology. <sep><sep> One evening, he was sitting quietly at his desk, lost in thought. <sep><sep> But the Minister of Labor, Shakeel Mohamed, has enough knowledge and experience to know that only a balance of wage increases between the union and the government will forget about the problem of beach security, forget about the problem of 5-star hotels and working conditions. <sep><sep> Only then does he realize that his column cannot go into the villages or the outskirts of the city during a general strike. <sep><sep> And one thing I've learned, which doesn't deserve any intellectual or philosophical respect, is the law. <sep><sep> We will clearly bring to light the violation of human rights, the way people have been uprooted, under what circumstances have brought Mauritius into a difficult situation, where the economic situation was very difficult. <sep><sep> Other forms of agitation were suffocated by this phenomenon called "WANT-ED: 15,000 Youngsters" that turned into "Azir Moris", led by Jameel Peerally. They became a political group in 2012. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People need to find connections, articulation between different aspects within the program. <sep><sep> BAI, Ah Teck, Bhunjun, these are examples of detailed bourgeois elements which have been developed by new Workers. <sep><sep> Already we are finding capital in the security industry heading into different African countries and investments from Africa entering processes of Shopping Malls, IRS and the Financial sector. <sep><sep> A launch of an "addictive" has the capacity for children to think better. <sep><sep> If people start accepting means-testing for pensions, then step by step, more people will not qualify for different pensions. <sep><sep> The dignity in which it is more useful in consolidating our political program and mobilization behind our Program. <sep><sep> LALIT we believe in reinforcing the political struggle, especially in the context of the economic crisis that is happening, in Mauritius we are already feeling the effects of this crisis. <sep><sep> The presence of the Group of Independents 5 people in the lodge had become the Group of Independent Regional people: they say it is the same anti-imperialist struggle they are leading. <sep><sep> It is a serious problem we are facing, and I suppose it is the realization, the realization of this gravity level, which all comrades present here have agreed to. <sep><sep> In these 550,000 people working, there are 300,000 (56%) who work for a "big employer" (2) and 250,000 (44%) work for a small business. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> An interesting development on the situation in Palestine and Israel but with two NGO representatives. <sep><sep> However, they are also facing difficulties in operating. <sep><sep> Daily violence and torture to extract a "confession" often forces a retrial. <sep><sep> The struggle condemns this repression and baseless accusations against our activists. <sep><sep> Sometimes unexpectedly, a peaceful event is followed by another, while chaos ensues in a whirl of mediocrity. <sep><sep> We proposed establishing a uniform property tax throughout the country, but a tax system that applies only to properties exceeding a certain value and not to small, impoverished homes in cities and rural areas. <sep><sep> Later, I was explaining how our Political Bureau was formed. <sep><sep> But, as a socialist activist, it is my duty to propose strategies and actions that lead towards the class struggle, rather than towards class collaboration. <sep><sep> Our fourth demand: we want price controls and a Cost of Living Allowance indexed for all minimum wage workers. <sep><sep> This central figure will operate with transparency and will be located in Pte aux Caves, Albion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is said that a bourgeois landowner fled to Larisi during the Czar era in 1917, he belongs to the same class as an entrepreneur in the BPO sector in Cybercity today. <sep><sep> So, we need to understand that we are in a stone grinder and we are continuing to go into that grinder. <sep><sep> - Do you want to say Big Ben? - No! Big Bang. <sep><sep> When PLHDWU went, the union found it tough, it cost with Rama Valayden, then with PMSD. <sep><sep> To use the mother tongue as a pillar, or as a support language, that is not illegal anymore. <sep><sep> They regrouped people on a list asking for a ride, but especially on a national limewet. <sep><sep> Here, we need to mention the UNESCO global prize for Education for Workers. <sep><sep> In 2010, there was a phase where they were pushing people out brit-brit for a yes or a no. <sep><sep> And for the Labour Act which was voted in 1975, it was always during the State of Dirzans. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Response from Ram Seegobin: It seems that Navin Ramgoolam and David Cameron have been talking. <sep><sep> But this time it is different because the period that I have described between 1982-2005, is a period of great economic change at the level of Mauritius and at a global level. <sep><sep> These voters understand this distinction well and then, for their own interest, whether at the level of elections, or for credibility, they develop this thinking that everyone has to attribute their problems to their community. <sep><sep> There is an article in the media today showing the seriousness of the economic crisis, whether it is here or at a global level. <sep><sep> and this has started with a situation where there was a balance. <sep><sep> Their reasoning is that once a team has won a majority at the constituency level, it is quite strange to change the results. <sep><sep> After we learned that there are complicated relationships between different groups of young people, it became clear that it is impossible to allow new members to integrate into a body where there are such complicated relationship complications. <sep><sep> The strongest moment in the history of class warfare: Lagrev Ut 79. <sep><sep> There were six girls and six boys who were preparing for a weekend of reflection on different aspects of life. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister is saying that if the establishment does not agree, he will abandon MAAS (which he calls his Plan A), he will adopt Plan B, and he also has Plan C and even D. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now America is making all kinds of threats and pressure to prevent a vote of 9 out of 15 in favor of the Palestinian motion in the Security Council. <sep>
<sep> What characterizes the Novam 2008 Teacher's Training is that there were more female participants. Students who have just completed the MIE course are Arning members. <sep>
<sep> But, the Bank did not receive any customers, so they failed. <sep>
<sep> We drew a life of 240 pages against the biased system in 2005, to present its history, arguments, etc. <sep>
<sep> We have launched a Program for an Alternative Economy, for a long time now, especially prior to the general elections. <sep>
<sep> Both alliances have started their campaigns with empty slogans. <sep>
<sep> When Freedom March reached Checkpoint Qalqiliya, the Israeli army was already there in full force - 10 armored tanks and more than 50 soldiers. <sep>
<sep> Either they are looking for the "sense of the economy" ("letov"), playing in the field of considerable experimental experience that the "oligarchs" have in business. <sep>
<sep> You say "Yes, he is an owner, I am also an owner, I have a motorcycle, I have a house too. <sep>
<sep> Otherwise, how do you explain violent gangs where an ad-hoc group of men, who have just had a picnic together, for example, all decide to attack a vulnerable individual they randomly saw on the street? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is intriguing when representatives of civil society have meetings from the Indian Ocean Business Centre to Brahma Kumari. <sep><sep> It is a movement that can mobilize genuine strength, leading towards real progress. <sep><sep> The Historical Block allows the constant emergence of a new detailed bourgeoisie and the reinforcement of various sections of the detailed bourgeoisie, with all communities involved (such as Rawat, Seeyave, Jean Suzanne, Jean Marie Richard and dozens of the most known companies), yet it questions the historical bourgeoisie, and certainly questions the royal bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> In other words, for the past three years, we need to use the money from the Euro, the accompanying money, to create employment on a large scale in agriculture and agro-industry. <sep><sep> BASES needed a speaker to address the Anti-Lager World Movement Assembly in Mumbai, a Lalit member, Lindsey Collen, who took the floor. <sep><sep> Since our birth, we have taken the Lalit de Classe political line. <sep><sep> MSIRI studied each type of Moris soil to determine the best variety until they could have the best variety of sugarcane, New France, Cyclone and Drought were organized as science. <sep><sep> For bourgeois economics, economics is a mechanism separated from politics, separated from society. <sep><sep> Thanks to it, ultra-conservative Endo-Kreol notables have been upset.' One might say. <sep><sep> There was a situation where an CIA agent was sitting in the MLC office. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The National Assembly has adopted a motion presented by MP Jean Claude Armance on the issue of "compensation" in relation to slavery. <sep><sep> He and his uncle start flying their plane on each of their own orbit. <sep><sep> Instead of the government having direct responsibility to provide public services, it needs to be accountable for the services it offers and must account for the policies adopted by the public sector. <sep><sep> No, Lovelock is among those who say that sustainable development has exceeded by 20 years. <sep><sep> it triggered the dangerous communalization that was brought to light to start the Anti-Communalism Movement. <sep><sep> The more they ate, the more they were satisfied; the more they gained, the more they wanted more. <sep><sep> To this day, we have not yet spoken of basic needs, which we have talked about for a long time. <sep><sep> (d) Various labor disputes in Mauritius against the use of fossil fuels (coal/charcoal) for ecological reasons and for a true renewable energy alternative to "vested interests" in fossil fuels. <sep><sep> This clearly shows that leaders (particularly in the world) do not have the political will to switch to renewable and sustainable energy like solar (solar thermal and photovoltaic energy), sea (wave energy, tidal, etc.), wind (wind energy) which is clean, safe, and free... <sep><sep> The light system, for it to reign, it must continue to divide. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And after the MMM/Ptr coalition government, we will have an even weaker opposition. <sep><sep> We were not surprised that we learned about "the State". <sep><sep> He wants to use land where food can be grown to produce molasses for making ethanol to put it in cars. <sep><sep> The delegation went to see President Mubarak to send a letter asking for an end to the prohibition of access to Gaza. <sep><sep> What lessons do we have for today in our mobilization for sanctions? <sep><sep> for example, the Diego issue, the mother tongue issue, the IRA issue, and the women's liberation issue. <sep><sep> A political party you find in the newspapers what it is saying; you find who is there. <sep><sep> Residents of the countryside, Lalit members from Black River, and other Regional were present. <sep><sep> The petition, signed by hundreds of organizations and individuals, including trade unions, women's organizations, village councils in different countryside. <sep><sep> Another publication in 2012 was our Book Rose, Current Political Situation, where LALIT was implicated? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For a long time, the establishment and the plantation owners have been demanding a reduction in the CESS tax. <sep><sep> The authorities have not yet interviewed other lawyers who are experts on the Bestloser case, such as Jean Claude Bibi. <sep><sep> The film "Stealing a Nation," which was part of the international efforts by Lalit against the Diego military base and the Zidane workers' solidarity work within the UK court system, has in turn, inspired many supporters to strengthen the base. <sep><sep> However, since a certain number of artisans resumed work starting from 16 September, particularly in the security industry, the strike began to weaken. <sep><sep> Increasing taxes on the poor and workers, such as VAT, is unfavourable. <sep><sep> The Social Alliance government has no plans to address this issue and has no concrete proposals in the new Education Minister Bunwaree's plan. <sep><sep> Nevertheless, what is quite striking and interesting, and also in our preaching, we had foreseen: <sep><sep> In fact, in 1989, the government did not pass a Trust Act (which Lutchmeenaraidoo had mastered), and Sun Trust was registered in February 1990. <sep><sep> (iii) to form an alliance with the MMM (preferably before the Municipal elections?); <sep><sep> it is really the sign of an optional agreement that obliges him to respect the convention, it is really not a law against the guilty, and it compensates the victims and their families. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He also helped a lot in the process of setting up the JUSTICE defense fund, which is an association that brings together victims and survivors of violence by state officers. <sep><sep> 2 cases against Lalit member Ram Seegobin have been dismissed. <sep><sep> In short, we will answer 7 other questions, before we move on to the LALIT program: <sep><sep> So far, you cannot support either Trotsky or Lenin. <sep><sep> LALIT has translated the "Introduction", a 50-year-old text, from a new book that is essential for political activists studying de facto. <sep><sep> There are only 2 crises that have been provoked by the capitalist system: <sep><sep> There was no other place, everything was double; there were tractors with grenades. <sep><sep> Thus, after 9 months of Labour retake power together with PSM and a lel MMM, renamed MSM. <sep><sep> It is regrettable and unfortunate that this self-satisfied MCIT will no longer be held accountable for all of these cases. <sep><sep> Because they diagnosed a "democracy crisis" in the years 1965-75, bourgeois ideologists have worked against this relative democratization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This falls within the framework of its political policies to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state. <sep><sep> The fact that successful governments have refused to address these three issues together has led to the grotesque pretense that the Prime Minister is currently struggling with Chagos issue. <sep><sep> There are also some measures that could be taken to limit cyclone damage. <sep><sep> The 7th grade teacher, Balram, was a good teacher. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee has started with a warm welcome, and thanked Rajni for musical interludes on the synthesizer. <sep><sep> It was a social revolution, where the regime went from a Feudal Regime to a Bourgeois Regime. <sep><sep> Together in the wilderness, there was a Blue Linen Lady naturally. <sep><sep> but a lot of money was involved in entering into the PPP (Public-Private Partnership) for energy. <sep><sep> The next Report came in 2003 with the Agriculture Minister who was previously Jug- Nauth with a Non-Sugar Strategic Plan which was a "non-starter" because there was no budget allocated for it. <sep><sep> Timi, he would take Balram's place and Balram would take care of the house with a servant they were already employing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian government should take a resolution at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly to support Mauritius' case in the International Court of Justice. <sep><sep> We find it unbelievable, whether we are happy about it or not. And then we, as political activists, can search for the working class struggle. Why is it important to search for the struggle of the working class? Because its struggle can bring about a greater enrichment of democracy. And when we have more democracy, we can decide what to plant, for example. We can decide what kind of exploitation of our land we want, what we do not want. We do not have to continue to endure what Shell, BP, Caltex, and other multinationals want, what they decide to do with the planet, as it is today. Therefore, the working class, it represents around 90% of the people on the planet today. In the last 20-30 years, almost all people in the East and the West have entered the working class - there are no more peasants - so, we have the majority of people in the working class. What Occupy Wall Street calls 99% vs. 1%. What do we want to say by people in the working class? We want to say that for a person to live, they need to sell their labor, their courage. They sell their courage. Either by the month with someone who will buy it, or through a company that will buy it, and that company is made up of people themselves. They, the other class, are called "bosses", they buy courage. <sep><sep> They will try to put them in a forced position to make a push for him to become Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, people associate him with his analysis of capitalist economy, but he has also made a lot of reflections on ecology and the environment in relation to capitalist production. <sep><sep> Experts are predicting an increase in employment in the tourism sector and SMEs, sectors that do not really create employment. <sep><sep> In 1965, when Diego was still being colonized, the existing state was a pre-colonial state, it was not free. <sep><sep> It constructed a “Historical Block” both on land and at sea, which meant it had large plantations as its true base, and small plantations as its outposts. <sep><sep> Another aspect, linked to the future of AKM, recognizes that progress has been made, until now, especially outside of the State. <sep><sep> Why should a party with 9% of the vote not be represented in Parliament? <sep><sep> to easily facilitate the storage for planting, irrigation, and fishing; f. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> * Total freedom for your organization to work with socialist who are not pro-capitalist. <sep><sep> When people ask Lalit members about language in education, we can answer one question and people will understand another thing. <sep><sep> A Budget Speech should propose a series of measures that allow the country's economy to face the crisis situation: it is not just a matter of propping up existing sectors, those same sectors that have exposed the country to this crisis series, and making the working class even more miserable. <sep><sep> Despite all the financial wizardry of Finance Minister Xavier Duval on your growth, despite his grand declarations on the "resilience" of the Mauritian economy, the working class is well aware that it is suffering the consequences of the global economic crisis and its aftermath. <sep><sep> When there are representatives from all unions, representatives from other workers' organizations, ordinary soldiers in the army, non-boss police officers, semi-clandestine, all come together to prepare a new form of democracy, calling it the “Constituent Assembly”. <sep><sep> In Tunisia, we are going towards a “Constituent Assembly”, set for 24 July this year, so mobilization continues uphill. <sep><sep> In America, if there has been a movement against finance capital, it is because tens of thousands of people in America have lost their homes. <sep><sep> When workers ask why they're not being paid, management responds that there has been a "slip-up" in the company, and many customers are not paying. <sep><sep> Mauritius has not had any elections in the countryside since 1997. <sep><sep> In 2007, LALIT submitted a critical submission on the Sexual Offenses Act to the Select Committee, where we criticize the increase in repression as the only solution that the State has. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After the Congress, there was a meeting between 16 members of the Education Commission and Neville Alexander. <sep><sep> However, in LALIT we find that clearly he has other concerns. <sep><sep> A worker in capitalist production does not work for himself, he does not do anything for himself, whether to keep for himself, or to barter. <sep><sep> He will only be a statue in the labyrinth of Tantinn Ganga, a photo in the lap of Prem and Nilou's prayers. <sep><sep> According to SMEDA President, this tightening trend will increase in 2013. <sep><sep> There was a LALIT meeting on alternative economics with an emphasis on Rodrig, a special Seminar. <sep><sep> However, this individual who breaks things, he is a bit like us in LALIT. <sep><sep> Carol Benson told him that he should talk about education that is bi-lingual or even multi-lingual and based on the mother tongue. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been a shift from political activities and political organizations to activities and organizations that do not challenge neo-liberal capitalism. <sep><sep> The women's movement in Mauritius, in the world, we are not interested in having a woman or two climb to the summit of the existing hierarchy, so that there are a couple of women among the 2-3 bosses who make decisions for us in our heads. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the best, and in the mothers and grandmothers of class workers becoming stronger (and this depends to a large extent on objective conditions, and not on our will), a union has a triple role in quality of life. <sep><sep> In this regard, both leaders, Navin Ramgoolam and Paul Bérenger, encourage and "legitimize" the various forces that support them encouraging communalism. <sep><sep> * On Saturday morning, Jenny (Canada) and I went to meet a group of women in the village of Biddya. <sep><sep> This is important in socialism because greater emancipation of women means potentially, we are gaining enough strength to participate in a political struggle. <sep><sep> He said that bourgeois political parties (like MSM, MMM, PTR, PMSD/XD etc.) vote and therefore their goal is to elect deputies and once in parliament, their role is to represent the interests of the bourgeoisie class. <sep><sep> What marked MSM is primarily the political reign of Aneerood Jugnauth. <sep><sep> Different governments, whether they worked before, whether MSM MMM now, have shifted the crisis burden from the industrial sector from employer to worker, and artisans and small-scale planters. <sep><sep> What we need to take into account in our struggle to bring more equality, in our struggle to combat injustice, in our struggle to bring security for everyone. <sep><sep> In all this instability, during these 5 years there was a musical chair for who will be the opposition leader. <sep><sep> What most upset him was the evil he was doing in his garden. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "Our closest poem is 'My Mother's warmth' by Eshan Abdool Raman. <sep><sep> Meaning, there are four large East India Companies that will ensure a single relationship with Mauritius, with each one investing more of their interest in other countries too. <sep><sep> Only when R.Seegobin presents the lyrics that he learned has he "insulted the police". <sep><sep> Firstly, they took measures to ensure the profitability of the same risky industry that is in crisis. <sep><sep> This means mainly eating, drinking, reading, and through science and discovery and innovation, they found a way to produce a series of other goods and products. <sep><sep> The government is visiting 100,000 university places, many students from outside. <sep><sep> The Police Federation has filed a complaint against Valayden for racial incitement; their position in summary is "no discrimination in police brutality". <sep><sep> They say the licences will expire on 1 Novem. <sep><sep> But, in Mauritius there were no real Marxist currents at that time. <sep><sep> This year, where the Mauritian government must act by placing an item on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly to make the Security Council take a case to The Hague. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After the Restoration, Napoleon, who managed to reverse most of the work, but it would completely prevent any religious or political influence from having any power, either political or economic. <sep><sep> They are more interested in who will be the Prime Minister, who will be the President, and what alliances need to be made for an electoral victory - without any analysis or program. <sep><sep> Today it is clear that all conventions on human rights and educational research books say that mother tongue should be used in education. <sep><sep> So Devianand Narrain went to the door to understand what is happening. <sep><sep> We want to know why in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, our children are not seeing us in our true figure and ask why we didn't take into account when we should have. <sep><sep> These ideas, however, are quickly returning to the discourse of reformists. <sep><sep> This is one of the things that in the last 20-30 years has brought about a real revolution in the concept of class struggle worldwide. <sep><sep> Instead of reflecting on the long-term future of the security industry, the ruling classes have chosen to speed up the development of the textile and tourism industry, while at the same time easing the security industry by reducing the Exit Tax. <sep><sep> Their intervention has rendered visible the limitations of constitutional rights when the State is not putting strict practices in place to ensure women's rights, strengthen security rights, and protect the freedom of movement. <sep><sep> But the movement is to regain these analyses - even if with a delay. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are facing a serious problem. <sep><sep> The former Industrial Relations Act was about the relationship between workers and employers during conflicts. <sep><sep> Now, it's time to explain this "alienation". <sep><sep> It's difficult to understand its disguised class content, its opposition to class content. <sep><sep> Along with other organizations, they have adopted measures for food security where they propose solutions to combat food crisis. They also promote renewable energy. <sep><sep> We can see that at this moment in history we are questioning our actions. <sep><sep> However, with this economic crisis, we need to prevent it from becoming another crisis today. <sep><sep> What they did not realize is that in Jericho, although appearing prosperous, a large number of people could not read. <sep><sep> Serious problems in our country are leading to social degradation where people face increasing repression and the high cost of living, they find only one alternative to survive in the face of repression while what could help society in the long run is. <sep><sep> We support the right to return and the right to reparations as fundamental rights. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Former President of the Republic Cassam Uteem, who is also a member of Solidarity with Palestine, explained how the Palestinians have been uprooted from their land. <sep><sep> There have been a series of specific points on which there have been political discussions, often with the contribution of LALIT: <sep><sep> The American government has sometimes shirked its responsibility. <sep><sep> How companies in the textile and tourism sectors can continue to make profits. <sep><sep> The current situation with the licensing of two trade unionists in Telecom. <sep><sep> When we use the appropriate tools, when we are aware of why we are mobilizing, what the demands are, when we develop our program and strategies and know where we are heading. <sep><sep> He even sent his soldiers to school to give presents to underprivileged children. <sep><sep> This is what we have reflected in this document: what is indispensable. <sep><sep> This means on a worldwide scale, but it is usually starting with the Chinese government, we will have a negative growth. <sep><sep> Minister Seebun has agreed that the police station is not an appropriate place for a woman to give her statement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, we remember that the workers produce the rice in this country. <sep> From primary school, he did not like the teacher 'sir'. <sep> For example, in 1983, the Alliance blue-white-red became popular, the Workers' Party which had the "red" in blue-white-red, it was excluded from the Alliance. <sep> As for example, I love you, I give you my love, I am pleased in your joy, I die in your grief, ... always by your side ... We laugh together forever. <sep> We will briefly look at the situation of families in this systemic crisis: <sep> Dinesh withdrew and young people took the baton in DSD which was doing an extremely original job. <sep> After that, there was a LALIT message on a balloon, in Japan. <sep> Such a position he holds in the economic interests of the bourgeoisie and at the same time he demonstrates that the MSM-MMM government, like other governments before, has no political principles and neither willingness nor political courage to reclaim the strengthening of the Diego base. <sep> Another part of it, he disagrees with that part because he understands that difference. <sep> If they do not choose a community among the four communities mentioned in this Constitution, they form a rebellion instead and they cannot stand for election in general elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We know that the French zone is called the Mediterranean Sea. <sep><sep> What everyone knows is that Forom du people it is an initiative from 2 political parties, Resistance and Alternative, and the First Me Movement, along with some NGOs that have collaborated with them. <sep><sep> Then, when the lamas hits, only one cow, he makes that rose there. <sep><sep> Their natural musical intelligence allows them to quickly absorb new ideas without losing their freshness. <sep><sep> "Where we are," a trade union worker from Union Dickry said, "The strike was almost 100% (only one woman struck, went to work before it was clear!). <sep><sep> It was a day of Lavia, so everyone had to be a little cautious. <sep><sep> In the past, Lalit had already set up the School of War, the Summer University, the Comics Workshop for Change, the School of Dispute, Political Courses, the University of Life. <sep><sep> But Diego does not understand the world of support, he thinks that if Paloma did not reappear in its world of official serpents it automatically harms and corrupts. <sep><sep> And Mauritius rupee has depreciated by 24% in 2006, while the exchange rate has decreased by 5%. <sep><sep> Which means it was a movement that had initiated a strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, more than 16 months after, the police are planning to file charges against 2 leaders of Lalit, Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> We need to challenge bureaucracy and its maneuvers that bring about fragmentation. <sep><sep> This historical event is described in the Lalit de Klas Review, and has become a better piece of Mauritian theater, Tras, by Henri Favory. <sep><sep> When there are disagreements in CSG, between Subron and Bizlall (who are in FPU), the conflict explodes in CSG, leaving the total minimization of what remains. <sep><sep> At the same time, one of the manifestations of the economic crisis is precisely the political crisis that is taking place, mainly in the Opposition, but it is also starting to happen in the Government. <sep><sep> So, what exactly should everyone rally around, and what methods are appropriate to bring everyone into action? <sep><sep> and firmly in the Vagrants Depot, which is still near the GRNW bridge, on its way to Pointe aux Sables. <sep><sep> All the families that had stopped by have now disappeared. <sep><sep> And for the first time, we have had the experience of nighttime meetings, which have gone well. <sep><sep> So I hope that together we will have 2 fantastic days ahead of us, and it will give us the courage to face things that humanity has never had to face before. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Workers gain more power, with higher positions in management working alongside workers, aiding in gaining more democratic rights and freedom in work. <sep><sep> The wind energy is more environmentally friendly compared to a power plant fueled by fossil fuels or coal. <sep><sep> Speculation and control by cartels on production and trade of food is aggravating the food crisis; <sep><sep> and society tainted by corruption, as many NGOs seem to adopt as a strategy. <sep><sep> - Minutes of an association, it is an important form of that collective memory; <sep><sep> Our country is, on that note, why was it started, why it has reigned for 200 years. <sep><sep> It has been declared that we will announce our way of participating in elections in a press conference just before Nomination Day. <sep><sep> It affects many people, and if we do not seek a way to prevent this social crisis, various other economic sectors, be it tourism, or others, they will all be threatened. <sep> 
<sep> Lalit has held a dozen neighborhood meetings on that subject in the past 3 months. <sep> But one day, the effect that you have mentioned, one day, when there is progress in that class consciousness, people will remember that. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was claiming loudly for everything that wasn't necessary. <sep><sep> SILU joining with 3-4 union GWF, to form a new federation. <sep><sep> Visit our website where you can read an extraordinary text by Rosa Luxemburg on "Capital Assimilation" (in the "Documents" section). <sep><sep> But, there was a storm brewing, about 1,200 longshoremen were about to lose their jobs. <sep><sep> There was a lot of talk about cultural identity, multiple languages, cultures, and literature. <sep><sep> When you make a decision to strike, you watch, you watch your comrades. <sep><sep> All these delegates come from different establishments, they come to report the situation that they are bringing from their Strike Committee to their establishment. <sep><sep> Naturally, there has also been opposition from the students themselves, 75 of them. <sep><sep> This means when comrade Eddy is not present in this session. <sep><sep> As for LALIT, our campaign is for an alternative economy to replace sugar and cane, for an alternative economy based on diversified agricultural production on a large scale. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>And so he was a worker of Lepor, and because three members of LALIT who were working for Lepor were present, he also made a report on the trade union situation at Lepor, among other things. <sep><sep> And section 9.5 "Which Resilient and Alternative has said, they are not raising the question of Constitutionality of the Bestloser System. <sep><sep> The last strike found a unionist to stop eating so that a single woman found at the reservoir bank a lump-sum which is higher than the total salary of the majority of women workers in their entire work life, that is 40 years. <sep><sep> For example, if CT Power is operating at Pointes aux Caves, it will need to transport charcoal from Lepor to bring it to Pointes aux Caves. <sep><sep> This will help us, in various places where we are - work, neighborhood, party, organization - intervene in a more efficient way. <sep><sep> It happens all the time, this kind of class struggle. <sep><sep> The pretext for this base is that which was ultimately consistent and slippery. <sep><sep> Lerop, 2-3 years ago, it seemed stable, but today, with a loss in the north, a loss in France, the situation is different. <sep><sep> After Cehl Meeah's arrest, then there were 4 or 5 people who were imprisoned, according to the official narrative, "suicided by swallowing poison against their leader". <sep><sep> - Uncle! - Can I help you, uncle? - Help me? - Yes, you fell on earth and red ants surrounded you. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After that, he moved to France for several years. <sep> <sep> We found this in Ralph Lauren's case, where Mauritian law allows multinational companies to invest in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> LALIT is participating in an international mobilization campaign called THE WEEK AGAINST THE APARTHEID WALL through a film projection on Palestine. <sep> <sep> The government has pledged to have at least 30% of women in Parliament in the SADC. <sep> <sep> The British government has just lost its case in the Court of Appeal against Olivier Bancoult on the issue of the right of return for the Chagossians, following the new Orders in Council 2004. <sep> <sep> You make demands, you mobilize, you negotiate, you reach a compromise. <sep> <sep> Between him and his mother, a strong emotional bond was clearly evident. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, LALIT has conducted an electoral campaign successfully. <sep> <sep> from 1976, they started work in safe industry, organizing safe industry workers, extensive work. <sep> <sep> And then all the other unions in GWF, in FTU, all of them have agreed to support this strike, with a unity strike, a general strike if necessary. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to bourgeois ideology, and its reality as well, the sociologist is a different description of social status beyond economic and political; it describes trends to keep everywhere; in each reality, it avoids talking. <sep><sep> What will happen in the Labor Party in Beau Bassin on Thursday is that they will hear that book, that is, the link between political and union matters. <sep><sep> We are publishing "Welcome Discourse" which Lindsey Collen made on October 30, the first day of the International Conference on Diego Garcia and Chagos, before he spoke as the former President of the Republic, Mr. <sep><sep> On the one hand, because the "ultimate" Lalit is equality and freedom. <sep><sep> Lindsey explained that with Lalit's proposal, in Flic en Flac school, for example, where there is a large upper-middle class where their children do not go to Flic en Flac school. <sep><sep> So we also need to think about how we will get a (critical review) stick for this program to move forward. <sep><sep> He thinks he doesn't have to work, he can. <sep><sep> Lots of good quality gas is often used by the Israeli army. <sep><sep> Samy, who liked to eat his corn, said, "Mom, when you become Prime Minister, can I get a driver job with you?" - Go play with me. <sep><sep> Editorials and other people who were protesting against Gokhool's alleged reform have seen their claims weakened by this empty document and can't compete in any way in the education system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ofet de L'Estrac has stepped down from the media network when he was named Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the weather remains sunny all day. <sep><sep> The launch was co-chaired by Alain Ah-Vee for LALIT, and Lindsey Collen for the Movement for the Liberation of Women. <sep><sep> However, despite the fact that no one had voted in favor of the book, we found an endorsement for this bipolarization. <sep><sep> Here, also, on the issue of the earth, we must resist our campaign. <sep><sep> Remember there was a caravan, where all the buses came down from Quito, through your city and villages in the Andes, to Manta on the Pacific side, and meetings were held everywhere. <sep><sep> I'm using my "articulation" here, meaning an article with another. <sep><sep> For this reason, we made this decision, we are not going to ally with any candidate; but we are going to participate in this campaign. <sep><sep> For a while there had been an approach between Fanfan Tabardenn and Dharam Raj through Per Martin King and since his arrest a sympathy for Fanfan was developing among different communities. <sep><sep> This is how we are visiting multi-linguism at a base level on matrices of mother tongues. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recently, he has become a public figure as a Bill, who has been reformed, and he had the intention of agreeing only 2 weeks for people to study him. <sep><sep> And we think that this can happen quickly. <sep><sep> Where the IRS process where there will be large areas of land that will be used for gardening, domestic, culinary, gardening, golf field entrance entertaining services for billionaires, will have a new form of quasi-feudal alienation. <sep><sep> We will mainly talk about our Strategy Conference which will take place on Monday, March 12th, and which concerns the anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist strategic system. <sep><sep> When we look at society nowadays, for example through newspapers, radio, or as shown in schools or universities, it seems like we are looking at the sea from there, to understand its movements. <sep><sep> And when different groups in the bushes come together they get this more general idea where the "class struggle" is going at a given moment. <sep><sep> There will no longer be, nor will there be, class struggle. <sep><sep> He says it is a phenomenon that promotes communalism through a false link between politics and religion. <sep><sep> When Roland Fozoo went on the 30th of November, the Mayor was rescheduled for today, December 4. <sep><sep> Acting chairman of the Central Committee for "political horizons", taking everyone, presiding, making minutes, taking care of correspondence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the reality of work Be that meeting, it is to understand the reality of work for women as it is today, with materials to understand it well enough to develop a program effectively. <sep><sep> And he put it into practice in the Ramlogun case. <sep><sep> From 2005, Workers have developed a platform called "Economic Democratization": it is on the basis of this platform that it has come to power, particularly giving a communitarian coloration and sometimes racism to this concept. <sep><sep> The boss is making it worse today, on Independence Day, as we are finding in the media. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have the phenomenon of Wanted, which has brought together 15,000 internet users, then an individual, Noor Adam Essack, made a shopping list of demands. <sep><sep> Globally, there are two major problems: an indefinite general economic crisis and a climate catastrophe looming. <sep><sep> b) When we say "control", we mean the power to make decisions (ultimately) on how to use this stock, even if the stock was created by everyone, or by many, by many others. <sep><sep> The paper particularly focused on ;(1) The state and nature of the development of international capitalism, that is, imperialism, today,(2). The nature and degree of organization of the working class in each national country, today. <sep><sep> A petition has been sent to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education to demand the introduction of Kreol as a mother tongue, as a medium in schools to show the importance of subjects like Science, Mathematics, History, Geography. <sep><sep> So, every week, always, a day each week we meet here, LALIT members, that is, more than our Central Committee meeting, we meet now and then until tonight, we bring our food here and finish our role-playing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In South Africa, for example, the government often puts cooperatives in the spotlight for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). <sep><sep> It's a class struggle discussing who speaks the truth, lies, good, bad, suggesting something good, by good. <sep><sep> The press is questioning Veena Dholah's resignation from MLF and LPT. <sep><sep> Comrade Yves: It's only to say when you say sub-prime in the USA it caused enough disaster to have a direct impact. <sep><sep> There is much debate on these issues in Marxist literature. <sep><sep> He was fighting the political mirror called "Raison d'État". <sep><sep> Let me make a comparison, to show the difference between two demands in the face of unemployment: Microcredit, if you make this demand, it takes workers' families from the formal sector to the informal sector. <sep><sep> But meanwhile, when you believe this, you believe it's useless to fight against social inequality, then you get an ideological roadblock. <sep><sep> And our suggestion is aimed at encouraging re-nationalization but in a voluntary manner. <sep><sep> Today there are 4,637 Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli military prisons, including 320 in administrative detention, which allows the Israeli army to arrest people without any charges or trial. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, we are asking all electors to vote against MSM-MMM by casting a blank vote. <sep> <sep> Other activities: LALIT had organized a conference with the trade union workers last week featuring a screening of John Pilger's documentary, The War you Don’t See. <sep> <sep> This will result in the creation of a stage on a vast and fast track! <sep> <sep> If tomorrow the army besieges your house, you will no longer have a place to stay. <sep> <sep> Tell me if we want we can also conquer another place. <sep> <sep> There, there are many talented jazz musicians dedicating their time to train a new generation of jazz musicians each year. <sep> <sep> Its greatest power is that it still has the capacity to determine what will happen politically, and it does so mainly through the influence it holds in the media. <sep> <sep> Private companies are increasing their prices in front of their services and products, covering that subsidy to propagate information, light. <sep> <sep> What happens is when work pressure rises, workers have no way to reduce the problem, so they step without knowledge, one after the other. <sep> <sep> This makes it a form of state where the bourgeoisie has just suffered a political defeat (after 76 and 82), where it is not well represented politically and where the working class can no longer assume power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Playgroups have also joined LPT's call to demand that the mother tongue in Mauritius is used as the official language in Parliament. <sep><sep> You will find it very helpful to read the article "Data Bourgeoisie - What it is?" by Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> This report highlights the ideas and experiences that participants in the course have benefited from during these 4 days. <sep><sep> Because the boss can make a profit from it, but when there is a crisis, the Government will immediately block exports, as well. <sep><sep> After contributing to the economy, we are now being told to go back home. <sep><sep> The Committee on Political Party Financing is taking action. <sep><sep> At the same time, I will explain the concept of "data bourgeoisie" (this bourgeoisie made up of capitalist communities often confused, which are being created and strengthened by state power) which has been in power since the universal suffrage, with the concept of "historical block", which Gramsci developed and which explains this network of class alliances that the dominant bourgeoisie is obliged to weave to stabilize itself. <sep><sep> The Academy will naturally be built on existing work, work that has been done over time. <sep><sep> This text is based on notes from Alain Ah-Vee for the LALIT Strategic Seminar, Ziyet 2012. <sep><sep> But, the Mauritian Government pretends that there must be a "secret" strategy for this issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Neville Alexander, who Mauritian knows because he came to animate a conference, All Workers' Conference, and also, another time, a Public Lecture on Workers' Education. <sep><sep> And, in addition, we have given considerable effort to establish a military base here. <sep><sep> But now, who knows where this part of our working conditions came from. <sep><sep> The class struggle in every country influences the way the state forms, evolves, and functions in that country. <sep><sep> It is a systemic crisis, a crisis affecting our net system. <sep><sep> For example, a small increase in income tax, exemption from tax on the first 60 tons, "duty free" on 4 X 4s, but these measures are quite frivolous when faced with real difficulties in this sector. <sep><sep> The matter has become quite serious, and it will be a difficult confrontation. <sep><sep> Now he must become a medium for the teaching of exact sciences, history, geography, computer science, etc. <sep><sep> He will reorganize new sites within the country. <sep><sep> He said the program should include immediate demands and also call for a general sanction in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We will also launch a debate on how to address social issues such as drugs, without just relying on repression as the Government is currently doing. <sep><sep> Children in remote villages where there were no primary schools had to walk long distances from early morning to get a glimpse of learning to read, write and count without forgetting the unpleasant surprises on their way for any mistakes. <sep><sep> Because we say "Yes, it is making statements", "Yes, it is proposing a resistance" against the worst of globalization. <sep><sep> It is producing electricity with cane, 60% of Mauritius' electricity is produced by historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee will speak in this session, right after the Former President of the Republic. <sep><sep> I agree that what begs the question is why a certain faction has said they will continue to fight in certain sectors. <sep><sep> It would have been interesting to know as a professional, is it normal for him to vandalize the entetes and logos of Lalit which are on our party's website Home Page. <sep><sep> His interest is not in the development of children, but rather in the development of the interests of sectors. <sep><sep> There was L'Estrac, there was Jugnauth, there was Nababsing, this kind of people in MMM's direction, and they haven't changed much afterwards, they're already as they were rich. <sep><sep> From now in this new millennium, we should focus more on a complete overhaul of matrimonial laws in order to remove all the remains of Christian integrists, while also ensuring that both men and women are fully recognized in matrimonial law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (We organize sub-titling in either English or French, depending on the member's request.) We decided together which movie we will present today. <sep><sep> There have been attacks against Ministers who have been implicated in various scandals: Bunwaree and Bappoo in the MITD scandal, Aimee for his brutality towards his niece, Martin for his responsibility on the issue of abuse in children's homes, Seetaram for conflict of interest in the renewable energy contract, Varma for his strong statements after accidents, Bachoo for the flood and road accident issues and finally Jeetah for conflict of interest in the tertiary education sector. <sep><sep> PT needs to reform MMM, so they can impose accountability, then MMM will be blamed for it. <sep><sep> After many formal discussions and intense debates, we have decided to hold the conference in Ecuador in March 2007. <sep><sep> Before Caracas was known as a city plagued with many violent incidents. <sep><sep> LALIT activists have contributed to the movement to liberate Chagos. <sep><sep> When we say NHRC is "independent", we are not only talking about financing. <sep><sep> We wrote to Greenpeace to ask them, "What are you gaining? Is it worth it?" Then Greenpeace's enemies began to change their tune. <sep><sep> Firstly, there has been a widespread swing against MMM-MSM, which means many people who left MMM-MSM are heading towards L'Alliance Sociale. <sep><sep> While you are starting your strike, and telling me you haven't decided yet on the size. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Why? - You were in the ocean with the other kids the other day. <sep><sep> LPT is also organizing a working group on terminology and pedagogy. <sep><sep> He enjoyed it, as the ad was saying. <sep><sep> It can be a stepping stone, when we allow people to engage in their mother tongue. <sep><sep> These are some of the things that struck me the first time I visited Palestine. <sep><sep> In China, I saw, 75% of people are against those foreign bases. <sep><sep> We have a single marriage law for everyone; we do not agree with any "personal laws." <sep><sep> Zorz says: There are 2 branches in Port Louis, a cross at night, a game. <sep><sep> This means a family cannot live if not many people are working. <sep><sep> All these sanctions mean that the proper context should support the strengthening of the Diego Garcia base and Chagos decolonization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, these 20 contestants will also be subject to democratic voting control forever. <sep><sep> These alliances will continue in a new phase. <sep><sep> Starting in 1979, a group within the MMM called "Lel Gos" (in which there were Madan Dulloo, Jack Bizlall, Habib Mosaheb, Rama Poonoosamy, Rajiv Servansing, (f) Siven Chinien) publicly emerged with a program for self-reliance. <sep><sep> Our lament, we have no democratic control over whether it is being created or not. <sep><sep> And it is interesting; we find that communalism, communal reflex, it brings many advantages and interests to the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Lalit maintains that there is no a "prima facie" clear case against it, and it never ends. <sep><sep> Kisna (from Cher): I believe that this morning's session has especially helped us understand more. <sep><sep> Clash between the army of President Mahinda Rajapakse regime and the separatist group Tamil Tigers (TT) continues to cause the death of civilian population. <sep><sep> Hence, the fact that so many different people are joining forces, it hints at a new power in the movement - which seems like a force with a purpose. <sep><sep> It is not for a simple reason: if a country's worker values their real work, their life for them, it will be impossible for their employer to make a profit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The law abolished all rights you had last year, by law. <sep><sep> For example, in 1983-1984 where there was a slideshow called "Disc, What Future?" which the government of MSM-Travayis-PMSD prohibited. <sep><sep> At the same time, when Ramgoolam made this statement, he stressed that he had not discussed this with his colleagues yet. <sep><sep> Often referred to as "New Labour" (however, I noticed that after the Eta-de-Lye, when we began to hear N.Ramgoolam say that PT and MMM have the same history!). <sep><sep> Voting for Lalit will help determine the power relations that will exist and that workers, youth, and poor people will not bear the brunt of the crisis to come. <sep><sep> But at no time did any of these countries deviate when we put forward the resolution to say that we are only claiming what will belong to the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> We also find it counter-productive to propose the Best Loser communal draw, as if there is a proportional dose, meaning an Electoral Reform. <sep><sep> But, in this phase, since we launched our film "FOR AN ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL ECONOMY", even if systemic crisis is still looking at us in the face, there have been many important sanctions. <sep><sep> But, this trench warfare is forced on him. <sep><sep> Timi knew there was something wrong with him, but he was wrong with them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The CSG-Solidarité, they claim to be at the forefront of the working class, they claim to be leading the working class, and then expose this type of weakness. <sep><sep> Fondaumiere, Ribet, Huet, Feillafe, etc.) in the press, among professors, civil service, in the judiciary. <sep><sep> It is the historic mission of the working class to end the capitalist system." IWW was not only established in America, it also had branches in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and England. <sep><sep> Thus, when promotions are given, teachers will become Deputy Head Teachers, or Deputy Head Teachers will become Heads of Department or Inspectors. <sep><sep> On Tuesday, 25th September 2007, the University of Mauritius launched for the first time an Introductory Course to Creole Languages. <sep><sep> In this way, they are implementing a linguistic policy in schools that is not compatible with the spirit of the Constitution and goes against all the International Conventions to which Mauritius has adhered. <sep><sep> Bérenger has been accused of double-speak concerning the language issue (to use a term from George Orwell). <sep><sep> Most of the funds will not go to the Ministry of Agriculture but will be invested in a private company to set up a business producing food in Madagascar and Mozambique. <sep><sep> It will quickly cut the branches and leaves from the top down. <sep><sep> They didn't take it seriously at the time. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are not getting any other points, so they support themselves on the collective fight against "drugs and violence" to take a position which, when properly looked at, risks exacerbating the problem of drugs and violence. <sep><sep> The Historical Block was not enough, based on a little more "Bonapartism", which focuses on a few other social classes, as well as what the PT focuses on: <sep><sep> In Mauritius, about 80% of Franco-Mauritians have nothing to sell except their courage, except their labor force. <sep><sep> Personally, I acknowledge that there are many people who are doing their job with their soul and conscience but corruption and protectionism corrupt some people who are creating this situation. <sep><sep> e.g., Aden in Yemen, Ref. Arming and Disarming the Indian Ocean, A CDIO Publication, 1983. <sep><sep> It makes it develop together, which we call a "protocol." <sep><sep> Our classic campaign, such as meetings, meetings, and fashion campaigns, have all gone well. <sep><sep> Now it seems that Ramgoolam had already decided to ally with the MSM, either since the presidency mandate of Anerood Jugnauth had been renewed, or since the Workers had supported the election of Pravind Jugnauth in Partial No.8 in 2009. <sep><sep> There were members of the First International sitting in the Paris Communist Government. <sep><sep> They have not passed the checkpoint and are in Salfit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mr. Tsang Ping was a MCB employee who was fired because he was claiming his rights on a controversial account linked to MCB itself. 
<sep><sep> So, all these classes operating in the sugar and fisheries sectors had and still have, their networks together. 
<sep><sep> Among other unions, outside the General Workers' Federation (GWF), where SILU and UASI were affiliated, and who were within the GWF. 
<sep><sep> We are against this "Big Brother" system where the State controls everything. 
<sep><sep> There is a lot of detail, but on a ground that does not even know where. 
<sep><sep> So much so that with the help of Lalit's struggle (Lalit de Klas at-lepok), in August 1979, workers were able to make the longest and largest general strike in Mauritian history. 
<sep><sep> So, when you interrupt someone's speech or friend's development, you are making them tell everybody. 
<sep><sep> It forces the bourgeois State first, before taking political power. 
<sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna say they were greatly impressed by the deeper analysis of Venezuelan studies. 
<sep><sep> One day he decided to tell his mother that he liked a boy, a teacher like him, and that they had decided to get married. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In addition, there may be a certain amount of parties that participate in elections, which may prevent any party from gaining 10%. <sep><sep> Michel de Speville, director of the company Food & Allied, for example, publicly advocated for diversification based on increasing food security, which would lead to more economic independence by reducing imports, keeping inflation low, and gaining greater added value. <sep><sep> This book raises questions about the role of state institutions, the role of citizens and government officials in the case of Kaya. <sep><sep> MMM also recruits deputy Shekar Naidu and Joe Lesjongard from MSM. <sep><sep> But everything is messed up in VRAK, it is merchandising and capital, everything. <sep><sep> The mother tongue weighs people down when it enters the formal and political domains, and, in so doing, raises power issues. <sep><sep> A balance must circulate for the transportation of the sick, injured, a family going to accuse. <sep><sep> It must challenge the existence of BIOT, and it must challenge the existence of the same base. <sep><sep> - We also note that there are no comments from PTr on the Collendavelloo Report, except for some extreme "doctors" like Sithanen, who are being published in the press. <sep><sep> Elections and the right to vote are a good thing, it is a good thing for everyone. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Compensation for salt producers and PRB has not made any great efforts to maintain the standard of living. <sep><sep> We proposed LALIT to create a State of Emergency situation for food in LALIT. <sep><sep> Today there are nuclear arms race, and this is against the Treaty Pelindaba for a Nuclear-Free Africa. <sep><sep> When we are in conflict, Mr. Roy only closeshis workers' union commission, unfortunately, to us outside. <sep><sep> We find it in Latin America and today in France (mobilization of workers and students against the First Labor Contract). <sep><sep> In the cadre-school we used power-point and film. <sep><sep> In another session this afternoon, Ram Seegobin will talk about the concept of class struggle and class consciousness in realpolitik LALIT. <sep><sep> So, because of their "exile", clearly they have a duty towards the rights of everyone. <sep><sep> Today, many are accepting that we need to get back our economy, not just blindly pursuing Europe for exports. <sep><sep> With privatization, the burden of family responsibility for home maintenance is increasing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We know that the textile sector is also a sector in great difficulty. <sep><sep> Comrade Jayen Chellum, you all know my participation in it. <sep><sep> We had a chance, with 3,000-4,000 with 150 years of union experience, we had transport workers, we had a big sector, who were the working class. <sep><sep> In fact, it is not surprising that there is this movement, either in one direction or another, either right now or just before an election. <sep><sep> PMSD is a party that is happy to evolve within the State, in alliances and governmental coalitions. <sep><sep> It is a union that can unite other classes with the working class against capital. <sep><sep> William Hague gives his speech in public, but the interest of the British State is decided by the various dignitaries and officials in the Foreign Office, the diplomats, the MPs, the dignitaries and officials. <sep><sep> Before that, the Military Allegiance, which had seized power by a coup d'état after the election of the FIS, an Islamist party, in 1992, was already acting in a repressive manner to provide the development of a terrorist network in the Sahara. <sep><sep> The social class (in the way we use it) did not really exist. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin analyzed the situation in Mauritius, and briefly in the world, while Alain Ah-Vee has given a report on what LALIT has done in 2012. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The main issue is that all Governments since Independence have been the same, including Ramgoolam senior, Jugnauth, Berenger, Ramgoolam junior, they are all too eager to claim their power in a way that will benefit them. <sep><sep> A President chooses someone who has won votes from a single constituency. <sep><sep> But, he was a kind of sympathetic scientist himself, a Marxist scientist. <sep><sep> It doesn't seem to have a strong link just between consecutive years of imprisonment, but between longer sentences for an offense, and decreasing the number of offenses within that phase, what the English call "deterrent value". <sep><sep> Neither did anyone know that there was a second party controlled by Cehl Meeah, FPM. <sep><sep> And he was on the team that went to different unions in GWF to convince them of the importance of the entire working class being in a strike. <sep><sep> We have an organizational problem with some meetings being too long because of the busy work hours of several members. <sep><sep> People in general know that "Leta" means more than that. <sep><sep> It is noteworthy that as the working class started buzzing, its creative capacity increased incredibly. <sep><sep> Gardens full of beautiful flowers, laughter resounding on the shore, and there was always a good lunch that was satisfying their appetites. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and until he responds to the need for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> Israel was created in this imperialist logic to divide and control the markets between the imperialist countries, through Israel. <sep><sep> Since that time, a great conflict has arisen between the Government and the MSPA, that is the Establishment. <sep><sep> They remain calm when Israel continues to encourage colonization in the West Bank. <sep><sep> And there are also completely immoral ways they use to advertise: offering people "freedom" through a product, tempting with freedom that everyone feels they "need". <sep><sep> One of the aims, however, was that the minorities formed another party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party. <sep><sep> What we are proposing takes into consideration the reality in which people live today. <sep><sep> We have reached a point where the Seychellois are becoming senseless. <sep><sep> In this way, we can prevent the State from hiding behind "lack of evidence". <sep><sep> Today there are multinationals from India, China, America, South Korea, from European countries that have gained access to surface materials in Africa. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Just like there is no universal religion, there is no universal language. <sep><sep> Then private corporations get a new place to invest, a new market for their products. <sep><sep> Cataract in the eyes, wax in the ears continue to wander in their paradise. <sep><sep> Twentieth century Africa, South America and we know the feeling of our South American brothers. <sep><sep> It also uses its hand only, to write, to use computers, to work as an engineer, doctor, whatever work. <sep><sep> So, today's demand is now a mother tongue as a medium, a mother tongue in Parliament, a mother tongue for the collective memory of our association, that is to keep the minutes of the association. <sep><sep> And it's a funny irony when, to prevent against these catastrophic consequences of climate change due to gas emissions. <sep><sep> This year there was also a phenomenon Wanted: 15,000 Youngsters, a Facebook trend, where Jameel Peerally and some private individuals are involved. <sep><sep> But there was an event that clearly showed that DSD had a great potential for the future. <sep><sep> So other people can come back to this "Terra nulla". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Otherwise, the child has a tendency to resort to a very basic level of linguistic competence, Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills. <sep><sep> The crisis has given rise to a particular expression in Molène St Felix. <sep><sep> This book sought to align with Marxist ideas. <sep><sep> We are pleased to publish papers that Alain Ah-Vee and Ram Seegobin presented at a conference on strategies organized by LALIT on March 12. <sep><sep> This represents a punishment in the delicate balance of forces in the country. <sep><sep> This was well described by Karl Marx 150 years ago, and these crises weakened the capitalist system by 80 bananas thereafter. <sep><sep> This came about in these transactions not least. <sep><sep> Police force is also beneficial, apart from a few individuals within who tarnish its reputation by beating. <sep><sep> Today, April 6, 2006, at a Press Conference, a representative of Lalit described the unstable situation where politics, where the opposition has emerged victorious from a battle between the two dynastic sections of the Jugnauths. <sep><sep> This is a new issue to focus on "permissions". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We said that Alepok has all the signs that it will be a Labour-MMM government. <sep><sep> From 5:30 am to 5:45 am, all workers gather while the unionists gather before work begins. <sep><sep> These tears, they don't cry tears of sorrow, but tears for what we have lost, tears for what we have found, what we know, possibly during these 3 weeks. <sep><sep> Our three Sadous had finished exchanging telepathic messages between them. <sep><sep> People were surprised by the number of tickets that the MSM party had received in the last general elections for a very small party that Shakeel Mohamed called. <sep><sep> Each of our teeth can have a different use, and among us, we have multiple concerns. <sep><sep> Then, on Saturday, 14 Ziyet, there will be a session on a class policy that is not electoral politics, not civil society politics. <sep><sep> The meeting was at the Tokyo camp, and when you arrive at the camp, you find the pavilion too long and the banner waiting for you. <sep><sep> The strike in the sugar industry is difficult because you have workers who are scattered all over Mauritius. <sep><sep> An institutional conflict has erupted between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank Governor on the link between reducing economic growth and the value of the rupee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today at eleven in the morning, Ally Hosenbokus filed his candidacy for the by-election in Port Louis Maritim and Port Louis Est, under the Lalit name. <sep><sep> On one hand, there is the problem with the beach (and the workers who depend on the beach and accept to give him in this system). <sep><sep> He is selling his work ethics, but worries to what extent capitalists are gaining control over his personal life. <sep><sep> Or is a dispensary fixing him in a way to expose the absurdity of Miray and to say that Miray is just for short-term and life needs to be organized for the long term, for a life when there is no more miray and more occupation. <sep><sep> Education for Workers (Mauritius) won the UNESCO 2004 International Literacy Prize. <sep><sep> Maybe he can propose that the Social Alliance needs to change its electoral slogan to "putting your 'community' first! <sep><sep> Thus, many families are transformed into a single pot of criminals. <sep><sep> The Campaign Against Miray did not manage to stop the proliferation of miray but only managed to push miray even further. <sep><sep> Similarly, why many theoretical and activist books today put words on the monopoly of bourgeois and imperialist on the media, tertiary education, and cultural production. <sep><sep> But, the legal framework to work, that's another thing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The crisis that has affected both China and Europe, had negative effects on Mauritius and its economic ties with different powerful regimes around the world.<sep> But what's even more ironic is that when there is an "offer" for another service to be sold or liberalized, it is not the Mauritian government that decides.<sep> It is a form of infiltration, where a political party has its members in unions, federations, and does work like this.<sep> There are risks associated with the proliferation of GMOs, food production becoming more under control of multinational private companies like Monsanto and Novartis.<sep> With all these measures, we are also ensuring that the police have less power over youth in the countryside.<sep> But at the end of the day, they knew they had to put on a show.<sep> So, LALIT, like everyone else, agrees that the group "WANTED" should express this desire for punishment, and start this willingness to impose it.<sep> Either this money is used to pay for the contact's debt (disguised as Rs 4,000 for store rights) or for exorbitant rent (like Rs 10,000) for a nocturnal meeting, or as a simple donation of money to a "handler" for food.<sep> If anyone finds it too much, we should not consider it a theft, but just take a handful and move on.<sep> Newspaper distribution in La-Havann via bicycle, and then on foot in the streets of Kiba via train. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MSM/MMM have identified a location to launch a process for the reinforcement of democracy and fundamental rights of citizens. <sep><sep> Per Martin King was speaking with Kamini. <sep><sep> This morning we received a message from comrade Alain saying "The 14-year-old boy has been released." <sep><sep> Today, we have initiated and coordinated different types of actions to officially recognize the Creole and Bhojpuri languages: <sep><sep> The government should enact laws to compel landowners to stop acting as "rentiers" and start developing their plantations in their entirety. <sep><sep> And now, let’s look at the definition of "economy", i.e. GDP, in Marxist terms. <sep><sep> The most prominent pro-capitalist analyst in the world is saying this. <sep><sep> But to Minister Baichoo, you will need to pay attention. <sep><sep> Hence considering this social reality, it is the influence that we choose, the strictness of the sentences we use. <sep><sep> There are several Lalit militants who have experienced personally the brutal and illegal methods that some police officers use. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The C. took photos and compiled detailed files for each family similar to the Housing Movement in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Work is becoming scarcer and many sectors are recruiting based on contracts. <sep> <sep> And only 10 deputies, MMM have never been as strong in the National Assembly; each time it has made alliances with either MSM or Labor, MMM has abandoned half of the municipal council seats. <sep> <sep> He published a book that exposed Stalin, and other revolutionary leaders. <sep> <sep> Electoral reform is on hold, all discussions have been put on hold for now. <sep> <sep> He was bringing light, he was explaining, only on the issue of reparations and the rights of the Chagossians. <sep> <sep> At the beginning, I said that we would look at the problems. <sep> <sep> Like Yosi suspected that something was going on in the heads of the Sadou, he wanted to put all the cards on the table. <sep> <sep> As part of a campaign on an economic alternative, LALIT is organizing a session on Marxist Economics. <sep> <sep> But the Israeli economy depends on the export of goods, there are workers on strike in Palestine and there are Palestinian villages surrounded by walls where Israel is. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And what include individuals such as MCB boss, Pipo Forget, who is also a boss at the newspaper L’Express. <sep><sep> So, big conflicts in the industry when we have been finding since 2007 still unresolved. <sep><sep> Through their branches, through their activists, there has been a lot of support from MMM through the Ilois OF Committee, and MMM itself. <sep><sep> Pledging for a Nuclear-Free Africa was signed in a place called Pelindaba in South Africa, and it had symbolic significance. <sep><sep> Another challenge faced by Seegum, no success, he took his union and went to CITU. <sep><sep> This measure has another aspect: it strengthens the government and employers' control over labor. <sep><sep> In Lalit, as the press already knows, we are campaigning for a process of decolonization and reunification of our Republic, and our Conference is focused on it. <sep><sep> From many African countries, individuals head to Morocco, where millions of people are waiting to find a way across the Mediterranean Sea, to sneak into Italy, Spain, France as illegal immigrants. <sep><sep> Instead of diversifying agriculture for food security and increasing profitability of agricultural land, Security Companies have continued to plant sugarcane and at the same time invested in textile and tourism industries to ensure short-term profits. <sep><sep> But it also means that Mr. Raddhoa will not be here to respond, he will not be here to defend himself in front of society, in a series of police brutality cases. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, this block is also present in her, different interests in different socio-economic classes, which include political parties, trade unions, frequent eating places, an economic sector. <sep> <sep> We still remember the time of the "boom cigar" in the mid-70s, which very quickly transformed into a very serious economic crisis towards the end of the 70s, after a massive increase in the price of oil on the world market: <sep> <sep> This sanction will contribute to the stabilization of formal Creole reserves. <sep> <sep> But the American Government says it was happy to ratify the Pelindaba Protocol. <sep> <sep> In 3rd grade they will return ID at 17:00. <sep> <sep> For the Court, there will be a Magistrate, and if too much disorder, there will be the Army, and there will be a bullet on it. <sep> <sep> He discussed the possibility of creating many jobs and quickly. <sep> <sep> *Barack Obama's election is also a victory against "laissez-faire" unbridled capitalism, which has reigned since the time of Ronald Reagan. <sep> <sep> So this committee already has something on which it can start working. <sep> <sep> No one will care if he gets it more or less than Rs20,000 per month. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When they come in a group with their hats and shawls. <sep><sep> This is how bourgeois reigns, through a such historical block. <sep><sep> Similar to the insanity, populist leaders like Khadaafi, they too, lead anti-political movements in many parts of the world, including Mauritius. <sep><sep> What characterizes MSM is a funny thing for a political party. <sep><sep> The additional massive debt that the industry has gained through depreciation of the Seychelles. <sep><sep> It starts from the French Revolution which has been hijacked, taking this religious symbol and now there are many millions of people looking for a religious state. <sep><sep> Is Israel, through the peace process in Annapolis, preparing something to strengthen its position in negotiations? <sep><sep> They represent the claims by the Chagossians, while the British government remains silent. <sep><sep> In the city center, on all sides, the large main streets have trees like privet trees around 8 feet tall - their trunks are white and their leaves are blue in a circle. <sep><sep> All its waters, by almost everyone in the region is planted with sugar cane / sarees. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT's position regarding reparations and compensation for slavery is very different from the Greens' demands. <sep> It is as if we are very sick and need an operation, but we are being treated for a mental illness (or vice versa). <sep> He observed you, he notes, he experiences, he records. <sep> Until he appears only concerned with his demands in the public sector, but he can also look at the private sector. <sep> Sir Ralph and Ganga made promises to meet once a year, on the anniversary of Ganga, in a restaurant because Sir Ralph had to check what Ganga was feeding his body, not just his mind. <sep> And on sime dimoun par tonn it was going on. <sep> What we normally understand by the class struggle, it is forms that are at the same time collective and conscious. <sep> And a political party, it also provides the means to promote its program, to make people aware of how its program will be implemented. <sep> In this sense, he has given our programmatic work much more depth and political rigor. <sep> The MSM-MMM government paid for this kind of politics. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One of the best union leaders I've ever known was the Galvabond union, with its 37 members out of 39 workers in the plant. <sep><sep> In 1983 and 1987, when they won twice in a row, there were Minister resignations by plot. <sep><sep> Now everyone is becoming aware of this reality. <sep><sep> Almost all vegetable markets advertise on the radio. <sep><sep> Either way, the size is not so important: once my strike began, there was a "Support Committee for the End of the Jabaljas Strike". <sep><sep> In 2005, the Workers' Party had 36 deputies, while by 2010, when it allied with MSM and PMSD after the election, it only won 29 deputies. <sep><sep> Anerood Jugnauth resigned as President of the Republic and began discussions with MMM on the Remake 2000 project. <sep><sep> But they abandoned it when they had a strong opinion and publicly proclaimed their ideological allegiance, either by running for election or by participating in debate forums, as there are today. <sep><sep> a private Singapore company that will install servers and terminals that read these cards, so it will have potential access. <sep><sep> If you start a business, you don't have to wait more than 3 days, just start it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Naturally, we should all realize that this is a decision that has changed all our lives. <sep><sep> The economic crisis in Europe has several aspects: massive layoffs by the governments in countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal, and others; massive unemployment, which has exceeded 20% in Spain, for example. <sep><sep> One of the main concerns of our campaign is that the rights of people in rural villages are at stake. <sep><sep> All this is starting to resemble predictions made by the great Marxist theorists before 1920. <sep><sep> They are clearly revealing the crisis in Iran over its nuclear program. <sep><sep> * European money must be used to create jobs, not destroy them! <sep><sep> It is a new conspiracy similar to the conspiracies of the 1960s and 1970s, which have been described with such precision mainly in a series of documents from the British Courts since 2000. <sep><sep> and in practice it understands and agrees to confront this resistance, which will rise when it mobilizes and organizes to achieve satisfaction of the demands, when it opposes this ideology. <sep><sep> Today, in Mauritius, in the midst of the crisis, we must seize the opportunity to create this Program. <sep><sep> Finally, the class struggle is largely internal, it is in relation to people's experiences. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He, Yosi and their group went to gather all the children who were still alive. <sep> <sep> "On the 40th

Then he said, "You are going to lay down your life in gratitude for all that, but the 40th week is not a problem. <sep> <sep> There are several artists who have created works, whether they are paintings, sculptures, or installations on this theme. <sep> <sep> 1,000 Kreol Awards to be distributed, with all delegates, all workers who wish to have labor law in this sector, they had a version of this law in Kreol. <sep> <sep> He was proud and happy that it was like that. <sep> <sep> And now, whether it is in Mauritius or in other countries, we are all fighting for a better, free, equal society, without exploitation, where light and ecology continue to shine! <sep> <sep> We must also remember that after the election, Berenger told him to find Ramgoolam to look at certain corruption issues - some of them involved tourism. <sep> <sep> In September, we began to have situations where agriculture was being taken over, where multinational companies were entering into the biotechnology of genetically modified organisms. <sep> <sep> When analyzing the results, among the 16 female candidates in the 2 blocks, 7 came out first in their group. <sep> <sep> Also, it seems that there is a problem with Madun Dulloo, where people are surprised that he has not gone to Lasinn, given that he was given the Minister of Foreign Affairs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means their system is so anchored that they need to analyze it, not to pass, or to say the word. <sep><sep> We have shot some documentaries: "12 Measures for the People", "Precise and Discreet" (2006), Rupee Depreciation: Who is Responsible? <sep><sep> With the restrictions on the sugar industry, there is a new formation of companies like Omnicane where for the first time SIT and NPF have shares (35% for SIT and 10.09% for NPF). <sep><sep> Other companies, like Flacq Long Mountain Bus Service, were closing down. <sep><sep> It may have other advantages, I have not yet found it, me. <sep><sep> In each village, in each suburb, the family association sets up - with two main policies (voting rights) and secondary education. <sep><sep> Below is a summary of a Speech by Lindsey Collen at a meeting of LALIT members on Saturday, January 31, 2010. <sep><sep> Likewise we say it is a transitional demand, where we are addressing today's labor/social problems and at the same time working to strengthen our position in the struggle for equality in society <sep><sep> A State College had become a gateway for social mobility for a middle-class section, especially in agriculture, merchants, farmers, small traders. <sep><sep> The boss easily replaces a delegate, a union leader. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a big problem of competition going on, with the actual problem being that many children are struggling to learn to read and write and lack a high level of literacy after years of schooling. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen commented on the handling of the election by the MMM/MSM government and criticized their behavior and lack of respect for the electorate in Constituency No.3. <sep><sep> There is no unanimity, with some in favor of it and others not believing it to be too important. <sep><sep> A government has a duty to treat all children equally. <sep><sep> He told Lalit Press reporters that he had been beaten. <sep><sep> They have also focused on replacing all the political nominees of the former government and the end of contracts for many workers recruited by the former government during the general election campaign. <sep><sep> It is a system that makes ALL deputies in parliament representatives of a particular communal entity. <sep><sep> Paloma only makes a mistake, makes a noise, and tries to hide where it is most destroying its bonds and seasoning like salt, therefore it is no longer salting. <sep><sep> But it's too long to look at that today but in the State book (edited by Rajni Lallah) there is an article by Ram Seegobin that explains in detail and even writes a hymn to the first founders of the Advance Group. <sep><sep> More importantly, does the government have the right to lease the country's land for 99 years to a private company, off the premises? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But there are also internal political factors responsible for the chaos in the Government: the prolonged absence of Ramgoolam during a critical period, but also his preoccupation with matters that have nothing to do with Government's political affairs. <sep><sep> The physical markets, dances, circus, and maxims were not happy. <sep><sep> But, the amendment passed, with amendments, in April. <sep><sep> It was impossible to face such a crisis with a Sithanen-style plan, that is to say "Make Mauritius Business-Friendly"! <sep><sep> The LALIT Members Assembly for the year-end review made in the Grand Rivyer Nord Wes Zone on the Chairmanship of Kistnasamy Rada on Sunday, 20 December at 2pm. <sep><sep> There is no indication that this negotiation on wages will involve all transport workers, or whether it only applies to CNT workers. <sep><sep> Are people who create such discussions trying to create problems in the country? <sep><sep> Plantation Workers' Union (labour union; Jugdambi Roy then), which had organized sugar cane workers within the Historical Bloc - had stabilized the Bloc in all the labourer zones, villages, and even cities. <sep><sep> The content was well varied, between frivolity and sophisticated inner strife that was linked with local political events. <sep><sep> So, they were the social base of PT. And they embodied the ideologies created by the large planters, and the State Bourgeoisie together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the other hand, ecologists warn of water pollution in reservoirs and underground risks ending up on the golf course grounds. <sep><sep> However, when Prime Minister Ramgoolam wants to introduce the "best loser system," people are not happy. <sep><sep> Eliminating a system that forces him to go from being a creditor to a debtor before even entering the workforce. <sep><sep> There are paintings (Yannick Durhone, Joelle Rosalie) and sculptures showing that 'art is a great thing. <sep><sep> These are matters that the Employment Rights Act has amended. <sep><sep> However, from the value of the economic classes, the fragmentation of the federation is a serious problem. <sep><sep> In this context, we are publishing a "recent campaigns document" on the Rann Nu Diego platform (get peace 211). <sep><sep> This system has changed a lot since an amendment in 1982 that mandated dividing the population of Mauritius by community according to the 1972 Census. <sep><sep> Labor class always thinks that a law is too harsh for the world to change, or worse, "coming down on the street" when a macho unionist tells it to. <sep><sep> In 2005, a potential PMXD candidate revealed that he did not receive a ticket because he did not have Rs1,000,000 as a bribe. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What type and what form of international boycotts are necessary? <sep> This means it is an advantage for one party if it puts a strong candidate forward. <sep> In accordance with this plan, what the Trade Union Movement will do is to see what goals can be achieved in this reform, especially when there are European compensation funds coming in. <sep> The Welfare State Menace in the Budget Speech in 2011 (for the year 2012), we found that XLD began to introduce measures to address welfare state issues. <sep> We also manage to maintain reasonable international contact levels – slightly lower levels of regional contact. <sep> Another thing we have done in the elections is to establish a slightly broader platform. <sep> We have gone through a little luck and I am showing you what I have learned in the conservatory. <sep> Then there are things like "Little brother of the same kind, why go looking for strangers" like Baichoo, Dulloo, etc. we will support. <sep> And all this came together in the World Social Forum (the first of which was in 2001), which ended up acknowledging that there are 3 distinct realities: <sep> He explained that from 1973 onwards, there has been a heroic workers' struggle against the IRA. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So that we can prevent planes from taking off from our land to bomb people in other countries. <sep><sep> Some of their books are already used in the LPT course, like Henri Favory, Eshan Abdool Raman, Alain Fanchon, Lindsey Collen, Shyam Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> What kind of alliances would diplomats from other countries like? <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen has been asked to comment, and she has made a statement as a member of the LALIT Party and a member of the MLF. <sep><sep> Yet, these same countries in this "cockpit" finance and support the construction of another wall, which is twice as long, and which continues to cause many victims among the Palestinian population. <sep><sep> It was not an order that came out in a zap, from a cow. <sep><sep> But unfortunately, these articles are disconnected from the beginning on economic politics. <sep><sep> Planters were looking for water when the sun was setting over the horizon. <sep><sep> It's not like here, where at a national event, where everyone goes to the pavilion, the national arena, and French soldiers themselves are invited to fall on their heads. <sep><sep> If we expect people to swallow a bullfrog on their own, forget about it! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Will we continue to have an economy that relies on speculative, deceptive, and financial ventures? <sep><sep> But because he didn't want to waste time, many would say very little. <sep><sep> And because we analyze it together that we can find a solution to this problem because it is a serious problem. <sep><sep> Is this secrecy also a victory over what the Resistance has demanded from the United Nations Human Rights Committee, or is it a "victory" for their propaganda to deny what they are asking for here? <sep><sep> His man, like his family, but especially his family, had considered Timi as a role model. <sep><sep> Do you have a hole in your social base, in your political base, and see if there is anyone who can raise a little capital to start a soap making license. <sep><sep> Water was not charged according to consumption. <sep><sep> It is following this incident that the police have taken strong action against these 2 militants from Lalit. <sep><sep> But, to return to the death of Rajesh Ramlogun, even if there was this punishment where the State acted quickly and in a generalized way against police concern, except Raddhoa, the State quickly took the lead. <sep><sep> The Village Council's existence means that villagers can oversee their village through elected village councils. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, this sentence that is affecting disciples and canes, it will inevitably bring social conflict, when different social classes discuss how they can protect their interests. <sep><sep> Otherwise, Mr. Julienne, administrator of Britannia, can call SMF, they come right away. <sep><sep> Block 104, has awaited the Zini Nation summons for a year, it was often "imminent", but not spoken about much. <sep><sep> DALeast has sunk into Lasinn, where he majored in sculpting at the Fine Arts Institute. <sep><sep> The government can then decide its international relations, foreign policy, in a way that favors the state bourgeoisie rather than the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> This new approach to the mother tongue will bring progress that is in the interest of all children of the Republic of Mauritius and all oppressed classes. <sep><sep> Keshore Pertab reminds that Law 235 on 'Abortion' is a total prohibition. <sep><sep> Beautify the environment, teach our children to look into the Abyss of Linguistics. <sep><sep> In a moment where the government is giving the green light for the construction of a new luxury hotel, where the security industry threatens. <sep><sep> 2. Then there are effects that make Creole language mandatory in schools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The amount of drôle that resembled Dr. Martin Luther King.<sep><sep> What is striking about this second crisis, compared to the financial crisis of 2008 and the economic depression of 2007-9, today's crisis is based on the dominance of two currencies in investment and international trade, namely the Dollar and the Euro.<sep><sep> At the beginning, the UK and USA were talking nonsense, saying that there will only be "communication facilities" on Chagos.<sep><sep> During this crisis, there are also union sections that falter by making more moral discourses against individual worker misery instead of looking at it in a strategic way that goes against the working class.<sep><sep> It is a crisis that goes beyond the European continent, and affects countries such as Latin America, Brazil, and even China.<sep><sep> The economy The economy issue has really dominated, in terms of engine-shaped drivers. <sep><sep> In English, this is called "mother-tongue based multilingualism". This brings literacy to a new level. <sep><sep> This means that enough innocent people who are imprisoned for minor crimes, or worse, by mistake, to compensate for the release of criminal prisoners in inconclusive trials. <sep><sep> This leads to the decriminalization of work, a demand that leads to more class equality as well.<sep><sep> We have found our connection with the 4th International, where we received Leon Cremieux to speak at our International Congress in 2009. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here is the transcription of Ragini Kistnasamy's speech at the Strategy Conference on March 12, 2012, in the Mama Bul Later Hall, Grand River. <sep><sep> Those who remained in the PT recruitments that came from the MSM, such as Bappoo and Choonee, are relatively quiet, politically. <sep><sep> Then, when Aneerood Jugnauth and Berenger come to power, that's the same moment where Cehl Meeah is forced to resign. <sep><sep> B, who seemed to be an MSM proposition, proposed proportional nomination among candidates who were not elected. <sep><sep> The Women's Liberation Movement held a meeting on Saturday 31 Ziyet to prepare for the launch of an anti-criminalist campaign. <sep><sep> Didier Robert, head of St Felix, is ensuring peace in November, December, January and bonuses for St. artisans. <sep><sep> It is a manifesto that specifically avoids the capitalist system like the source of inequality and poverty. <sep><sep> When the government is offering loans to SMEs, paying half the salary for employees, giving Rs20,000 per month for a year to new entrepreneurs, all this encouragement is intended to create employment. <sep><sep> Sometimes, there is a "common denominator", meaning that many let themselves be influenced by a consumer society. <sep><sep> All these small units must be regrouped together, and the government must provide them with all the facilities they need to improve their production. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After the end, Olivier Bancoult started to compare himself with Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, and gave a speech calling for peace. <sep> <sep> Later, while Aziza was getting dressed, she made a small signal for Aziz to follow her to his office. <sep> <sep> This year, we have prepared 3-4 programs on different topics: Languages (second reprint), Workers' Demand Class and Freedom. <sep> <sep> Life under Israeli military occupation is becoming more and more difficult day by day. <sep> <sep> And they have chosen this date, Tuesday 7th October. <sep> <sep> After the elections, in the government of the Alliance Social, Minister Sithanen thought that he alone could orchestrate a massive downturn that would impoverish the population. <sep> <sep> His long black servant descended straight on his back. <sep> <sep> He is trying to do a collective work in an environment that favours total individuality. <sep> <sep> He seems always half-right, always common, his argumentation sits on "democratization of the economy" a-la-PT, and he seems to have political ambitions. <sep> <sep> They have left, no one really knows why they have left. <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> We request for a bilateral discussion as since 1968 there has never been a bilateral discussion. 

Engels showed how Morgan's law proves that there was no state in the old society. 

They cannot help the boss because they live in villages/ neighborhoods. 

Then finally last week Rama Valayden released a document proposing reform. 

We recently found out how the police used repression against Jane Ragoo and Reaz Chuttoo. 

But, one will have a way out for humanity, and one won't.

At the gathering they regrouped people who work with street children and in prisons, as well as volunteers in other associations.

Some have ensured that establishment bosses who support this conversion from the sugar industry to the energy industry, a disastrous process for the working class in Mauritius.

In his name, he knew that it was tough for him, but it wasn't just for him, but for the others who needed help to navigate through the cyclone.

Minister Jeetah even gave importers the green light when they threatened to stop importing due to a "fixed mark-up". <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bizlall takes the bus to Rose-Hill, Sooklall takes the bus to Quatre Bornes. <sep><sep> Many people finally realized that the petition was inappropriate. <sep><sep> As a result, all the people together, including employers, provide all "communities" with a feeling of belonging. <sep><sep> Notice that at the same time as we "hide" with nature (so nature seems beyond us), we are an integral part of nature. <sep><sep> Furthermore, we have obtained rewards (land lords, nobles, their "disconnected" supposedly better) who were reigning, meaning there was a "State" based mainly on controlling certain family units on Earth, not mainly on religious beliefs. <sep><sep> National College for 1260 very good CPE students, Regional College for the rest, and the Prefect for those who can't pass. <sep><sep> All this is to be done where capital is accumulating. <sep><sep> Thus, this vanguard (often accused of being drunk), at the same time among workers, at the same time in times of increased mobilization, becomes separated from workers, it becomes leadership. <sep><sep> And further, it becomes more difficult because today many people work in contracts, informally, small businesses. <sep><sep> Hence the MSM-MMM government is responsible for increasing the number of people who cannot read or write. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He urges us to ask questions that place us in a position outside the comfort zone to free women and humanity. <sep> <sep> PMSD against, MMM against and PT and MSM in favor. <sep> <sep> This started in 1979, and continues to this day, every year, once or twice, we've never missed. <sep> <sep> In June 2005, the MMM/MSM/PMSD alliance lost the elections and elected 22 deputies, plus 2 co-opted deputies. <sep> <sep> Workers if they don't understand much about politics (and they will say so too), they say, "Well, I see the bosses and the top managers, all those columns, they're all saying. <sep> <sep> When the government today says it intends to replace the IRA, it can appear positive, but it's just an appearance. <sep> <sep> Regarding Berenger, Lindsay Collen said that Lalit noted that the DPP had embarrassed Berenger's political line on Cehl Meeah. <sep> <sep> iv Financial crisis: Affects IRS, tourism, offshore. <sep> <sep> it's not alien to him to find this ominous, but rather in a scientific way. <sep> <sep> So you get better, less than 50%. IRS continues to rise, but the dance has slowed down. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was always critical of Tamby, whom he believed was living in sin. <sep><sep> Today, on the website, we are pleased to give an overview of what Alain Ah-Vee said: <sep><sep> Those in power are not just uninterested, but their only interest is making a profit. <sep><sep> With the union movement by your side, it is reasonable to challenge this bill head-on. <sep><sep> Lindsey told me that we were on a family outing. <sep><sep> Last Wednesday, on 3rd October, LALIT member Ram Seegobin made a presentation to the LALIT Trade Union Commission, which was followed by a debate among present members from various unions in different work sectors. <sep><sep> It was called "Education: What Future?" At that time, we were advocating for a legal framework to compel all plantations to integrate its sugarcane fields in a way that facilitates sustainable intercropping throughout its land. <sep><sep> Now, we need to continue exerting political pressure so that the mother tongue becomes a medium for teaching Mathematics, Science, Geography, etc. <sep><sep> Often, they redirect this toward organizing seminars, conferences, and the first May Day events. <sep><sep> Sometimes, you can change the price if, for example, you organize within a union with the collective strength of workers. Together, they can say to the employer, "We're not selling out our courage for this price." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he was suffering a physical anguish so intense that it threatened to bring an unwanted child into the world. <sep><sep> He explained to us what had happened to him: he's a farmer. <sep><sep> The systemic crisis in Mauritius, the oil crisis, the energy crisis, the food crisis, the financial crisis, the economic crisis, the ecological crisis, everyone has been caught in a frenzied pace in the last 5 years. <sep><sep> There is another thing that determines the working conditions which is collective greed. <sep><sep> So, it's individual and unconscious and they might even want to tell people who are leading them. <sep><sep> This means that they usually invite you to a radio program about things like what Pravind Jugnauth said yesterday, but you can always talk about it, always criticize the system. <sep><sep> In the mirror on one side there is a leaf with a photo of people who died in the 2nd Intifada resistance to the Occupation, there were 3,500 Palestinians who died. <sep><sep> "There is no alternative" by Margaret Thatcher (TINA) in the 1980s, when she ruled the UK, has sunk in. <sep><sep> It is clear to LALIT that we need a reorientation in the economy, we need to move towards an economy that is at least partially independent of energy and at the same time invest in renewable and sustainable energy, increase the military base, stop the production of nuclear weapons and the arms industry. <sep><sep> In short, the same instances that elected them can also shoot them; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT's last bulletin, we described the state of Jugnauth as a Bonapartist state. <sep><sep> In the same vein, most other trade union, political, social, cultural organization and schools each issue their correspondence to communicate with their members. <sep><sep> As a first "gig", Sir Aneerood Jugnauth organized a dinner for former President Chissano of Mozambique, and there was present Navin Ramgoolam, Xavier Duval, and Pravind Jugnauth. <sep><sep> We also organized a public lecture in Creole, and held study groups in Creole and on the Creole language. <sep><sep> Families in the village of Hares have to face notices to demolish their homes. <sep><sep> So, courage, has become a form of capital, a commodity to be used. <sep><sep> Therefore, the Trade Union Movement is entering into large mobilizations, on the basis of separate, isolated, seemingly meaningless issues, revealing themselves since a generalized crisis. <sep><sep> Then, when everyone comes together, shall we just perhaps trip over things? <sep><sep> The people do not want to be held responsible for the Chagos people's hardships, nor for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <sep><sep> And we must understand that it is a "Bankruptcy!" if you win in a "voir dire". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is interesting is that all these countries are still here today. 25 years ago there were studies and discussions on issues that are exactly blocking agricultural diversification and food production, and today in 2005 we are still in that same situation. <sep><sep> We should also consider how people who already own or rent houses can be interested in participating in government housing programs. <sep><sep> We cannot say today that we have a national education system as such. <sep><sep> While there are great problems at their level. <sep><sep> It is the colonial administration that imposed this on the bourgeoisie, it made a concession and finally it is the colonial State that imposed this on the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Today, a survey by L'Express says that 42% of people consider education a priority for them. <sep><sep> He said rather when we talk about Partial Discharging in Item Agenda number 3, we can truly see the truth of the launch. <sep><sep> This social crisis cannot be seen separately from the economic crisis. <sep><sep> In reality, with the electronic revolution, the majority of workers have been reduced to precarious work - on the contrary, it is often less time-consuming. <sep><sep> on the pretext of a noose, when they were saved from facing a herd of 10,000 hostile, determined, on their tiptoes, on cliffs with pitchforks, barricaded everywhere, every 5 meters. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On one side, with the declaration and revocation of Madam Dulloo, on the other side. <sep> On the demand for workers' class, on culture, on rights for all people in Mauritius to participate in politics (civil service, all kinds of work). <sep> So, we have found, and are finding, a large increase in CSR recently. <sep> This was in a political education session by LALIT in September. <sep> The Supreme Court cannot determine the "community" of candidates, if there is a dispute, says Ziz Seetulsing. <sep> They are helping immensely to start their analysis, to give quality advice on things that could help the union movement. <sep> When people mobilized in 2006 and 2007 over the redundancy of 60 DWC staff, or for a change in the subsidy scale for medical exams, this risked a dead end. <sep> Families who were ready, also participated in this kind of cooperative: buying and selling the oil they produce. <sep> We were preparing politically, we were preparing for two union victories. <sep> They have a weak reflection on the working class, and are still aiding in the weakening of the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Develop LALIT its documentation center so that all members have access to information and analysis. <sep> Involving lawyers, auditors, a notary, and an accountant up to now. <sep> an organization and strategy and tactics on how to make life at work better, as a first step in family life, it unfolds at work. <sep> And an extraordinary thing in this country, often enough, is that "From now on, it is military law that prevails." <sep> But, if the value of the Dollar falls, Lasin will get less money in its repayments from the Chinese State. <sep> It is only LALIT that has survived, and remains dynamic. <sep> Occasionally think that this price provides a special value for this literary and written work. <sep> The way LALIT has survived and remains active is also long. <sep> Today, as the establishment begins its turn from the defense industry to the energy industry (including energy production, ethanol, etc.). <sep> The food crisis is a yellow light that is difficult to handle well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Presidency and Prime Ministership are undergoing fundamental transformation. <sep> When in fact the Palestinian people know neither peace nor their process. <sep> Meanwhile, the United Nations agencies, such as FAO, lack money due to the economic crisis in the USA and Europe. <sep> We don't know who will succeed, to make a Social Alliance, an alliance with MSM, with MMM, with PMSD. <sep> Another additional difficulty is to organize meetings, today it is a challenge to freely assemble. <sep> But a woman cannot divorce without her husband's permission, or she must go to court. <sep> They want to see a way to exploit this marine reserve. <sep> People who cultivate this value every day through their work, lose control at work. <sep> And Sachs issues his Report, where he criticizes the best loser system, without truly saying that it should be changed. <sep> But, before we delve further into 2011, perhaps it is worth looking back at a few elements in the background, things that have contributed to this exceptional year. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it is a political party that represents this strict fluid, dynamic structure, which allows its members to work together towards a common goal. <sep> <sep> On the Chagos issue, it is the working class of Mauritius that will have to come forward courageously in this struggle against the military presence of the British government on our territory. <sep> <sep> We had a statement to support the new law. <sep> <sep> 22nd August 2011 - Mr. Hanoomajee arrested by ICAC. <sep> <sep> Year after year, he has been looking for excuses to avoid participating in the electoral campaign. <sep> <sep> The fact that many teachers, through their unions, have already taken a stance in favor of the introduction of Creole language as a teaching medium in the education system. <sep> <sep> They were upset that the Government only gave them Rs 135 to face the inflation that has entered their homes, destroying their ration. <sep> <sep> Here, a harsh reality, a reality of class behind this instability. <sep> <sep> Work is a social matter, but this appropriation that is private, because our system is based on private property, the product becomes outside of it. <sep> <sep> It is quite strange that Pravind Jugnauth has been receiving large amounts of money for his family since the government, when he was in government with Berenger, on the construction of Sun Trust, and now, he gets a second large sum for his family since the government, when he is in government with Ramgoolam. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to history, it is the first time in at least 100 years that Americans are voting against war. <sep><sep> It is not even the position to "abolish the best loser system!" <sep><sep> However, only LALIT has a political vision on this issue. <sep><sep> He asks Manann, his young son, to open the door. <sep><sep> All options on decisions we need to make have been thoroughly debated. <sep><sep> So, this current trend in Latin America is also occurring in Asia. <sep><sep> How is it possible to have this link between political struggle and trade union struggle. <sep><sep> We pay tribute to the peasant activist Lee Kyung Hae, who committed suicide in protest against WTO policies. <sep><sep> The Ganges River is said to have sold Jamaona's suffering, but there is Jamaona everywhere. <sep><sep> The Social Alliance government has abolished the tripartite system, replacing it with the NPC. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Parliament has been given a call, the rules have changed, when a woman loses her husband, now, in the sea, you no longer have to wait 10 years for her to benefit from a pension. <sep><sep> In this meeting, Ragini Kistnasamy and Rajni Lallah, MLF delegates, explained to Minister Seebun why it is necessary to establish a Rape Crisis Unit. <sep><sep> and the research of Prof.Tove Skutnabb Kangas on linguistic diversity as a scientific argument to support the use of maternal languages. <sep><sep> - Wow! That was really good! - Oh my goodness! I feel the same way. <sep><sep> As for the First of May Movement, Jack Bizlall began the year in March by announcing that he is launching the "auto-efas" First of May Movement. <sep><sep> The idea had taken on an advanced stage, he was looking for a new ship. <sep><sep> Now, the British Government and its BIOT have declared a Marine Protected Area with the aim of protecting Mother Earth, illegally, and having a nuclear military base inside, it is a disgrace. <sep><sep> At Checkpoint, there is a long checkpoint to reach Nablus and a long checkpoint to enter Salfit. <sep><sep> Very soon, a passionate and deep love developed between them and when they decided to get married, they found that a quantity of conflict, tension, and violence were sleeping beneath the surface. <sep><sep> But, a program on education, while good, is not enough. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the frequent development of a "personal" dimension in these relationships, naturally, in a larger place like Mauritius. <sep><sep> Each student of Form 6 must earn their place for overseas universities and the University of Mauritius, meaning each student of Form 6 must obtain 2 or 3 distinctions. <sep><sep> Those who have withered away, who have become more dictatorial, who have curtailed freedom, true love in old-fashioned cages, they are even crying out for the need to preserve family, ancestral values. <sep><sep> There is no notion of defense even though there is a possibility to defend a "murder." <sep><sep> In this matter, it is a move to weaken Pravind Jugnauth's leadership and to give the MMM a key role. <sep><sep> We would have risked going against ourselves as a political force if we had gone ahead with this strategy. <sep><sep> We have deliberately taken a step back from this current trade union movement controlled by bureaucrats who are opportunistic, lacking principles. <sep><sep> A website has also been developed with a new design, a new section for "programs and manifesto," with audio, photos, literature, and developed posters. <sep><sep> We can see the education system in its historical context, as we have indeed inherited a colonial education system. <sep><sep> But we do not see any other way to undermine the "Star" colleges other than this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, you all admit that the economic situation is very serious. <sep> <sep> If there is a Deputy or Minister who wants to represent American security interests, he must resign in Parliament here and put forward his candidacy in America. <sep> <sep> You can create a perception of "Mauritianism", "national unity", "social consensus", but these perceptions may not reflect reality. <sep> <sep> In its second facility, the Labour Party is a party whose ideology has the capacity to change; its ideology is not rigid. <sep> <sep> This does not mean that the English language is superior to the French language, French is superior to Mauritian Creole or Mauritian Creole is superior to other languages that have not yet been developed in written form. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen, who was co-president at the launch of the Movement for the Liberation of Women, explained how the Movement for the Liberation of Women had already taken a stand against the Camp David accords in 1980, and had published a publication in which there was an MLF article. <sep> <sep> In the city, she was elected all her deputies in Curepipe, Beau-Bassin-Rose-Hill, got some deputies in Port Louis and got a deputy in Vacoas. <sep> <sep> The MSM/MMM have introduced, for the first time in the Constitution, the concept of a "diverse nation", a Republic that gathers diverse tribes. <sep> <sep> During this last year, we have also found N. Ramgoolam in a position where he is trying to regain the accounts that exist in the country. <sep> <sep> To conclude, and here we admit that we cannot do otherwise except discuss on this question, when he invites Ram. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When working class conscious themselves social classes become a reality that explains the problems they face in society while working. <sep><sep> Victims, their families, their friends, their neighbors, people in their surroundings, they suffer. <sep><sep> Yesterday, it happened like this, if we analyze it closely. <sep><sep> It is precisely this support that has shed light on the can and say "better" investment for Mauritius. <sep><sep> After having distributed the morning, at 6 am on the field we can also use the same later as a necessity for a later site, that is, every branch regularly goes to a site in its ownership. <sep><sep> "Little scrap of paper" is an encouragement to children, to the innocents, and little ones also, mention a certain fragility or vulnerability. <sep><sep> Other parties sometimes support the demand for "more female police recruitment". <sep><sep> When Lindsay Collen member of Lalit personally told Le Mauricien that even he does not concern him at all, he was better off not printing quickly, besides, they did not publish any rectification. <sep><sep> The United Kingdom and the USA, their plan is to make either the entire Chagos, or Diego Garcia like a "Mayotte", that is a future target, with a status still to be defined. <sep><sep> We, members of LALIT, were active in an organization called "Union of all workers and artisans" that ended up having 3 slideshow sessions on the theme "Future islands", in Suriname, L'Escalier and Bambous, and it was a great success. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This social division makes it possible for one to use and abuse another person's memory - one need not even perform that work himself; <sep><sep> Initially, it was formed within a doubtful-dynamic: anti-Berenger, and anti-Sovietic. <sep><sep> There is an international movement going on now against military bases. <sep><sep> Thus, it is a class conscience that does not take you far. <sep><sep> Thus, it runs the risk of prolonging the suffering of oppressed people by keeping them in a subordinate position where they expect to receive charity. <sep><sep> And it symbolizes the criminal blockade that the Palestinians in Gaza suffer daily. <sep><sep> But if you have a strategy based on "Mauritianism", where you end up including the manager of MCB and the boss of La Sentinel in your block. <sep><sep> The US Embassy has been very active, with, infiltration of the CIA into Facebook and Twitter networks now well known. <sep><sep> Everyone will get the same seat whether they study at Baichoo Madhoo School, Cantorel School, Bramstan School, or Rivalland School. <sep><sep> And at the same time, what about the process of replacing the IRA-Labour Act that is going to give more power to employers and the State to crush workers? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The issue of what to do with the European money that has been raised is a crucial one for our campaign. <sep><sep> Now, worker Anna has been found, has been discussed, has been measured, has been planned, has been decided: They say they are going to work collectively from now on too. <sep><sep> He has told me that I must write "I must address my Miss in French" 200 times. The next day, when he prevented me from going to the toilet, I suffered a terrible trauma, I fainted in my veins. <sep><sep> And obviously, Jugnauth has a plan, he has his people that he will favor. <sep><sep> He defended the security bourgeoisie against the anti-monopoly law in 1988 under the A.Jugnauth regime. <sep><sep> An employer says to you "I'm also in the 'lepep'." <sep><sep> and has been replaced by another man who seems more open to diversification. <sep><sep> And without any trouble he announces that there are 45% of workers who must work in total insecurity in a small business. <sep><sep> It is surreal that in all this violence at this moment. <sep><sep> * 7:45 pm - At the beginning of the village of Beita, a man and a woman enter the Service. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have faced a crisis at school, which means the planet in me in 9 different ways, with a series of natural disasters, earthquakes, tsunamis, not to mention the nuclear accident that occurred in Japan. <sep> In the neighborhoods you visited, there are 500,000 people living. <sep> We need to know this, and we need to keep an eye on it so that we can understand the trajectory, so that we can understand nature, so that we can understand action, in these two parts, Workers and MMM. <sep> And Berenger and Navin Ramgoolam agree to waive obligations (I will put emphasis on this 'obligation') to declare community nominations on the Nomination Paper. <sep> team coordination artists, exhibition preparation team, media contact team, organize coffee-dite team, catering coordination team, message team from another country. <sep> Lalit is starting the election for an alternative economy that is in the interest of all people who need to work to live. <sep> Facing a very serious economic crisis, the Social Alliance and Workers have taken care of all the burden for the past 5 years. <sep> He explains why Subron goes as far as to spread the idea that the union is supporting his project to make a profitable cannabis industry. <sep> For us in LALIT, our internationalist policy has been focused on this role that the working class has to change the capitalist economic system that is dominating here and globally. <sep> If so, it must be said in our language, Creole, or Bhojpuri, but clearly we, we have an advantage. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I will make a small digression to say that in Mauritius, we have already found a certain number of ways in which the state functions somewhat like a "guarantee" for these private property stocks. <sep><sep> When we analyze the education system in place in the Republic of Mauritius, that is to say in Mauritius, Rodrigues, Agalega, it is clear that it is doing its utmost for the education of all children. <sep><sep> Companies from Korea, France, USA, India, Spain, South Africa. <sep><sep> This year it was not possible to make a "time-table" forecast, the Assembly has concluded, because we need to act dialectically, that is to say, it depends largely on what is going to happen for us to decide on the timing. <sep><sep> Worth noting, for the first time, a third party, MMSD has managed to be elected. <sep><sep> We are continuing our activities in international organizations against military bases. <sep><sep> But 2 years later, there was a military coup where Bhutto was replaced by Zia UL Haq, a general in the army. <sep><sep> There needs to be a political action at the same time that captures the power of each enterprise. <sep><sep> In his first budget, Pravin Jugnauth began to apply this reactionary ideology. <sep><sep> Since 1965, sometimes to guarantee clothes, sometimes to guarantees frozen fish, or American clothes, different Mauritian regimes have traded and compromised the territorial integrity of Mauritius with American imperialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So far, the trade union movement has not diversified agricultural with good results. <sep> <sep> Class consciousness and class struggle do matter a little. <sep> <sep> A slight smile crossed the guard's face in grateful acknowledgment, reminiscent of what happened in a past not too far away on the level of righteousness Martin Luther King would have faced a crisis that could have killed him. <sep> <sep> And also to go to the salt-producing country. <sep> <sep> What is important to note is the policy bankruptcy of all political parties in Parliament. <sep> <sep> You may believe, if you read it, that there are only two blocs. <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee gave an overview of LALIT's actions of the recent Assembly. <sep> <sep> Dear: What Comrade George has said is also in agreement with what Comrade Yves said earlier. <sep> <sep> In the Armed Forces always forgiveness, but the Islamists are calling for a rally from today. And, during repression, my religious organization is repressed like the political organization of the time. <sep> <sep> (3) The margin ensures for textiles and sugar, through political arrangements, created by political parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In addition to attending the Congress, Lindsey Collen for LALIT, and Ariane Zely for KPRM-PRD, were also invited as speakers in a public forum, Saturday 6th June. <sep><sep> Jabaljas invited everyone for a grand feast before a long period of sacrifice. <sep><sep> LALIT has provided detailed information on the demonstrations in the recent days against the criminal attacks that the Zini government has been carrying out in the city of Fallujah in Iraq. <sep><sep> It will be a true waste to serve or simply choose between them. <sep><sep> We need to discuss this in the upcoming days. <sep><sep> * Overtime applies after 90 hours of work per week, and work 2 Sundays per month without pay overtime. <sep><sep> According to LALIT, we are suffering the consequences of this criminal deal made in 1993 where on one side there was a 50% reservation of seats in Catholic schools and on the other side the accounting of oriental languages. <sep><sep> For politicians, it will depend more on their own organizational capacity, not only the quantity but also a program that can bring maximum agreement among the people. <sep><sep> Newspaper articles and radio programs they use to keep in touch with the masses. <sep><sep> On this, he agreed with Dr. Martin Luther King. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These individuals, they were militants in MMM, militants in MMMSP, militants who believed in the class struggle. <sep><sep> Therefore, this is not just a matter of "political science" to understand all these power mechanisms, which Machiavelli has also described so accurately in his book 'The Prince'. <sep><sep> He, he sets them off balance, signals them, they follow us all the way into people's homes. <sep><sep> and began to create space for the birth of what is called "state bourgeoisie" (this also in all communities). <sep><sep> He is just looking for a point where he can provoke a slightly hysterical reaction from a public traumatized by a serious social crisis that the capitalist system is actually creating. <sep><sep> This kind of slogan embodies 'Morisyanism' and authentic 'Mauritian-ness', when it is a political strategy to rally people, has been present in different periods of Mauritius's history, already. <sep><sep> They are all the ones who will have the machinery to carry out campaigns in municipal elections, on a superficies as large as a district. <sep><sep> I ask myself, with all the reflection taking place, are we not talking about the same thing. <sep><sep> in our tracks of 12,000 copies in print, 5 times in the last year, in our frequent meetings and film screenings in certain neighborhoods, in our public forums in 8 districts, in our leaflets, on our website, in our bilingual theoretical book. <sep><sep> On the second day, his madness, a Saturday, was not futile. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said he wants to prevent a takeover by a French establishment and company on the energy supplier. <sep><sep> facilites money transfer from the NPF fund to finance private health insurance, and also announce State investments from companies where he is a shareholder. <sep><sep> We need to mobilize together, understanding the real relationships behind the facade of the "economy", and changing it. <sep><sep> While the Ka hold up Bank of Grand Bois was taking place, lawyer Hurnam got a suspension from the Supreme Court for contempt against the magistrates and DPP. <sep><sep> This means that we have somewhat returned to how we were, about 250-300 bananas down where those were the supportive companies. <sep><sep> And this lack of discussion in Lalit despite the payment for federation work, there are political implications that deserve discussion. <sep><sep> But he doesn't have the strength to do so, and the employers will just say "No!". <sep><sep> Labour Minister Shakeel Mohammed presented amendments to ERiA and EreA in Parliament in December 2012, and three different sections of the trade union movement opposed these amendments separately. <sep><sep> My intervention is partly related to the problems that exist regarding the Chagos, among others. <sep><sep> and he introduced a law to make privatization of all kinds of services easier for employers (PPP Public Private Partnership). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the same time, unmarried, after a love affair when she was young, and childless, Paule Ninan became a mother, then a grandmother, for four generations of children. <sep>

<sep> Now, on 27 February, The New York Times announced that the USA is proposing to "share" information from space with the Lalzerian Government, providing rights to serve its territory without interruption. <sep>
<sep> I remember when the Indian Ocean Islands Games were held in Mauritius, all the media reported an extraordinary phenomenon as if a great national unity existed and was very much alive. <sep>
<sep> Revolution does not mean violence and disorder, as some people say. <sep>
<sep> In LALIT, for several years, it has been our permanent work to develop our program. <sep>
<sep> Apart from the IRS, it is proposing SME, small and medium-sized enterprises. <sep>

" The base has a pretext, why do they say luck must be needed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They posed a special emergency that could expand if good decisions were made but could be blocked if forced. <sep><sep> Israel is blaming Lasiri for the recent suicide attack in Be'er Sheva where 15 people died. <sep><sep> Ecuador Front against the Base and Wilbert from an Institute in Laoland. <sep><sep> He maintains a programmatic, theoretical, practical political continuity that has been in place for a while; he maintains continuity in a given moment where political awareness can be very low. <sep><sep> It is also important to note that the Alliance for the Future is the result of unacceptable interference by President Jugnauth in partisan politics, as Soodhun himself has confirmed. <sep><sep> There is a very simple reason for this: no language in the world can say in front of its linguistic colleagues that it is advisable to use languages that are not mother tongues as a medium in schools. <sep><sep> In addition to the coastline that serves as a coast guard, this required coastline represents a buffer zone of 50-75 meters on each side of the beach where all illegal constructions are found. <sep><sep> The government says our rights in Mauritius have disappeared, but when you look closely, it is the rights of the workers that are disappearing. <sep><sep> Some importers are causing havoc in their supplies, for example, leftovers in Australia. <sep><sep> and other conditions that the establishment's patrons consider "new" and with which he does not agree. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The system is facing a surplus, and the classroom layout is a way to share this surplus between the 2 main protagonists. <sep><sep> So, first of all, CMFI has laid off 200 workers in production. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, MMM is stuck in stagnation, which its Congress doesn't seem to have overcome. <sep><sep> L’Estrac and Bizlall seemed to be trying to carry out a humorous "take-over" recently, during a certain period in the last Government. <sep><sep> So, the civilian population is dying, getting wounded, traumatized, with bombs being dropped from airplanes originating from our soil, from aircraft carriers burning in our seas, in a part of our country: Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> MMM has apparently taken on a vocation to represent the 'minorities', and this has been true since 1981. <sep><sep> During discussions on the film afterward, together we really began to "find" the greatness of the film, understanding its new contribution to the development of "cinema". <sep><sep>c. They ask for an immigration quota in the USA and UK <sep><sep> But what's your real name? - Gopia, Votmazeste! - Gopia. <sep><sep> However, this is not our agenda, we're only applying measures step by step. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you want to have a better understanding, you know what you need to do? <sep><sep> It is we ourselves who climb buildings, cement, golf course. <sep><sep> They feel threatened, in the event that Creole becomes a medium, because French may become optional, it. <sep><sep> The document also analyzes the Media conflict v/s the State and the LALIT media strategy. <sep><sep> Like introducing the Creole language in schools, it involves only talking with people, like Dev sipa Legallant, who says he was persuaded, and then, ep! <sep><sep> In work, for example, we find this patriarchal inconsistency. <sep><sep> - Small and medium businessman (Jugnauth's Happy Shop until then). <sep><sep> This MSM-MMM Government, it has set up its Collendavelloo Committee. <sep><sep> Clearly L'Estrac is relying on other movements here, like the migration within the bourgeoisie in the Morisyan diaspora in Australia that in the "tour operators" business in Sydney. <sep><sep> There must be an energetic policy that liberates the entire agricultural land for food production. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, what's important is that we need to prioritize providing education in a holistic manner. <sep><sep> Whereas, when the class struggle is well understood, then the bureaucracy is greatly diminished. <sep><sep> And finally, it is the public sector workers who are the most protected and given more voice and freedom. <sep><sep> LALIT has its work cut out for them to mobilize and unify the working class behind a political program that will lead to socialism. <sep><sep> And it has about twelve steps with which it shares common values. <sep><sep> - Pedagogical book that has experienced in using the Mauritian Creole language in education at different levels: P.Lallah (Playgroup preschool level, primary, teacher-parent); J.Harmon, Gilberte Chung (BEC - pre-vocational level, teacher), Arnaud Carpooran (University: student trainer in dictionary preparation). <sep><sep> When the state settled the question of sovereignty with the military base issue, what happened: it ended up by accepting the presence of military bases and acknowledging British sovereignty in practice. <sep><sep> What is necessary is, while maintaining popular pressure to close the Zini State military base, at the same time, to maintain pressure for the right of return for all Chagossians and full reparations. <sep><sep> This will be part of the several meetings that LALIT is holding in the context of their campaign for an Alternative Economic Policy. <sep><sep> There are also several sections of the working class and trade union movement that are clearly pro-regime, visibly deepening divisions within the trade union movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is back on Sun Trust, new report that the President of the Republic is the official leader. <sep><sep> There have also been many debates on electoral reform and the future of the best loser system. <sep><sep> Immediately provide support for agricultural production and livestock farming, which is in Mauritius on Rodrigues before anyone starts suffering from food shortages, before knowledge of plantations and livestock starts to disappear. <sep><sep> Secondly, 200 to 250 years ago, there was an Industrial Revolution, where the industrial capitalist system emerged, the bourgeoisie emerged, and the working class (what is called "slave piece") also emerged. <sep><sep> What is important is to establish the fact that when using the mother tongue, then we are recognizing ALL INDIVIDUALS in society. <sep><sep> Contact LALIT if you want to organize a meeting directly or on the work site. <sep><sep> Workers of the past who produced capital that exists today. <sep><sep> They are getting involved in the new Historical Bloc. <sep><sep> This is a contradiction between the union movement, their trade union commission, and it is discussing this. <sep><sep> But, with IRA, a JNP is a union reorganization that defends the same category of workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <src> The weather is affecting and will affect 100% due to this systemic crisis. <sep><sep> We need to go and check the employee, take details, write the article, compare the reality of each employee with the provisions of the new Employment Rights Act. <sep><sep> Then the person says they received another invitation to the Andra Day event, and then, even then, they changed their "yes" to "no". <sep><sep> In England, are there any 'Anglicists' fighting racist groups like the BNP? <sep><sep> And who was the Prime Minister at the time of this fraud? <sep><sep> He looks like he relies on what the employer will cut off from his worker. <sep><sep> Three years later, when he received a 'first class' automatically his university gave him a scholarship to do his PhD. <sep><sep> In the villages, in people's minds in general, there was a sense of wonder. <sep><sep> This kind of policy that represses 98% of Mauritian people's mother tongue, it is being done in a conscious way. <sep><sep> In detail, 14 people present were sure to understand how Gokhool is proposing to make an entrance in 2007, and how the BEC school already made their entrance in 2005 and 2006 in their Form I to VI classes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the privatization of Telecom, employees there have been subjected to all kinds of attacks on their freedom of expression and association. <sep><sep> This means their mother tongue, which, as a result, becomes more efficient as a means of representing the whole world next to it. <sep><sep> There has been a struggle for Independence, and ultimately it is colonial power that imposes Independence and gives Independence against bourgeois interests. <sep><sep> In conclusion, we believe that the amendments we are proposing to give mother tongue the importance which the masses use as their first language deserve all the dignity. <sep><sep> Maybe they haven't thought about its content well, but they are acting as if there is an alternative. <sep><sep> The struggle has just launched its program for an Alternative Economic Policy on which our campaign is particularly based. <sep><sep> They have discussed the development of the Creole language, different orthographies, and also the importance of publication and publicity. <sep><sep> It is true that in movements that were fighting Pwento Kav there was a bit of a gap where Medine Establishment was far behind, not just La Chaumiere, but also. <sep> <sep> Workers no longer believe that the solution is to put their heads together. <sep><sep> If today there is a rise in communalism, a great responsibility rests on the shoulders of Paul Berenger himself. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> the most important thing is that he and his family were living well. <sep> it is not much different from the Anglophone media empire Murdoch or from Fox News in America. <sep> there's Mrs. Vev. Bindoo Ramlogun, LALIT member Jerry Cadine, student Sebastien Orange, artist Nitin Chinien, merchant Bayim Ajaree. <sep> while poisoning by toxic substances or deadly bacteria is almost instantaneous. <sep> Present at the first major Family Solidarity meeting in 1978, an orator in the video film made by MLF calling for the decriminalization of abortion in the 1980s, she was a member of the Family Liberation Movement committee for 20 years. <sep> and not to forget all the banners, posters, leaflets, banners, and tracks used in mobilization, in petitions, in strikes, in union and political demonstrations. <sep> We must denounce the hypocrisy of the Zionist state for its use of terrorism, persecution by Israel, and its tolerance of intolerance and arrogance. <sep> Everything she would have touched would have turned to ash. <sep> Ganga had her daughter in shame but for Sir Ralph, this was the beginning of her true love story. <sep> The Road Map is nurturing agriculture and energy production in sugar plantations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Disabled Workers Movement of Lesid, which regroups more than 200 former disabled workers from Mahebourg and several dozen former disabled workers from other regions in the south and South-East. <sep><sep> We are discussing his lack of ideology. <sep><sep> It is a bourgeois current, which opposes historical bourgeois, which also opposes ultra-liberal bourgeois. <sep><sep> In the Labor Day meeting, the Social Alliance announced 10 measures it will take if it comes to power: such as free dictionary distribution and school children. <sep><sep> It is these kinds of relationships that we, at Lalit, never want to have with any union or federation or union or trade union movement. <sep><sep> Knowledge of what is happening in Mauritius, worldwide, in the history of philosophy, the history of ideas. <sep><sep> When MSM-MMM came to power in 2000, Minister Gayan had indicated that the kind of politics without principles Moris should adopt. <sep><sep> All categories of hotels had difficulty: they had to reduce their rates, your occupancy rate has decreased because many new hotels have been built (chances to accommodate the 2 million tourists that Xavier Duval was waiting for!). <sep><sep> They said if they couldn't work more, take the VRS and leave. <sep><sep> Ramba looked like her grandmother and sometimes she would misbehave. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that they are enforcing a law that, if you are bald, you cannot plant anything else, there must be a law to prevent you. <sep><sep> Because he didn't know it, it didn't exist. <sep><sep> LALIT has issued a Statement against the Local Government Bill supposed to be voted in the National Assembly on Tuesday, 8th September. <sep><sep> We need to prepare ourselves for a great punishment and when they come they come quickly. <sep><sep> For a long time, LALIT has been vigilant against the dangers that capitalist globalization, AGOA, and WTO represent to the people in Mauritius and particularly in the world. <sep><sep> But basically, and the way it has been shown in an era of general elections, it is after all its function to preside over all the reflections of interest in a bourgeois society. <sep><sep> It is like a snake's game. If it were to go past certain steps, it would be very likely to return to its starting point when the tail of another snake bites it and sends it all the way back to zero. <sep><sep> We never say that, nor do we desire it. <sep><sep> The question-and-answer session was very interesting and lasted 20 minutes. <sep><sep> what contributes to environmental preservation, and what responsibilities for social cohesion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As you may already know, it is precisely these street demonstrations that have triggered sanctions in court history. <sep><sep> Agriculture and peace should be based on what the elderly already know together with scientific research, and research in Cuba and China on the production of food for a large number of people that will serve them. <sep><sep> For all of us together, we should take the opportunity of this election to ensure a better future for ourselves and our children. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna was excited and the Sadou people were happy. <sep><sep> Theft after theft crises have been continuing since 2008 when there was a financial crisis in Europe and the US. <sep><sep> The Israeli authorities have already started using paper to leave families, so families are preparing to organize (as the Housing Movement organized when paper was stuck on the door) against this possible forced eviction. <sep><sep> And for Independence, we have found that this year, Diego Garcia is at the forefront. <sep><sep> And communal mobilizations only inevitably reflect the balance of class forces, to a large extent change it. <sep><sep> However, during the MSM period, they were present in the trade union platform activities at the DWC and legal examinations at SC/HSC. <sep><sep> The youth have considered it a language so inferior compared to English and French that they cannot use it in a formal setting. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, we must understand that it is an absolutely ridiculous method, but yet he manages to make everyone accept it. <sep> But, he gains something else: he gains status as a "great unionist." <sep> where there are also other members of No Bases present, and where LALIT can strengthen its struggle against military bases in general. <sep> We have rebuilt, we continue to rebuild, but we are not resting on our laurels. <sep> This power of the President to make the feudal, colonial Lordship a lasting power. <sep> We have joined forces with the CHA and CAWU unions to protest against the CHA's harsh treatment of construction workers and demand that houses be repaired rather than demolished. <sep> On a national level, we have participated in Congress, Political Education, tractor distribution, book launches by the STATE, and in the Front for Food Security. <sep> When we take stock, sometimes we forget the long hours of reflection, coordination, and care that LALIT activists put in to strengthen Party structures. <sep> He says in his LPT work experience it is unique worldwide. <sep> That the government brings a Constitutional Amendment to enshrine the right to strike as a fundamental right. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the anti-lager bra movement, eco-friendly section movements, party family movements in the world, we will now move to the new phase of literature.<sep> Honore had the Toulsiwala tribe in the Kamomia, in the west of the Yapanama tribe and in the region of Citronela.<sep> Advertisements for a new legal and administrative card to encourage optimal use of agricultural land.<sep> Nobody knew why, but many people felt a special duty, a feeling of goodness that couldn't be explained.<sep> It makes you know, believe, and agree when he says "This is not Africa, this is not a foreign country, this is Mauritius and we are democratic here."<sep> So, at the level of society, people began to have reflections on the social class structure, even on Marxism.<sep> Will there be a vote to leave, will the lottery oversee elections, where to place the stamp, how to count the votes, and will there be bins (containers for the deposits).<sep> Whether you find yourself preparing for a Creole exam for the first time in history for a million trainees in your area.<sep> The bombardment continuing in South Lebanon by Israeli aviation forms part of the same strategy to spread terror among the civilian population of the region.<sep> On the other hand, we will have to denounce the misconduct and bureaucratic methods, expose them for what they are. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Regarding national security, we are against the proliferation of contractual work. <sep><sep> Lulu brought a special apple cake with a special sesame seed tart with sheep cheese and sesame seeds topped with orange glaze from Nablus. <sep><sep> But, it is a manifesto almost identical to the Workers' Manifesto and MMM and MSM and PMSD - a bit more boring and vague. <sep><sep> In military academies, in schools for soldiers. <sep><sep> And they have always been influenced by this capitalist ideology, since the time when it was dominant. <sep><sep> We are not only fighting against a section in the Nomination Paper; we are fighting against the whole communal lapse in the Best Loser system. <sep><sep> Later today (5 Ziyet), the Best Loser will be nominated by the Electoral Supervisory Commission (ESC), as provided for by law. <sep><sep> Just as capitalism is an eternal system, where nothing will ever change, what has happened is that the concept of class struggle has been slightly twisted, has been put in a corner. <sep><sep> Four men have died, each time my  hands tied behind my back, no one has violated me each in turn. <sep><sep> I have found this happening, and happening again, and happening yet again. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Vinesh Hookoomsing made a speech at the reverse launch and engagement. <sep> In 1980, after the great popular movement, the direction of the MMM sank at the Milan La Louise cinema, noticed another cinema building. <sep> This series of seminars and conferences has constituted our self-education. <sep> The importance of this book, since the modern ecological movement has become strong, from the 70s, 75s, especially in Europe, USA, Japan. <sep> When Marx made his call in the First International Conference, it was for "The Working People of the Whole World Must Unite". <sep> Because an economy has its limits to its expansion, if the State gives attention to develop a bourgeois section, it will undoubtedly oppress the other. <sep> His wife is very ill, his children are in Jordan, without his volunteer support he cannot come to the rescue. <sep> There is a course in China where it is questioning its militaristic politics, asking for a decrease in military budget, asking to close certain military bases. <sep> Before, notes were in all languages spoken in Mauritius, but not in Creole. <sep> Lindsey Collen, who was also present for Lalit, said she accompanied a family group to pick herbs two months ago, to know where they needed to go to get the herbs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When facing a checkpoint, on the left side of the road, there is a settlement called Bakva on a hill. <sep><sep> For this, the Orders in Council of 1965 must be considered. <sep><sep> But, at least for the first time in history, an amount has been allocated for insurance (Rs 15 million) for non-sugar plantations, and for incentives for non-sugar plantations (Rs 30 million for onion and potato seeds). <sep><sep> Are you filling your head with nonsense? - Excuse Me. <sep><sep> It is a fake by professionals, by a special breed of mafia who were born in this vacuum. <sep><sep> The four crew members managed to escape before the crash. <sep><sep> There are 14,000 Cuban doctors who have treated 80,000 patients in Venezuela. <sep><sep> But, in 2008, it has been noticed that through a collusive relationship with the Government, the Labor Party-PMSD has launched a subtly but dangerously scheme of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) for reasons that follow: <sep><sep> When workers are being exploited, when they are being misled in the long term, it is worth the trouble for them to take control. <sep><sep> But once again, is the ethanol produced in Mauritius more environmentally friendly than the ethanol that can be imported from major producers like Brazil? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This has led to a drastic drop in the value of all assets, making capital less readily available. <sep> <sep> So even if the market is more buoyant, there are many people who no longer have income, because there are no jobs. <sep> <sep> It is clear that countries like America, China, and India have geopolitical interests in this region. <sep> <sep> In 50 years there will be dangerous, irreversible consequences. <sep> <sep> But systematically, Ashok Subron has managed to block all of these forces by maintaining that there are no problems. <sep> <sep> At the time of the merger, the citadel was being built in another place. <sep> <sep> Now, we are reorganizing our buildings to continue digitizing all our documents. <sep> <sep> So it was a very simple, very summary class analysis. <sep> <sep> A true political party with which a union identifies itself, it proposes economic alternatives; <sep> <sep> At a certain moment there were discussions about what we call the Joint Mauritian-British Fisheries Monitoring. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He works as a secretary in the direction, and he is a political activist. <sep> <sep> We are demanding the decriminalization of abortion, there is a second dynamic. <sep> <sep> There are governments concentrating on sovereignty, neglecting the Chagossians and colluding with the base. <sep> <sep> Q: Cyber security sector, does Lalit believe in it? <sep> <sep> This started before elections when there was a forum, Media Watch and Gender Links actions, the Federation was formed, and protests and petitions were made, Majority Party took the lead. <sep> <sep> And we have the first 2 Debate Forums in a series, namely Richelieu on April 10, and Riviere Noire on April 19, and the campaign intensifies from May. <sep> <sep> And it can also be used in French and Bhojpuri, both, (not just French, as it is today). <sep> <sep> The alliance's color reminds us of the retrogressive movement, the French colonies. <sep> <sep> But the victory is still incomplete without decolonizing the education system. <sep> <sep> We do not get the impression that there was enough precautions taken between February 13 and March 30. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The novel was originally selling for Rs 250 and now it is available for Rs 350. <sep><sep> On the logical side, it doesn't matter who won the election in Rose Belle! <sep><sep> And today, it spends what it's forced to retract. <sep><sep> As I said, maybe for the first time the llama must have felt, in the early morning when he goes to milk his offspring, when he sends his children to school, when he looks for a job for his 16-17 year old children. <sep><sep> Cindy Clelie was included in a Prime Minister's list during her presidency. <sep><sep> Like what happened to me in GWF for example in 1982. <sep><sep> It is the major state Orange (France Telecom-Mauritius Telecom) that is responsible for that kind of repression. <sep><sep> And it is precisely this quite hard confrontation between the Chagossian family and the Lalit family against RIOT that has shaped the future on the issue of Diego Garcia and Chagos. <sep><sep> In a short moment, just before midnight, all the lights go out, the curtain disappears and the artists melt. <sep><sep> This same kind of ideology sits between being ‘Mauritian, not Mauritian’. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As long as there is insecurity in employment, the problem of poverty will remain. <sep><sep> And when it comes to the "Mechanism for Transitional Support to the Private Sector," this also clearly indicates that the system is flawed, a system that is faltering. <sep><sep> There is also the possibility for you to coordinate a Commission, like this year Rajni Lallah is coordinating the Family Commission, Alain Ah-Vee is coordinating the Education and Language Commission. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have observed how the IMF influences economic and political policies through the MMM, and how the MMM's direction has made compromises on the economy. <sep><sep> - The repression of our mother tongue hinders our ability to make our voices heard in society, limiting participation and weakening democracy; <sep><sep> Our Black River Regional Meeting has been held twice and sometimes in conjunction with Port Louis' regional conference. <sep><sep> Since 5 years ago, there has been a mobilization campaign against the Miray Apartheid, which Israel is building on Palestinian territory, in defiance of international law and human rights. <sep><sep> Neither the Feminist League, nor the Association of Mauritian Women, nor the Family Liberation Movement, nor the Mauritius Alliance of Women, nor the Soroptimist. <sep><sep> It is a way that I use when another country produces something more sophisticated. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, Lalit has organized a demonstration in front of the American Embassy against war and occupation, and has participated in the Chagossian demonstrations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is important is the moment when Mrs. Vev Kaya formally accused these 3 policemen, Dr. <sep><sep> On Friday 1st March in the morning, LALIT distributed leaflets in the areas of Kirpip, Kat-Born, Rozil, Porlwi Lenor and Sid. <sep><sep> The article in the UN Convention definition states that "genocide means [also] causing serious physical or mental harm to a group of people" (in our case in Mauritius it refers to 93% of the Mauritian population who speak Creole. <sep><sep> Chagossians, all these exiled Mauritians from their homeland, have taken their case to the Supreme Court in Great Britain: they have the right to return to Chagos. <sep><sep> There was a big, big manifestation in the streets, a long period of time manifestation after the 60-0 elections. <sep><sep> It is a festival where there are great jazz artists from 4 continents as well as from Madagascar, even coming to play in all kinds of concert forms: in open-air, in pubs, in halls. <sep><sep> Living in Jericho was allowing them to have better development than in the Ganges valley where hunger and discrimination against the unemployed were major issues. <sep><sep> The Social Alliance has also launched a campaign with the slogan 'put people first' where they promise: Free transport for school children, democratization of the economy. <sep><sep> 75% go into agriculture, the other 25% go into the land value. <sep><sep> LALIT supports craftsmen and workers in their struggle to improve working conditions and increase their wages. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Among the topics discussed are education, gender and patriarchy, ecology, globalization, imperialism, militarism, and peace. <sep><sep> If it starts a political process, it appears that it is starting with this FPU ready-made facade. <sep><sep> This move has the typical Mauritian government attitude: threatening to raise the Diego Garcia issue in the UN to force the UK to negotiate on sovereignty issues. <sep><sep> This has been done with the complicity of their allies and today they are still suffering discrimination. <sep><sep> However, it can become a caricature, but what it ends up exposing is something important, especially when it comes to their religious "communities". <sep><sep> It has done extraordinary work presenting a fact. <sep><sep> JUSTICE has done this through victim and victim's family organization. <sep><sep> There is frustration in the police force, and Rama Valayden appears to want to express this anger. <sep><sep> They were just waiting for an opportunity to show their weaknesses. <sep><sep> Police beatings to get a confession, then NHRC says it will not interfere until the "main case" is affected. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How has the government and political parties and "opinion leaders" responded to the new US strategy to eliminate the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace? <sep><sep> Now the government is proposing electoral system reform but maintaining the "best-loser" system. <sep><sep> And the anger of Gaza inhabitants and occupied territories is rising. <sep><sep> We are in a context where there is division in this class. <sep><sep> But, as a socialist activist, here I am reiterating a point Kisna made - that his goal is not to weaken the trade union. <sep><sep> A confrontation between a Palestinian athlete and an Israeli soldier is happening, with atrocious oppression in Palestine where there are daily deaths in Palestine going unnoticed. <sep><sep> Lindsey mentioned that, just as in the Trade Union, so much of the activities carried out were so strictly centralized that we have been working at an ultra-strict level, as in the Commission. <sep><sep> And, funny enough, even if we put on a mask, dive, dive into it, we will not understand big words when we look under the sea anymore. <sep><sep> People will have many difficulties choosing between these two alliances. <sep><sep> LALIT supports the demand for the mother tongue as a medium that the LPT, Terre de Paix, ABAIM, Play-group have submitted to the Prime Minister in the Creole Language Day framework. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> without any ambition to realign the economy between its main pillars or its dependence on oil and coal production. <sep><sep> Labor and artisan unions should consider building a sustainable future by reflecting on past mistakes and successes. <sep><sep> Whether it be in an agricultural policy based on profit and an erroneous way to replace fossil fuel, it is likely to trigger a global food crisis. <sep><sep> The government is also responsible for the fact that schools and mass media are their direct tools in the linguistic genocide of Bhojpuri and Creole. <sep><sep> You are not just looking for a larger piece of the capitalist pie. <sep><sep> LALIT, since 2003, we have been campaigning in favor of a plan that shifts towards truly renewable energy sources. <sep><sep> They laugh, because they need a sector where there was less class consciousness in England at that time. <sep><sep> We also support an electoral reform that allows for the Better Loser System. <sep><sep> So, they tend to take vital actions for the masses to have less importance than their own interests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> BLS continues after Zizman Balancy, and Bérenger still says he won't be All BLS. <sep> <sep> And then, when the Government, its armed wing, suffered defeat, what happened? <sep> <sep> So we have decided to publish a publication to express these criticisms, and at the same time to explain the events studied, and the struggles where the unionists are going through, and also to put our theoretical analysis. <sep> <sep> In this Assembly, no one has brought up this report. <sep> <sep> The social situation in Jericho was pushing Afro-Creoles into its claws - poverty, exclusion, racism. <sep> <sep> When we were in the MMM trend, then too, we were calling ourselves either "class struggle tendency", or "advanced worker class trend". <sep> <sep> We are laughing, we are happy, we are crying, we are expressing what we think in the way we are forced to express ourselves. <sep> <sep> Everyday work is still illegal in most cases, which is a permanent language barrier for most. <sep> <sep> We are looking at this phase in a way that shows the way in which auto-activity oppresses people and brings progress. <sep> <sep> Show people, especially women, that reading and writing have become their first step. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the electoral campaign, we focused a lot on the economic and social crisis that is affecting the working class and all poor people. <sep><sep> He will invite Darlmah Naick on his HARDTALK program. <sep><sep> This means that at 60, he has proven to be more than 50. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah, who presided over the meeting, explained that the Lalit Party decided in a member meeting on 4th April not to participate in this election, mainly for two reasons. <sep><sep> 3 working class among the whole class, that's without looking at the sector, without looking at affiliations, without looking at whether they are in unions, without looking at the political side, in short, a mass of workers. <sep><sep> In the 2011 partial elections, there was a tie between MR and OPR. <sep><sep> Following an allegation that Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen insulted and harassed a police officer. <sep><sep> Xavier’s PMXD, M.Allet’s PMSD, and R.Valayden’s MR will merge to re-form PMSD. <sep><sep> Then, whether it is 5, 10, or 15 delegates from Medine coming to the SILU-UASI National delegate meeting in Lari Moka. <sep><sep> He gave him a clear day to do this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, the working class had to be at the forefront of the struggle. <sep><sep> This means, as in Mauritius in the '70s and especially in the world, the working class is paying for this debt, among the "Structural Adjustment Programs" - SAPs as they were called in English. <sep><sep> On the question of giving Diego the base, he said "there is no illusion, it will automatically renew." <sep><sep> When Minister Mohammed withdrew his amendment, every section of the union bureaucracy fought back, claiming paternity for this "victory." <sep><sep> Every speech represents an articulation between politics and economics, theory and practice, program and interest, idea and action, class and party, meanwhile they are in a process of articulation between each of these levels. <sep><sep> Additionally it causes damage in natural development of intelligence. <sep><sep> Three councils left Timi's party voluntarily. <sep><sep> In general, they are claiming a part of it as well. How do we justify this position in our work sector? <sep><sep> For example, a growing interest in the Creole language. <sep><sep> And we wanted to reduce dependence on imports, especially on imported energy sources. <sep>   <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the BAI conglomerate, on the other hand, according to the "economic democratization policy according to the Labor Party", continues to consolidate its dominance vis-à-vis traditional monopolies such as Rogers and IBL. <sep><sep> It says its 'immunity system' is defending itself against humanity to serve itself, and its consequences on humanity - because humanity is putting it in danger as an organism in danger - it will be very harmful. <sep><sep> On spelling and grammar, they have no margin of maneuver. <sep><sep> Its governmental program that it aimed for the 1976 General Election still emphasized on job creation in agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> And finally, with nationalism, we have come to believe that all Mauritians are equal, everyone is equal on Earth, there is already one single humanity, which is completely strong, because there are always groups of people getting great privileges when a large majority are forced to work hard to get a meal voucher. <sep><sep> For example, between ICT Minister Chedumbrum Pillay and Mauritius Telecom. <sep><sep> Today Israel is continuing its military occupation and colonization of Palestine. <sep><sep> And we have continued this campaign for 5 years, and it has borne fruit. <sep><sep> Why did I come to make this testimony, it is because when I said a Zilwa, a comrade who has joined us in this struggle, he told me that he is fighting even though he is not fighting to shoot Americans and their nuclear weapons. <sep><sep> Israel has recently declared Negev Prison as a normal prison and has declared that prisoners will no longer have mobile phones. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I will finish by proposing a topic for discussion in the small group. <sep><sep> A conspiracy to uproot all Chagossians, to cook Chagos altogether, and to convert what was supposed to become a peaceful "signaling station" into a major military base for US soldiers, sailors, and researchers. <sep><sep> The Ministry of Education has approved the creation of a Creole Unit in the MIE and training for teachers to teach Creole. <sep><sep> He met with the late Trevor Huddleston, who was the Anglican Bishop of Mauritius and the founder of the global anti-apartheid movement. <sep><sep> According to official testimony from the US Navy, it took 5 to 6 attempts to refloat the two submarines. <sep><sep> It is clear that LALIT is a political party that has strong ties with the trade unions: <sep><sep> Timi suspected that it was Aisha Bibi, Mr. Ibrahim's daughter, who was making the work at the shop interesting. <sep><sep> Large student demonstrations, for the first time in a long while, in the UK. <sep><sep> Furthermore, military jeeps circulated during the night, lighting up the villages. <sep><sep> Are they providing necessary training for teachers to use Creole in schools? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many still remember the 57 million "compensation" that the first MMM-PSM government offered to the establishment. <sep> This means encouraging farmers to use more herbicides and pesticides. <sep> We need to stop this practice. This will also ensure safety against the risk of accidents or internal nuclear disasters that threaten the lives of the entire population. <sep> Recently, there has been increasing pressure from the Federation Creole Mauricien (FCM) and the Voice of Hindu (VOH) as well. <sep> This progress is evident especially through organizations I have mentioned, such as LPT and LALIT, among others, Playgroup, ABAIM, writers. <sep> But it must be done WITHOUT any visitors, even if the visitors are somewhat secure. <sep> The general election of 1976 represented a turning point in the history of elections in Mauritius because there was a new political force, MMM, and also in 1976, it was a time when we had just come out of a long State of Emergency that began in the 1970s. <sep> * Twin brothers Issam (23) and Alla 25. <sep> and also poses the question of whether it is not the result of the fact that capitalist import cartels have arrangements to increase prices. <sep> Despite Obama's campaign focusing on 'sanctions', nothing has changed in his foreign policy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are often 3-4 other police officers who have been accused of beating in court. <sep> <sep> But a systemic crisis, as its name implies, wants to say that its economy is starting to destabilize, threaten. <sep> <sep> Can we not say that women are equal to men if we consider how much cultural and social penalties weigh on women, as they are still handling the household chores when they return home, or are still receiving peace of mind for the same work that a man does? <sep> <sep> Today, we do not agree with the Weekend, for example, that it is also being boycotted. <sep> <sep> Regarding trade unions, there has been a consensus on the government's White Paper on IRA. <sep> <sep> 4. There are certain working conditions that are becoming increasingly internationalized. <sep> <sep> One of the things that happened last week is when someone is arrested, they have the right to legal aid, from the moment they are arrested. <sep> <sep> The last meeting I announced was like a radio lottery in Mauritius during an election campaign. <sep> <sep> But most importantly, I want to learn to read, write, read big books and newspapers. <sep> <sep> So, the Academy is a victory for all those involved. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> From Budrus - today's protest was cancelled because tear gas stopped the construction site. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam is present at the anniversary of VOH and FCM. <sep><sep> We have long had links with the organization, with connections in various parties around the world. <sep><sep> multinationals are taking advantage of us to profit a few wealthy individuals and make a dance of life on our devastated land. <sep><sep> we need to subsidize transportation of goods that go to other parts forming the Republic like Rodrigues and Agalega. <sep><sep> In LALIT we are actively confronting bourgeois politics, questioning its economic system. <sep><sep> He chose his own circle to share the loot with, people with whom he had affection and felt a connection. <sep><sep> So that there can be more true employment in agriculture and agro-industry. <sep><sep> He has gone to dam up the torrents in the drought-afflicted areas for food production back in 1980. <sep><sep> Yesterday we found a way where Bizlall organized a demonstration against the new labor law in Rose Hill on September 1, and Subron organized his "thanksgiving" meeting on September 2 in Port Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have also contacted all trade union federations, we explained to them how we started working on an alternative economic policy, we hoped to have a meeting to discuss this. <sep> <sep> And also in politics, geopolitics, sociology itself, authors between 1922-3 and 1995 have an atmosphere of "past" or even "overcome" when you read them. <sep> <sep> Meaning we propose converting land where sugarcane is currently grown to growing vegetables and fruits. <sep> <sep> In the past in Mauritius, often, we find that people who don't know English, don't know French, try to guess what people are saying. <sep> <sep> We met 3 times, at Grand River and Quirin. <sep> <sep> B-1 is a bomber capable of carrying 40 tons of bombs and can be equipped to carry nuclear weapons. <sep> <sep> All this is happening in a context where there are many protests. <sep> <sep> So, these macho attitudes are one of the factors that lead to this fragmentation. <sep> <sep> Look at this linearity with the Resistance and Block 104 before, then Bizlall. <sep> <sep> through these agreements, compromises with Great Britain, the Zini State will get quotas, guaranteed prices for sugar, textiles. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They made people believe that no one should ever breathe a word for the establishment that it must plant food on one part of its land. <sep><sep> It is MMM and MSM who initiated the Blue-print and VRS work for workers, when they are using the capital that the EU has given, to 'rationalize' the sugar industry. <sep><sep> Come on, your dad has collected misfortune, taken home to your mom; in her grief, your poor mom without her knowing has let misfortune enter his nose, take away your blessings. <sep><sep> When Mrs. Thatcher introduced secret ballot, she formed a party strategy that the international bourgeois was leading to the fight against the concept of class struggle. <sep><sep> There was Jhurry, there was Antoine Chavrimootoo, there was Paul Berenger, there was even him. <sep><sep> Is the Labour Party developing a new link with France, through the Tromlin concession, and the visit of the Prime Minister to Reunion as a form of recognition of a colony? <sep><sep> Those who make decisions on the family, and their responsibility is what is called "bringing a lord" or "straightening" the family. <sep><sep> Now that you've turned against me, it's clear you have this kind of desire in you.' - 'You're reading my mind, Tantinn.' - 'Of course! <sep><sep> So, offering and amusing, we had the pleasure of revolutionary movement experiences, but not succeeding. <sep><sep> It involved 400 people in a special rallying place, and between 1:00 and 3:00 pm, there were several speakers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the economists of the World Bank have assumed that the number of retirees has only decreased by half. <sep><sep>  In this case, we must understand that in the future, their enemies will make more people not receive a pension. <sep><sep>  But we didn't know it would be so much on the missile. <sep><sep>  And he may be aware that he is facing a classroom challenge. <sep><sep>  Everyone who visits the LALIT website will be happy to hear that there is now a virtual Morisian-Creole English dictionary. <sep><sep>  But there is another issue that we should spend a minute talking about: all these traditional parties, they have used a capitalist marketing method for their part. <sep><sep>  What I know is that the power in work today is the same strict power of enslavement time, the same strict power of linguistic time, it comes the same, until today where 90% of people sell their labor in years with someone private. or with the state which provides this class of "private individuals" service. <sep><sep>  In the case of malaria where a young child died Ram Seegobin said that he is referring to this case to show how traditional parties have reached an unacceptable degree of hypocrisy. <sep><sep>  Betamax Targeted People; Jeetah Economic Sector group; Tinker licenses. <sep><sep>  Legal, it is Keshore Pertab, who was the lawyer of Shabeel in the keys where this girl was risking 10 years in prison for abortion, intervened. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recently, in the last 6 months, we have found 2 federations, GWF and FPU, coming out 2 Federations to almost 6 Federations. <sep><sep> Also, in the same way, there is a regionalist shift where parents and their children may prefer to choose closer schools to avoid spending too much time on initial transport. <sep><sep> Why do they hide the existence of this story so much? <sep><sep> Without necessarily establishing another kind of link in its place, without necessarily creating more stable employment. <sep><sep> In 1982, Minister Cuttaree refused to take a position against CIA infiltration in the Mauritian trade union through the AALC (Afro-American Labour Congress) when Lalit and several trade unions were denouncing it. <sep><sep> To resist against the tyranny imposed by the bosses. <sep><sep> "I feel I have learned a lot when I did this work to collect these articles. <sep><sep> There is intense pressure for the United Nations to completely abandon the I.O.Z.P. project. <sep><sep> The leader of this historic bloc was a big planter, planting with hundreds of acres of sugarcane, which, through the political power of the early days of universal suffrage, became a section of the bourgeoisie known as the "state bourgeoisie". <sep><sep> But where we are today, with the crisis in Europe, the Euro is at risk of collapsing in the coming weeks, in the months ahead, so people are holding onto their Dollars, for that matter. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT has the pleasure of publishing an article about LPT that has already happened to us, and that has already happened in Le Mauricien paz Forum (Saturday 12th February, 2011). <sep><sep> WOSA has never managed to truly give birth, in such difficult times. <sep><sep> Timi remembered well when his aunt got married to a guy who took care of all the household chores. <sep><sep> It is political parties that are somewhat popular that go to establish union disputes that occur within unions. <sep><sep> He became active in the anti-occupation movement from a young age. <sep><sep> LALIT brought a campaign against the MMM Government, which was implementing an ultra-liberal policy for 5 years. <sep><sep> Yesterday, in the Intermediate Court, Madam Macque explained how in 2002, her husband told her that the police had beaten him. <sep><sep> The last point I would have liked to make is, when we look at yellow analyzes and the yellows that we are using for strategies, something for us to keep in mind. <sep><sep> LALIT member, Rada Kistnasamy, is currently in Cape Town where he is pursuing a course at the Project for Alternative Education in Southern Africa (PRAESA) at the University of Cape Town. <sep><sep> The Employment’s Rights Act (ERA) was voted on in 2008 and replaced the Labour Act, and then ERA was amended freshly, within 2-3 months of that time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are separate work areas for boys and girls. <sep><sep> When confusion had reached its peak, Samazeste in a sudden address stated that he would no longer be able to continue his mission because his heart was closing. <sep><sep> Today we have no crown, Disik Protocol dismantled. <sep><sep> The Lalyansde Labor has a policy that favors the interests of employers when seeking solutions to address the crisis in the security and textile industry. <sep><sep> This would allow more interested citizens to express their own opinions and contribute to the debate on wages. <sep><sep> This year, it has been 40 years since Palestinians have been under Israeli military occupation. <sep><sep> The press' "duty" in this context: cash all of it. <sep><sep> Also, the 'pro-life' issue needs to be looked at in terms of the mother's life. <sep><sep> In Ziyet, we had our “School-of-Struggle” with theoretical and practical sessions on politics for young people and new LALIT sympathizers. <sep><sep> The UK has sold out the Chagos Islands, and the Americans act as resellers, then we, who have a "high moral ground", the government of Mauritius, through mainstream political parties, act in such a way with a secret strategy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Tariq Ramadan and Prof Juggessur have not taken a stance against the Best Loser system, when Lindsey Collen denounced it. <sep><sep> militant protesters of an alternative community, when the Stalinist reaction was aligning with Churchill and Roosevelt, when the Communist Party in all other parts of the world was attacking the alternative community. <sep><sep> * One of the main functions of the State is to guarantee the necessary conditions for capitalist production. <sep><sep> Is it not astonishing how this machine that sits on the worker's sofa has become the master? <sep><sep> It is quite remarkable how politicians use a system that indeed serves the interests of the entire population, in the end, serves their own interests. <sep><sep> ASSOCIATION AGAINST VIOLENCE BY OFFICERS OF THE STATE, which in turn, works hard to expose and reduce police violence and torture. <sep><sep> During confrontations between the police and the settlers, members of Rabbis for Peace (Raben, Father Zwif, pur Lape) were also present. <sep><sep> This is not within the framework of job creation, but rather within the framework of repression, facing an economic crisis that the well-known Minister is seriously threatening. <sep><sep> Your situation in Mauritius is high and it is even becoming somewhat sustainable. <sep><sep> If we continue on this same path where we disconnect labor and political struggles, we will continue to struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So he also developed an interest in the production of music <sep><sep> And these 2 things were very important that day: the police were beating women, and the women were fighting the police until the police surrendered. <sep><sep> So today, when we talk about "the economy in crisis" with our colleagues, friends, and neighbors, there are 3 levels of significance: <sep><sep> It means that if the Opposition continues to challenge development projects (and many of them are worth challenging), it will enforce the law to prevent what it calls "economic sabotage". <sep><sep> If you have a lot of money, you can do a legal transaction, you can just take a plane, and you can do a medical procedure under good conditions. <sep><sep> LALIT invited its members to attend the demonstration and also gave advice to workers in their respective sectors to be present. <sep><sep> Colony Ariel and its outposts have invaded more land in Marda. <sep><sep> In the beginning, we haven't succeeded - for a thousand reasons. But we are on the right track. <sep><sep> We have analyzed 2 cases that have reached the Privy Council: the Olivier Bancoult case and the Block 104 case. <sep><sep> GWF has submitted copies of these 3 motions to Minister Soodhoun. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 99% of the work has been completed. Do you agree with what has been agreed upon? <sep><sep> Naturally, this is not a fixed reality, and it will change. <sep><sep> Essentially, this network argues for the importance of strong military bases, where we are fighting against this steadfast commitment to militarism, with a commitment to decolonization, reparations, and the rights of the Chagossians. <sep><sep> Now, it has also reached the public sector, with a new Federation initiated by Rashid Imrith. <sep><sep> Madelaine David, whose son was found dead in the police station; we support her. <sep><sep> In recent weeks, I have been reading about several large countries like China, Russia, which we normally, in the past, did not. <sep><sep> And in that regard, we also need to consider it, I will just mention it, through the same religions, through communalism? <sep><sep> When you watch closely in the film when they arrive at the Cathedral, on YouTube, the speeches are moving. <sep><sep> There are also certain people in the elite (what is called "petty bourgeoisie" in a technical sense), who are against the Mauritian Creole language, and they also often oppose Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> In the context of an almost constant increase in CEB's paper electricity bills, and faced with a series of entire family deaths used as an excuse for paper bills. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "Kwik-kwik! Kwik-kwik-kwik!" It was as if the bird was saying, "Ayo! Ayoyo!" The bird was standing on its head. <sep> <sep> MSM left the MMM party, it also evolved a lot, relied on power, and evolved. <sep> <sep> And then we develop this class analysis where we identify a detailed bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> So I find it extraordinary this debate we are having today, because we are starting to understand with more precision the contradictions that exist. <sep> <sep> MSM - he was called a less criminal system. <sep> <sep> There was a debate on the way in Rodrigues, there was a pilot project for the pomdamur Sirius. <sep> <sep> And at the same time, there was a 'dega' appearance, through its Democratization Committee. <sep> <sep> LALIT is witnessing a true revolution, not just a slight improvement for the working class. <sep> <sep> A bug calls Daruty, and a bug calls Ramlakhan. <sep> <sep> As for the Alliance, there is confusion about where they are holding their meetings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He sent a message to the end of his army camps. <sep><sep> Dinesh proposed to give Timi carte blanche to do what needs to be done. <sep><sep> At the same time, we found a rapprochement between the MMM and the Democratic Party in America: Prem Nababsing together with Gaetan Duval present at the US Democratic Party congress and the MMM refused to take a position against the Lalibi bombing by American planes in 1986. <sep><sep> This CNT restriction plan hasn't gone, it's still there. <sep><sep> But Mauritius is not contesting BIOT and is not asserting its sovereignty over the Chagos. <sep><sep> The MMM, on the other hand, does not have a great political option to offer. <sep><sep> Everyone is encouraged to consume new products that are more ecological, safer for the environment, more "green". <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam seems to be saying he is proposing it. <sep><sep> In the first place, Zini State relied heavily on debt, but now it has reached its limit. <sep><sep> We are ending the year by supporting the fight for Gaza since Ramadan. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, LALIT's findings show that the official language in Parliament, where we are, speaks Creole 84% of the time, but the deputies go to sit under our name. <sep>
<sep> If our program says we need to reclaim property rights, whoever owns and controls the land, the majority of workers will agree. <sep>
<sep> In 2007, the Minister of Labor published a code on workers' participation in decision-making and financial participation in companies. <sep>
<sep> We were in a point - something like a base - which means my father was working as a mason. <sep>
<sep> If the establishment does not agree, the government should impose taxes on all vacant land that is not being cultivated. <sep>
<sep> So we, undersigned, are formally submitting a request to the Government to introduce Mauritian Creole language, and where necessary Creole and Bhojpuri, as a medium to teach subjects like Mathematics, Science, History, Geography in schools. <sep>
<sep> How will our article fit here with the ongoing literature in other countries in our region and globally as well? <sep>
<sep> In their heads, Tantinn Timi became a lonely man, and graffiti began to appear on the walls, sometimes insulting the villagers. <sep>
<sep> We said we will "start" in this debate, not in a forum or discussion. <sep>
<sep> Since 2004, two of our members, Alain and Kisna, have been to Palestine. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was an occasion where the students from LSE had shared with friends in Australia the classroom experiences working in difficult moments in Mauritius and Indonesia. <sep><sep> Is this an advanced case, then, is this happening in the belly of the beast? <sep><sep> So, we need to see how they are manipulating us. <sep><sep> Political Party, Program, Support, Political Action = all at the same time <sep><sep> Call Rabis for Human Rights to confirm with the soldiers. <sep><sep> Today we are going to Hares School at 7 in the morning, then we are going to Bit Amin for a gate and checkpoint. <sep><sep> And both parties have been very close with the state in power for a long time. <sep><sep> The law that replaces IRA is imposing collective negotiation between unions and employers, while it weakens the working class and the union against the employers. <sep><sep> And everyone knows that subcontracting depends heavily on large companies. <sep><sep> According to an old Ottoman law (which was a pirate that took care of the Palestinians until 1914), land that is abandoned between 2 to 3 years becomes property without an owner and colonizers can acquire these lands. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Israel continues to occupy and impose sanctions on all movements towards Israel. <sep><sep> The Lalit press conference today was chaired by Rada Kistnasamy in the Lalit office, Grand Riviere. <sep><sep> The Labour Party has not been able to show that it has an alternative core policy. <sep><sep> Team partner Ramba who, after a serious disappointment (Mukesh had a disagreement with him), joined a singles religious association. <sep><sep> The Labour Party Council members boycotted the first meeting due to the sea at Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill, a PMSD, saying they prefer to leave the Alliance to vote with the majority, which Prime Minister Ramgoolam threatens to take action. <sep><sep> so it was a momentous occasion to bring the debate on what was a programme, and a commitment based on this programme to bring a unity for a political alternative. <sep><sep> One of these units is on the job section. <sep><sep> He chose to hold the celebration in "Plas" which was named after the movement leader who was against independence, and who was responsible for initiating a communal movement against independence. <sep><sep> I have managed to get a child over there in Peros Banos. <sep><sep> *  We have entered NO US BASES, a network that groups together 105 anti-military base organizations worldwide. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then there is an unbearable tension between leaders as we find in the relationship of the First of May Movement and the United Front, and in the General Workers' Federation when pre-revolutionary times pass, the MMM manipulates to remove members of the LALIT outside of the union, and ultimately the MMM must withdraw too, and today the GWF is splitting and threatening further division;<sep><sep> Demand for textiles and clothing is declining in US markets.<sep><sep> In particular, this group would be able to prove that there is not a single word or sentence in what Marx has written that justifies Stalinism.<sep><sep> We found together various sections of the social class to debate to defend each other's interests when the systemic crisis attacks it.<sep><sep> The government did not pass a special law to force the establishment to diversify their food production by a percentage of (22%) of their arable land.<sep><sep> Then, when we arrived in front of the UK Commissioner, Ms Lasose, we all stood still.<sep><sep> - Damnation! Blasphemy! He is saying that God is a hermaphrodite.<sep><sep> The new law that replaced the IRA, is largely based on the White Paper that former Minister Soodhun presented in 2004, under the MMM-MSM government.<sep><sep> But, you know, when a union, 2 unions, decide to tell workers not to participate in this strike, then you know the matter has become serious.<sep><sep> He went over the text again and then went to look at his copier Ernest who was a great professional organizer who was always very busy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Dr. Kwezi Prah, an expert in African languages, thinks it would be interesting to publish every key in about 17 languages which he calls "core languages". <sep><sep> The global food crisis is characterized by scarcity and rising food prices. <sep><sep> "Furthermore, [Resistance and Alternatives] maintain that when they do not categorize themselves, it will not affect the implementation of the Bestloser System." <sep><sep> We have published a hundred titles in Creole, all kinds of books. <sep><sep> Even though Navin Ramgoolam has announced that negotiations are in process, the problems regarding sugar and molasses planters are supposed to be resolved, it remains uncertain. <sep><sep> The German, UK, and Italian governments are on the defensive in Afghanistan stating that there was so much opposition to war and occupation in their respective countries. <sep><sep> In the Review, there is an Editorial, a political article, a social commentary, a column on the arts, on culture, and cartoons. <sep><sep> This should include peace talks on animals, large-scale farming, and deep-sea diving as well. <sep><sep> A publication, in which we could have a political conscience for a power change? <sep><sep> This similar exercise, 120,000 pensioners who filled out a form have disappeared. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you take all the SMEs that have started, you will regret them in 5 years, 75% of them have disappeared because they did not succeed. <sep> <sep> On the question of sovereignty, the GRC said, "We will look again later, whether we want to remain British or if we want to be Mauritian." <sep> <sep> All present comrades brought food, shared it, and everyone took a break together. <sep> <sep> A case in court, after an Order in Council decreed by the Queen becomes void on the grounds that it is not in the British interest. <sep> <sep> Where there is instability between different sections of the bourgeoisie, and even between the bourgeoisie and the petit-bourgeoisie, it insists on having more or less employment, having a job anyway. <sep> <sep> Mme Navarre and Mr. Giraud are not saying ZAME should not release a person who has raped a disabled child. <sep> <sep> A husband can beat his wife, even using "physical torture" to "correct" her; <sep> <sep> Even after defamation and imprisonment, Cehl Meeah gets 30% of the votes in a 3-way battle. <sep> <sep> We do not only look at the environment as an independent matter. <sep> <sep> This type of opposition demands a different form of capitalism, not neo-liberalism like Sithanen or Berenger. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And finally, for the government, there is recourse to this fund, if necessary, to stabilize the financial system. <sep><sep> A political party like Lalit, which has been in existence for more than 20 years, has a tradition, and has credibility. <sep><sep> He replied, in a somewhat playful spirit, that he was more like a virtual Electoral Commissioner. <sep><sep> Until such time as often Fatma asks herself whether society will one day truly become a little more tolerant. <sep><sep> Given that the economy of Mauritius is still heavily dependent on the European market for sugar, textiles, tourism, and BPO, it is not surprising that the crisis in Europe is precipitating a systemic crisis in capitalist Mauritian economy. <sep><sep> * Family planning is the responsibility of families to take care of their own. <sep><sep> Today we are going to the village of Beit Leid to meet olive planters who have their plantations on the slopes of the mountain. <sep><sep> LALIT's strategy is to increase class consciousness, but if our tactics have brought us too close to a bureaucracy as it engages in negotiations with a multinational private water company that intends to supply water in the country, we must sever that link to remain faithful to our strategy. <sep><sep> This illustrates the dance of power relations between politics and socio-religious society. <sep><sep> Sometimes baby, who was in his belly, it was Joshua. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a shame that for the first time there is a code of conduct violation signed by all candidates at the same time was the most abusive election as ever before. <sep><sep> He will say that it is "profits results", which is certainly not true. <sep><sep> He had just returned to the country with his husband, a Sinhalese from Hong Kong, named Bernard. <sep><sep> There have been 2 union presidents dismissed at Mauritius Telecom. <sep><sep> In Lyon, there is a very large electoral college that elects the President, while in Mauritius, the President is elected by a simple majority in the National Assembly, following a motion by the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> The petition was addressed to the President of the Republic of Mauritius and a copy to the governments of Holland, France, and Britain: the states that colonized Mauritius all play a role, thus directly involved in the atrocities that slavery has triggered. <sep><sep> So, for 40 years (between 1930 and 1970) there have been continuous appreciation of Marx's work on the interpretation of the relationship between matter and nature, but only among natural scientists. <sep><sep> And then, what is worth noting is, when Elizier Francois attacks Ram Seegobin, accusing him of "contesting" his own candidature, following a conflict with Balancy (Francois accused Balancy of "raising his levy"). <sep><sep> A health cooperative, Bambous Health Project, which has been running for 25 years, organizes preventive medicine, consultations, blood tests, and courses in anatomy, physiology, and immunopathology. <sep><sep> What will happen? A civil marriage was due to take place in a week if all goes well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, I will describe the difficulties in maintaining the articulation that LALIT has been able to maintain and we will continue to maintain. <sep> <sep> When Ramou was born Balram and Timi were disappointed. <sep> <sep> But, Lenin shows us that there are 2 other important factors, besides the working class as a whole, in modern capitalist society. <sep> <sep> Pursuing against Ram Seegobin was only "active" when Paul Berenger became Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> Then they hold a very patriotic rally, 3-4 times they are arrested in the streets to feel for the Motherland. <sep> <sep> On the issue of Partial Elections, Rada Kistnasamy, who was in charge, gave an explanation of exactly where we are now with Ashok Jugnauth declaring vacant. <sep> <sep> The organization like Lalit, MLF, MPRB, we have created the organization JUSTICE, and that has brought about a program. <sep> <sep> The article does not specify if these 75 families rely on people who are “studying” them. <sep> <sep> Against the military base, it also says it is intolerable for their home country to serve as a military base, which, in addition, serves to bury innocent people in Afghanistan, or be used as a pawn for renditions. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin was on Radio One on the 25th of April regarding the issue of corruption and politics in general, on the 11th of June regarding Diego Garcia, on the 13th of August regarding Repression against private Radio stations, on the 9th of September regarding Chady's resignation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After achieving good results in the second year, Timinn went to university to become a lawyer. <sep> Finished with the sun, all Mauritians, but there are already two categories that are not Mauritian, rather 'indo -' or 'sino' Mauritian. <sep> So, with great pleasure, and on behalf of all present today, M. <sep> and especially the bank that was financing the Seychelles Government and was also the owner of half of Seychelles' largest nationalized industry (Indian Ocean Tuna). <sep> It is rather the economic crisis triggered by the rise of financial capitalist power that has displaced capital into the production, especially sugar and textile industries, within the economy of a former colony, which Mauritius is. <sep>So, they do not know the history of what oppressed people have experienced or what they have known since their childhood. <sep>Then, on the first day, the Degrev Committee, Medinn Branch, sent 2-3 men who were close to him, to explain to him, talk to him where he was that evening. <sep> "Another victory that Sandra O'Reilly has brought, following her courage, we in the Family Liberation Movement have supported the demand to have Rape Crisis Units IN HOSPITALS. <sep>Gramsci wrote a book on the experience of "factory councils" in the Turin region in 1919-1920. <sep> And what is disturbing, surely a coincidence, is that MBC has put together a montage to be shown during the WIN-WIP Press Conference, where Ashok Subron and Georges Legallant were, two members of Rezistans. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Following the resignation of MSM last year, Ramgoolam and Berenger have started a series of meetings to discuss face to face, people don't really know what they are truly talking about. <sep><sep> We need to bring police brutality into public consciousness, break this silence, break the isolation of the victim and their family, create unity and strength for a demand program. <sep><sep> Isn't it the economic crisis that's driving these machinations to hasten a new political configuration in the government to create space for a coalition between PTR and MMM? <sep><sep> When we see this kind of activity, nationalistic, we in the LALIT party are somewhat skeptical. <sep><sep> There was a fairly long debate after that introduction. <sep><sep> He didn't succeed, he left, he went to form SEF. <sep><sep> On the other hand, he is taxing what is called "social vices", namely alcohol, cigarettes and gambling. <sep><sep> And this proximity is measured in kilometers, at most. <sep><sep> He had more than 30 injuries on him. <sep><sep> When his wife found out, the two women on the scene will create a scene, they will go to the police station. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Good Workers' Federation does not find any need for a Tripartite Committee on IRA, as Minister Soodhun announced yesterday in his Press Conference.<sep><sep> Now, let's examine the situation when each starts working.<sep><sep> Together during the Congress, we will consolidate the matters that LALIT already has in hand: programs that we have developed and re-activated in the last 3-4 years.<sep><sep> Secondly, a veil of lies and the hasty decision the Government itself has taken.<sep><sep> He said it was necessary to nationalize 5 factories and 20,000 arpents of land to achieve this diversification.<sep><sep> This alone was led by a family of slaves, Anade Bengale.<sep><sep> An organization within Fron, the Nursing Association, how exactly did it get involved?<sep><sep> There have been various phases in the struggle for the decriminalization of abortion.<sep><sep> They are simply not speaking about the democratic control that workers should have over their work site; they are not speaking about the role that the working class should have in decision-making on development strategies.<sep><sep> and then giving a brief summary of the proceedings in various foreign languages; then retranslating those minutes in English during the current meeting. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But today this type of action will not bring progress in the life of a free Palestinian. <sep><sep> And this will continue if we do not organize to prevent it. <sep><sep> Even it is difficult to say when we follow certain ideologies when we are under the control of the unconscious of the dominant ideology, as it is possible to distort its strict content and bypass it. <sep><sep> It seems there is no possibility of punishment beyond this horrible system. <sep><sep> They were together at the University of Kent, and he was campaigning in England. <sep><sep> This experience engraved in a diary has great importance, when we actually look at how colonization continues to oppress Palestinians as a serious issue in the Middle East. <sep><sep> But here where we put 3 times the thing has not stopped. <sep><sep> This means that it is trying to maintain its "historical block" in place, but with a new balance of forces. <sep><sep> We are the only political party that has analyzed in detail the cables from WikiLeaks on Mauritius and Seychelles, which allowed us to have a better understanding of the US's insistence on supporting the SOFA to allow its military personnel. <sep><sep> We protest when hotel owners take over public beaches, or even build artificial reefs in the Tamarin lagoon. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MMM opposition also does not seem very eager to support the Kreol language as it needs to maintain its partnership with its partner in the Remake 2000, which has never favored the advancement of the Kreol language. <sep><sep> Even if the syndicate is not happy with this kind of small advantage, the employers were providing a service to let the women go harvesting firewood in the woods during mealtime, bringing it to the house for cooking. <sep><sep> Thus, the CEB and the government are threatening to have blackouts, if not moving forward with such intensity or such promptness, and therefore are seeking an easy way to increase power production. <sep><sep> - unlike (in parallel with the first point) all corrupt political parties. <sep><sep> And we have organized forum meetings on this issue. <sep><sep> The trade union commission, as we have announced, has interpreted the new Employment Rights Act (ERiA) labor law. <sep><sep> They are entering into dialogue with the establishment, sometimes with Neeta Deerpalsing, Patrick Assirvaden President of the PT, or PT nominee Prof. Ram Seegobin to invite Jimmy Jean Louis to his program on Radio Plus on the news program at 11:00 am, Sunday 8 May. <sep><sep> If you give them another reason, they won't listen. <sep><sep> So there is a problem when defining who a 'Mauritianist' is since without mentioning whether the people who say they are Mauritianists are not automatically communalists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 2003, to respond to a systemic crisis (where many traditional economic principles had begun to fail, such as demand-led pricing and guaranteed quotas, as well as textiles). <sep> <sep> The class struggle, it is neither primarily political, nor primarily union-based. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the Government is already in preparation for elections, and their pre-electoral commission is active. <sep> <sep> Even if Navin Ramgoolam is not actively campaigning, his name is often mentioned by other ministers, Lemer, the president of various organizations, district councils, etc. <sep> <sep> Even Albie Sachs found this strange and had to comment on it in his report. <sep> <sep> Marxist theory is concerned primarily with alienation, not in the sense that workers are unhappy with their work. <sep> <sep> M. Espitalier Noel, who gave an interview conducted by Jean Claude Antoine in the Week-End 1 newspaper in 2008. <sep> <sep> This means being prepared not to retreat, to be ready to replace. <sep> <sep> Workers must stay far away from these bourgeois conspiracies, and from these communalist conspiracies. <sep> <sep> When the crisis of 2011 hits, expect capitalists to advertise even more reduction in your interest rates, and even more pressure for the depreciation of the rupee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Finansman is paying the salary of all workers at a hotel while the hotel is being reconstructed. <sep><sep> When he got angry, he decided to go look for his fortune in the Lanpir Kamanber Mazer. <sep><sep> There, on the second day, people started to smile, applaud, enjoying our 'rally', sometimes our rallies even turn into dances. <sep><sep> If there is socialism in one country, if it faces a hostile ocean, what happened to Russia may happen to you. <sep><sep> The offensive that we are witnessing today is aimed at protecting the interests of the bourgeois at a different level, while also bringing about a rise in nationalist political parties. <sep><sep> This week, LALIT received a circular email stating that the All Mauritius Hindu Congress, a very communal right-wing party since 1964 until after Independence, is being reborn under the name "Mauritius Congress". <sep><sep> Mark Marie tales of how he literally lured a snake out of his trousers between Ville Noire and Ferney, it is a story where Amedee Darga borrowed a car. <sep><sep> Now, with the creation of a secretariat and the nomination of a secretary-general, bureaucracy is replacing spontaneity and creativity. <sep><sep> We must also realize that, whether in Mauritius, in Lezip, Tinizi, or Lalibi, all kinds of opposition to the Government exist. <sep><sep> Lastly: go support the poor families at The House to take action to find out where the weapons that Mohammed brought are. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Education for Workers competition was announced in its 5th Literary Competition, on the 8th of September, World Literacy Day. <sep><sep> CASE ZOLIVE: THE VILLAGE OF JAME'EN IN THE DISTRICT OF SALFIT - SUPPORTING A FARMER WITHOUT A FAMILY. <sep><sep> Your house was the only Palestinian house located on the right side of the Israeli settlement. <sep><sep>  Lamas' people do not have access to land to plant trees or do agriculture. <sep><sep> We will not go into the history of Workers or MMM chronologically. <sep><sep> - She had 2-3 representatives from her establishment (an intellectual, dialogue at the time: Dédé Maingard, Emile Series, Messrs Leclezio and Claude Noel). <sep><sep> This family society is well organized in the countryside and well integrated in the struggle against occupation, in the struggle against settlement. <sep><sep> We always publish our program: on different scales, sometimes, and in general, sometimes. <sep><sep>  forty people participated in the march from the camp to the gate. <sep><sep> and especially Israel wanting to make Palestinian life in the West Bank a true hell so that they leave their land and go to live as exiles elsewhere. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The question that arises is why are we continuing to use an inappropriate language in the education system, despite the catastrophic consequences as demonstrated by various studies? <sep><sep> Yesterday, if you look at the last 4 elections, you will see that it has happened, it is happening. <sep><sep> Otherwise, that goal would have the same "aura" as the ashes of its film. <sep><sep> But the question will always be what you want to answer it. <sep><sep> Hannah has given Palestinians cards from Hamoked (Center for the Defense of the Individual) found in Israel. <sep><sep> And in 2010, we resumed the LALIT REVIEWS, which reached number 95 last month. <sep><sep> To receive and provide information and ideas orally, in writing or printed, without any discrimination. <sep><sep> When negotiating an increase of 40%, when seeking negotiated solutions, you call yourself a "negotiator": by definition you are "negotiating". Give and take. <sep><sep> One thing that doesn't necessarily have a monetary value, you sell, for money. <sep><sep> But, the boss has continued to produce sugar cane and dishonor, the Government has continued to give it all infrastructure, Europe has extended its colonial framework. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a clear political agenda within companies to establish a foundation for 'social' in order to finance activities such as anti-drug campaigns, complementary schools for street children, and also to criticize the exploitation under the banner of "social". <sep><sep> A program, it can change, it must adapt, deepen, broaden, refine. That's what a program. <sep><sep> We all know that this Marine Protected Area, "so called", which we do not recognize, is a "Trojan Horse" hidden to deceive us. <sep><sep> Now Hurnam is filing lawsuits against the Minister of Health, former DPP, 2 police officers, and 2 individuals who have been convicted in the Grand Bois case. <sep><sep> But it results in a long fight, on a non-sectarian and national basis, on a political, educational and cultural terrain, combined with an assimilation of technical and pedagogical work on the language issue. <sep><sep> All children involved in the pilot process have greatly benefited from this experience. <sep><sep> And we have experienced this several times after the general elections in which we participated. <sep><sep> After revealing his illness, Paul Berenger has decided to return as the leader of only the MMM, and to hold the position of Leader of the Opposition again with Alan Ganoo. <sep><sep> He has situated this activity in the current political context of the country. <sep><sep> In the State of Law, we observed the incapacity of all parties, except LALIT, to face the crisis of capitalism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the assistance group, there were poor farmers, a group of craftsmen who organized their own transportation, planted vegetables and "mamb Lalit." <sep> <sep> There is a lot of pressure on this alliance, it seems impossible. <sep> <sep> Therefore, he wants to say that the historic grand capitalists, who have more managerial experience since the time of slavery and colonization, must continue this "good" management. <sep> <sep> And it is Paul Berenger, the Minister of External Affairs in the PT/MMM Alliance, who went to sign this Treaty in Cairo. <sep> <sep> When we were discussing this issue of language nationalization, and also a downturn in the working class, it forced us to reflect on our strategy. <sep> <sep> Mr. Minister, we would like to remind you that in 1994, the UN body, the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ECOSOC) in its report on Mauritius noted with concern that the Creole language. <sep> <sep> LALIT has raised its "litmus test," conducted a survey on the law to resist crisis - liberalization on one side, and law on the other side. <sep> <sep> In 2005, as part of the electoral campaign, we not only published a program against communalism and the Best Loser system (a 200-page reference book). <sep> <sep> They made all the old people suffer a language and humiliation when they abolished the Universal Elderly Pension right; at the same time they did not hesitate to continue to give exaggerated pensions as ministers and deputies. <sep> <sep> Its rearview mirror is a glass that fits into another, and that you pull out when you need it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The big political-economic-zeo transformation started to take shape from this year. <sep><sep> - Lalit proposes that there are 63 candidates elected on the basis of the first past the post system. <sep><sep> But a strategy must be devised to make the program a reality. <sep><sep> Luck after one stage, starts another stage, go on like this. <sep><sep> And now they are able to sell their pumpkins for Rs 24 each. <sep><sep> MSM and MMM while-while they are complaining and they are resorting to desperate protests with only one goal to make room for them in a future Coalition Government alongside PT. <sep><sep> by increasing the tax income of every person by every amount of money (even pensioners) by a percentage. <sep><sep> If he has 300 members, he schedules an appointment in the newspapers, he sends his appointment, in the assembly he will have 37 people come, he has no Quorum. <sep><sep> Long ago they were known for putting sweets from the other country in the pockets of the dictator Papa Doc and Kiba during the time of the dictator Batista, to ensure that the two peoples remain calm, not to criticize. <sep><sep> He cannot keep everything in his head at the same time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The State, when no social class can ensure its reign, is in crisis. <sep> <sep> Us, the common people, must remain calm there. <sep> <sep> At that time, the working class consciousness had matured, but its political consciousness was still "electoral". <sep> <sep> Together with its army, Israel has set up checkpoints, gates, barricades, and a surveillance system to control the movement of the Palestinian population inside their own territory. <sep> <sep> Julienne, many years later, where Bud recognized them and reminded them of their oath. <sep> <sep> Normally, the Eurozone should have been able to benefit from the crisis in the Dollar. <sep> <sep> Let us observe all these realities that are an integral part of the "economy", from a Marxist viewpoint: <sep> <sep> We will have Menwar, Daniella Bastien and Richard Beaugendre in discussions that are coming, to provide a musical dimension in our reflection, in our analysis, on this very topic. <sep> <sep> You are in a level where a 5-year-old child can master several languages as mother tongues of many countries. <sep> <sep> Berenger says "there should not be a communal reaction to the results." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He agreed to hold a conference, invited Chossudovsky, and gave a single lecture. 
<sep> The government has managed to force the Chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority to resign. 
<sep> When the burglars attacked them in their car, Timi was ready to fight back. 
<sep> The title suggests that Creole is already a medley, and this is being questioned. 
<sep> He has discussed with members of the MARON movement about the issue of Creole language, family violence, the organization of political activities, trade union work in Reunion and Mauritius. 
<sep> The government has been forced to amend this outdated anti-family law. 
<sep> Energy is affordable, and proper action to stabilize the climate will reduce the suffering caused by heatwaves. 
<sep> And it is the local capitalist class's interest that is the biggest obstacle to political unification in Mauritius. 
<sep> You are only looking at the inheritance, the vague reflections. 
<sep> Jean-Claude Bibi, a lawyer and former Minister of Justice, has chosen to address the philosophical side of this issue instead. 
 <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Tonight we need to check if there is enough drinking water in the refrigerator. <sep><sep> The tears shed guarantee a certain level of security. <sep><sep> After his seminar today, Lalit is putting in place an action plan for the year 2006. <sep><sep> So, what has been plotted in secret by the British, American, and Mauritian governments, is being exposed now. <sep><sep> Initially, he was collecting white sap until the day he realized he was wasting his time. <sep><sep> Or, is it necessary, from now on, to unite under LALIT to challenge the exploitation by the bosses who control the land, leases, banks, hotels, BPOs, and who reign through the constant protection of the PT, MSM, PMSD and MMM? <sep><sep> There is a Common Front Trade Union, which has reigned FSSC, and its seat is Unity House. <sep><sep> This general awareness of the role of finance capital, is a somewhat different conscience, more political. <sep><sep> This reminds us of the farcical ceremony where the Minister took an oath in the middle of the street in front of President Jugnauth and where Hassen Rojoa was missed by only Mami Klunn to complete the lineup. <sep><sep> Instead of one single person, the DPP in person, to sign the Certificate of Morality (with the launch of an NPF lighthouse in the building), now there will be 6-7 other officials allowed to sign. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a hidden agenda during which the "block" reigns. <sep> it means that there were necessary conditions for there to be a Bonapartist state. <sep> only with 40 poets, 40 different people came together. <sep> so his language is a unique and characteristic facet of a natural essence of his mind. <sep> when we see on television, hear on the radio, read in the newspaper, that the B-52s took off from an airstrip Diego Garcia, a territory that is part of the Mauritian territory according to our Constitution, went to bomb people in Bagdhad, went to save people in Afghanistan who are going to a wedding, my friend, we must realize that a hidden goal, it cannot but be under no control over people! <sep> And this despite the International Court of The Hague and the Supreme Court of Israel having condemned and demanded the dismantling of that mine. <sep> Moreover, people are reflecting on the fact that for many years, there have been more and more what could be called an "opposition" in Parliament, especially since all the parties in parliament have been working together in several consecutive governments since 1982. <sep> and in the popular mobilization of Septam 1980, where workers by the thousands in every village, every suburb wanted to know about their movement and were looking for clues every day in Creole to read, to know what is happening in other establishments and other sectors. <sep> they all said, "Yeah, we're in, let's give a hand", they said. <sep> 4th example, an issue that Lalit has contributed to keeping an eye on.. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that Plan Boolell is missing his backbone, meaning the agro-industry. <sep><sep> The introduction of the Creole language, as well as Bhojpuri being taught in Hindi classes, has become a real linguistic confrontation against the hegemony of foreign languages in Mauritius. <sep><sep> So how do you find that in the last 3 months, our activities have continued normally. <sep><sep> There needs to be a policy that builds scientific knowledge on knowledge and experience that planters, breeders, and fishermen have accumulated over a long period. <sep><sep> Is this a sign that the democratic rights we have today are threatened, will the police become more dominant. <sep><sep> For Diego, without coffee plantations, without seasoning, without TV Paloma, a boat carrying arrivals. <sep><sep> This government's decision to support the Palestinian people at a crucial moment represents a victory for LALIT and other people and organizations who are bringing peace in favor of the Palestinian people. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah will play several pieces of classical music by Grieg, Debussy, Bartok, a piece by Chopin with an introduction by Ti-Frer, plus Chopin's first Ballad, on a digital piano. <sep><sep> In practice, it is said that States must face their interests closer to when they borrow to repay their debt, and this in turn provokes a vicious circle. <sep><sep> There will be a demonstration today at 10 am (local time-Leypt), at the Egyptian Museum, but it seems that the Egyptian government is using repression to block this demonstration. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Capitalism has taken something that is not an object, it has made it into an object, it has objectified it. <sep><sep> The kitchen and the bathroom were detached and the toilet was away from the house in a corner in the backyard. <sep><sep> On Wednesday, October 17th, in the radio program Habib Mosaheb, there was an interesting debate on food security, in which Cyril Monty, agronomist, and Rajni Lallah, member of LALIT, were invited. <sep><sep> This is a measure that benefits both historical bourgeoisie and state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> It is important for us to grow, but not at any cost. <sep><sep> The MMM leader during the years 2005-8 seemed to have lost his political flair. <sep><sep> So, people who organize in the neighborhood committee often bring a class conscious awakening. <sep><sep> A good principle based on experience says that it should come after children have acquired literacy in their first language." <sep><sep> This conference departs from the Lalit party naturally in the context of an electoral campaign. <sep><sep> This Resolution in the United Nations General Assembly, in preparation, in turn, is for an international case against the British Government and the United States Government, in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The global capitalist system today is showing its flaws because it has no solution for the economic crisis and its economic system is part of the ecological crisis problem. <sep><sep> The big solar panels that were donated never got used. <sep><sep> In the village, there were signs that Balram had caused trouble. <sep><sep> Even those who were against him didn't know who would replace him for the general electoral reform. <sep><sep> When he wins, he easily wins his seat, L'Alliance Social doesn’t nominate. <sep><sep> One evening when he wasn't feeling well even though he had taken a sleeping pill, which normally made him drowsy, an extra idea, as if falling from the sky. <sep><sep> For an alternative economy in cane and rice, especially: <sep><sep> LALIT quickly took an anti-death penalty stance. <sep><sep> There was a focus on analyzing global migrations as well as the unstable political situation in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition, Paul Berenger, he, fails. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They asked for the implementation of a communal classification and a community-based strategy, not based on class, nor even on situation. <sep><sep> *In the political sphere: Finally, after a 10-year campaign (before JUSTICE and during JUSTICE), political parties (especially MMM and MSM) have abandoned their holier-than-thou stance to battle more openly, facing problems hands-on. <sep><sep> The rise of communalist, racist ideologies that weaken class consciousness crucial to international solidarity. <sep><sep> My decision to make mom and dad suffer, I know. <sep><sep> Is that it? Yes, Tamby was feeling a rhythmic pulse and everybody was responding eagerly. <sep><sep> This decision will make the Creole language an essential, optional choice. <sep><sep> And if ever it is forgotten, it will be remembered very quickly. <sep><sep> I suppose that it is partly because many historians who write history, who tell history, tell it from the perspective of the leaders. <sep><sep> It was on this basis that he had wanted to decriminalize abortion. <sep><sep> I have tried to cover everything in as concise a way as possible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In small industries and construction sites where they make satin, boat models, linen clothes, lace curtains, small restaurants, the workers are well-paid, sometimes even more than in big multinational companies or family businesses. <sep>

Even if he hides it more, an when, in a disaster, the Government announces that children with only 3 credits in SC can go back to school, enter HSC. <sep>

Talking about the French zone, looking at Lesid, looking at Granpor Savann, from the dual textile life, all have closed down. <sep>

And us, we are in a society where the class struggle is no longer as intense, just so that different classes ensure their own survival. <sep>

Mauritius is contesting the MPA and says it is incompatible with this Convention because England is not a river Reunion and only Mauritius can declare a marine park there. <sep>

True love is not about building barriers or circumventing them, it does not require the other to meet the criteria set by certain families or groups. <sep>

But, there are people who can walk on the road but do not participate in the Census. <sep>

It is clear that we must follow the changes that the trade union movement is going through, as a workers' class organization. <sep>

And as from the beginning of the 20th century, the intellectual elite emerged in Mauritius, conflicting with the local bourgeoisie known as the Oligarchy, establishment owners. <sep>

One of the current Marxist works is a review of Volumes II and III of "DAS KAPITAL" to find differences between notes in manuscript form left by Marx in big piles when he died and the editions edited and published by Engels later. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today we are in a systemic crisis, which arises in the economy. <sep> <sep> There was also Ram Seegobin, a medic from Lalit, who took care of their health during the hunger strike. <sep> <sep> But it is clearly wrong to presume that a Blue-Eyed Resani- man making a “community” call, is not part of the system, when that system is in the public domain, and anyone who can read can read it. <sep> <sep> We can also put some teaser announcements in a flexispeys on the website, for upcoming activities, or radio programs coming up. <sep> <sep> it is very difficult to bring it into a capitalist world where almost everyone par- tis private companies that lobby to prioritize their vested interests only for immediate profit. <sep> <sep> As the first line in the book says: We need to think big. <sep> <sep> But in the era of neo-liberalism, this kind of favoring is no longer called “nationalism” or “decolonization”. <sep> <sep> Can the public be made to pay to breathe on a beach? <sep> <sep> Today, M. Allet's party is just an official symbol of PMSD, but it has faded away. <sep> <sep> We share it in commissions, in branches, in our central committee, in our membership assembly, in political seminars, in strategic seminars like today, in all party structures. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In that situation, the Israeli army has bombed it multiple times, destroyed houses, hospitals, water sources, and schools. <sep><sep> When it reaches 8 in the morning, I will go to work as a doctor, I have finished 3 meetings, meetings for explanation. <sep><sep> This means the production of basic products like crops and the conversion of vegetable wastes. <sep><sep> You have to go wash it up, so it's not going to be equal because the Rupee, it's for him and you're trying to take it with him and he won't easily give it to you. <sep><sep> They also have easy access to the office of the Vice President of the USA, Dick Cheney, who has elaborated an energetic plan to satisfy the Enron company. <sep><sep> And we have those social security measures sometimes because, economically, the government cannot provide unemployment or make the employer give a minimum wage. <sep><sep> - Proposal of a "threshold" (a barrier) of 10% for a party to have representatives based on proportionality. <sep><sep> It is at that moment, where the police have arrested 2 women, Marie Louise Armoogum and Merline Lamb. <sep><sep> People are beginning to realize that this situation will worsen if we do not organize. <sep><sep> We also find it striking that the leaders of associations that fight for human rights, representatives of the working class organization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, you will find them hanging on the fence behind the school. <sep><sep> There were 2 major meetings: one in Tour Koenig and one in Phoenix. <sep><sep> This kind of work, for it to be useful and not be captured by either the bourgeoisie or the MMM or the PT, it needs to be independent from the State, the bourgeoisie, imperialism, and religion or organized communalism. <sep><sep> Your hammer and laser beam will build the Movement necessary to reinforce the unity of law and order. <sep><sep> Now, we will look mainly at this ultra-liberal option, some call it "monetarist", which Sithanen has chosen for his budget. <sep><sep> We have a production system, where there is capital and contributing capital. <sep><sep> Or is it because we are deluding ourselves, we are not talking with certain people, in the end, are we creating divisions among ourselves? <sep><sep> Martin King was standing with his civil rights. <sep><sep> Then there were our 2-months seminars, 2 political seminars. <sep><sep> The "Additional Stimulus Package" is not new, it is not a "re-orientation". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is confident in his primary electoral alliances and relies on a communal strategy, he is determined to succeed in gaining power. <sep><sep> The seminar theme is “class struggle” and “internationalism.” <sep><sep> What the PT-MSM-PMSD Government is doing in this last year and what it did in the previous 5 years, and what the MMM did in the previous 5 years, is using the same sectors that are in difficulty. <sep><sep> In democratic countries, the concept of "citizen" originates from the French Revolution. <sep><sep> For a press conference, next Friday, September 3rd, in Ramallah, Minister of Prisoners' Affairs Hisham Abdul Raziq (Palestinian Authority) will announce the results of negotiations within prisons. <sep><sep> The Historic Block helps us understand the political issues of this systemic crisis. <sep><sep> Ideology is more than a distortion of perception but rather a distortion that occurs in reality, an arrangement that brings about an alteration of reality. <sep><sep> Marx's theory encompasses events that happen due to what has happened before, but it also includes the potential for intervention by knowledge, and the knowledge that the lack of it can affect what happens. <sep><sep> It is emerging in a time where much progress has been made and where threats seem imminent. <sep><sep> Should the Cabinet be elected by the National Assembly? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If we find a market for our embroidery, will we not find a market for other things? <sep><sep> It started with the FMP, a political party, which came out of the FPU, then they merged with OMT to form PMT, and voila! <sep><sep> Followed by SAPs (structural adjustment programs) where capital finance was being exercised (ending subsidies to local industries, privatizing all services, devaluing currency, encouraging economy to invest outside, etc). <sep><sep> When oppressed society members have nothing to live on? <sep><sep> At the same time when reducing employment in the sugar industry, we need to change the Blueprint and VRS so that each worker gets a piece of land for diversified, collective planting. <sep><sep> Comrade Yannick says that they had a session on working conditions. <sep><sep> Food security is threatened, globally, and in a very drastic way, in our country. <sep><sep> All village and municipal inhabitants are being helped in this campaign. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin on Medical Testimonies in the case of Lamor Kaya". <sep><sep> The government needs to stop issuing permits that lead to the destruction of agricultural land, especially good land like Ebene, for building urban estates under IRS that are neither productive nor sustainable. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, the Jugnauth-Berenger-Ramgoolam government (they need to act as one, if you want to understand politics well) has allowed the expansion of the Mon Desert Alma refinery. <sep><sep> We have had two movie sessions, both about Che Guevara, this year. <sep><sep> And Mootee Ramdass, who has taken a brief break from the MMM, has entered the business world. <sep><sep> along with about 60 socio-political workers, some pro-MMM, some pro-Nuvo-Lisur, mostly pro-Lalit. <sep><sep> But it depended on all this mobilization beforehand, a mobilization that we did not know where it would lead us. <sep><sep> a total of 60 FSM candidates in the election, the press almost assumes that it doesn't exist. <sep><sep> As for all the other political parties, being funded by big benefactors, they defend the interests of their bosses. <sep><sep> So, the conflict between the Government-MSPA is ongoing, and it's good that the Government is not continuing to sit at the establishment table as it used to. <sep><sep> Finally, when the Government finds that there is too much mobilization going on, they decide to make the Zarden Company a restricted area. <sep><sep> Working contracts are "directly determined" to last for 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years. After that period, they end. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The last resort the MMM and its ally PMSD have is to resort to opposition for power. <sep><sep> Now, is anyone telling us what will happen after 2009? <sep><sep> Intellectual political work - which also involves knowledge of practical matters: <sep><sep> Where work becomes a creative and transformative activity - to enrich society as a whole and advance all members in society and to care for the environment and in society in general it becomes part of everyday life and a pleasure. <sep><sep> A great difficulty that young people face when they enter politics as LALIT advocates, is the societal pressure that comes with the engagement process. <sep><sep> They come with all kinds of solutions, all kinds of remedies, they come with all kinds of comprehensive measures, to challenge the capitalist system that is in crisis. <sep><sep> Why did ADSU end up failing in this other one? <sep><sep> They were getting just a taste of a social work. <sep><sep> This fault line that separates "social reality", on the one hand, from "political reality" and "economic decisions", Alain Ah-Vee has argued it represent an ideological failure that has been going on since 1980. <sep><sep> We need to look at the manner and the nature that trade unions have evolved, they have all become bureaucrats in their work, and also the attitude of workers has changed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Why did they allow the establishment of a closed mill and licensed artisan, instead of creating an agro-food industry? <sep><sep> Comrade Kreepalloo: A reflection and information to share. <sep><sep> There was a course in capitalist class that had an interest in agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> We took this position, which is an intermediary, necessitating a clear policy and only on the issue of governmental and para-state advertising fees. <sep><sep> They used part of Mauritius as a springboard to bomb the civilian population in Iraq and Afghanistan. <sep><sep> While the Minister of Family Rights is proposing microcredit for families. <sep><sep> It was a way to hold a meeting to start a lively debate that is currently taking place in the nuclear energy ecology course. <sep><sep> After this meeting, the European Law of Imin, after the same bananas, finally made its decision: <sep><sep> Jamouna always smiled every time he looked at the political leaders' antics. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, there have been a series of price hikes in December, starting from January. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The second concerned the question of "Stateless people" in Xinjiang, and its link to the issue of payment balances in America. <sep><sep> There are 2 new work laws in Bayonne, which have been in effect for about five classes of workers responding in proportion to gravity. <sep><sep> With the "forward base" plan in 1989, many people thought that finally making the Indian Ocean a Peace Zone would become a reality, with a military base closing in Chagos and returning to the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> He didn't waste his time and then wondered if there was something to quarrel about. <sep><sep> Now a new central element has entered: an element that was central to the Campaign, namely in 2003: ENERGY. <sep><sep> After studying sociology, before having his 2 children, he has almost completed his nursing degree. <sep><sep> Is there any visibility: where will he be in 6 months, perhaps 2 years, between work, home, and personal development? <sep><sep> However, Bidze, and capitalist aid in the financial section, is quite sufficient. <sep><sep> And no one can know when he will decide on the National Assembly. <sep><sep> That means that merchants who are present will Berenger implement extremism and delete the name of his party. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Anyone who wants to stand with us needs to strictly follow our rules, with our brands, let us know. <sep><sep> Today, everyone in the working class realizes that the Opposition is no longer present in Parliament. <sep><sep> All this, to say that even my "historic" service is used in two different ways. <sep><sep> We have been witnessing for a few weeks now a rather bad melodramatic movie played by different local political actors. <sep><sep> This is explained mainly by the fact that what most believes is his right to beat someone, like a father would say, lucky he has the right to his child, until beaten, because the parents. <sep><sep> An important observation: many people do not know enough about the conduct of the general elections to understand the best loser system. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said comrade Rajni Lallah will provide more details in his review of LALIT for 2011, which forms the political party's report. <sep><sep> A fool cannot assimilate what is happening in the world inside and outside them. <sep><sep> At the time of the Non-Aligned Movement, it was said to be a "new world economic order" and the issue of demilitarization was a fundamental issue in their fight. <sep><sep> Also, last year, when there was an enlargement of Lerop, from 15 members to 25 members, and many new members from their country. - good at farming, in the Deles Valley. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> -If people oppress each other politically, on the basis of a program, they will necessarily - according to bourgeois ideology. <sep><sep> This means that this decision will serve the European money to restrict the sugar industry to the point where it becomes a sugar factory because the government wants it. <sep><sep> He started to get interested in women's rights when he participated in a Summer Camp in 2002. <sep><sep> The government and the sugar industry barons have come up with their restructuring plan. <sep><sep> He rather comes and says, strongly, we wanted to get rid of this 24/7 thing. <sep><sep> We are not all agreed on the small fractures in the existing society, and we rely on what we find fantastic, where the actions we take can bring sanctions in society. <sep><sep> Sorry, I can't express myself perfectly by email, but here I have understood what Loryan is. <sep><sep> Today, because of official recognition, there are more people who want to learn to write Creole properly, according to a system. <sep><sep> And finally, we found that many of them, if not all, are financed by the bourgeoisie directly. <sep><sep> * The state is either guided by good "moral" or "only" ideas on how society should govern, or guided by "reason". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in retrospect, we find that we had Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Reagan in 1981, who took the lead in the world stage to implement a strict policy. <sep> It is important to say, it is not here, National Forum. <sep> He positioned himself against the Workers in 1948, then with his comrades in the Advance Group, took control of the Labour Party in the 50-60s. <sep> The class struggle that the PT and MMM have abandoned, we embody it in LALIT today. <sep> In Venezuela, there is an atmosphere where part of the population feels enthusiasm: at work, in the streets, in universities in Venezuela. <sep> With the large influx of migrants in England, British workers and workers in the United States have shown solidarity by sending ships with tools for workers in regions like Lancashire. <sep> The Councils walk in a democratic way, and some are against Chavez in some points. <sep> The Government is slow to move forward with a "resettlement" plan for the Chagos for Mauritians who are also Chagossians, and to organize a ship for Chagossians. <sep> Later on, these companies have also invested a lot of capital that has been produced by workers in Mauritius, in the security industry in other countries like Mozambique, Tanzania, and Cote d'Ivoire, and sometimes they have misused all this capital. <sep> Many employers take advantage of an illegal strike to close their business without having to pay any compensation allowance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He became a personal collaborator to the Prime Minister, special advisor to the Minister of Finance and Economic Development. <sep><sep> The Minister of Tourism has chosen this year's theme "Kreolite: Le Réveil" for the festival that will take place. <sep><sep> to show their gratitude, so that the GWF federation can continue with strength. <sep><sep> We believe it is important to debate what we call "the divide". <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Lalit announced a mobilization campaign on economic issues, especially employment. <sep><sep> They had to because the situation was almost critical. <sep><sep> And we are proposing a simple mechanism that will raise the educational level, through "raising the bar". <sep><sep> Karann, in shock, watched them closely as a butterfly played with honey and bees. <sep><sep> a) The salary compensation that was once a year, is now allowing workers to cope with all price increases. <sep><sep> Employers did not have a figure to propose, it was in the negotiation instead. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like how vegetables used to be planted - how do we cultivate happiness. <sep> <sep> They say, "Our prices are very Mauritian", there is a Mauritianism in the price of the item! <sep> <sep> Another characteristic of a good 'god', and the one that some people would have been very happy to have, is that he never dies. <sep> <sep> This means literally that your life will be dedicated to a class that you would call "nobility", that is to say, the aristocrats, the kings, all the nobles. <sep> <sep> For all recruitments, employers would have to publish vacancies, meaning all applicants with the most qualifications, and when they decide on someone to work, they would also publish that list. <sep> <sep> In the 25-30 years, there has been an exemplary installation of neoliberal ideology, an offensive that started by thinking through Hayek-Friedman, then through IMF-World Bank and eventually WTO. <sep> <sep> What goes along with this title is that all Chagossians have the right to return to their land, in the context of a reunified Republic of Mauritius. <sep> <sep> *When Jugnauth-Berenger came into power, Cehl Meeah was arrested, tortured, and imprisoned for 3 years. <sep> <sep> Without knowing where their children will work. <sep> <sep> So, with the fracture in society in the community - in history, a racial battle of Independence has been so serious. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Scientists in the field of pure science are in conflict with social scientists, academics in sociology, in economics, and in anthropology. <sep> <sep> In the USA, when there was the SWP (Socialist Workers' Party), a fairly strong party, it completely disappeared in the 1980s. <sep> <sep> Here, I would have liked to comment on the City Power issue. <sep> <sep> Therefore, we do not agree with the boycott on L'Express. <sep> <sep> Request for a strike under Ut 79, which Alain has promised in detail in his introduction speech, that is recognition for union. <sep> <sep> This means that in the future we no longer need to resort to forced labour. <sep> <sep> This convention which the States, whether federal or government, ratified in 1990, ensures that the rights of all children to education are respected, and that all children are free to choose. <sep> <sep> And if we work in the public sector, it is the same. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen said that Lalit is making a double call, a "mutual call": a call to the Prime Minister for a Gokhool plan. <sep> <sep> But she did not specify if it is necessary to end with the Best Loser system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Carol Benson said that she was monolingual, Anglophone, and learned her native language in America where she grew up. <sep><sep> And commentators, academics, economists, politicians mainstream, journalists, even those more complex, are beginning to accept that not everything is correct with the capitalist system. <sep><sep> So what about the other GWF unions, when we have our meetings, where they have decided that SILU and UASI together with OUA will trigger a strike in the security industry on very urgent demands. <sep><sep> Tuesday evening on the new MBC TV, people have been greatly pleased to witness the tirade that candidate Lalit has made. <sep><sep> Today, with the aim of strengthening his position in the GWF, Ashok Subron is organizing for UBIW to present a motion of thanks for the tremendous work that Ashok Subron has done as a counselor/educator. <sep><sep> The people in the union, if he signs a form, the boss transfers his money, give it to the union army. <sep><sep> The government, more than ever, is becoming a capitalist government. <sep><sep> There is a situation from the return of Lalit de Klas which says "When economic crisis is coming, working class with proletarian ideology. <sep><sep> As usual, LALIT has analyzed Bidze, has produced a communiqué. <sep><sep> But, will we then say that these women who need to be heard have brought about a girl, her family has dominated and oppressed black people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often the protagonists of "Mauritianism" advertise a special sixth category (in the communal framework) called 'Mauritian' and these are, they say, people who are 'not common'. <sep> What was interesting in the campaign, however, was not interesting in terms of the score. <sep> Workers used to feel dependent on their colleagues who were abusing them. <sep> and also begin to sell "that" (like the Mafia sells that) as "assets" as it did with houses in the USA. <sep> Althusser (2) went further to show that ideology exists in material form in the social practices of institutions such as schools, religion, and family that shape people through programs that are not visibly concrete. <sep> His father used to say that he was a 'dinosaur', a big-headed person. <sep> Surely, the Registrar will write their details, then you can laugh at them. <sep> The Playgroup Association (founded in 1975) and the Playgroup Federation (founded in 1979), are associations that unite parents, trainees at the grassroots and continued courses for Playgroup members. <sep> M.Allet and E.Guimbeau have never gone along with the repeated speeches that Deerpalsing, Sayed Hossen, Jeetah, David have come and are bringing the traditional bourgeoisie with the blessing of N.Ramgoolam. <sep> For the first time, they recalled how often it was women who were walking ahead, especially when the habit was at the initiative of the males. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> The Hague International Court of Justice (ICJ) was called upon to facilitate the completion of the decolonization process in Mauritius through a reunification of the Mauritian territories. <sep><sep> The Indians, who sent their money abroad, did not pass it by Mauritius, so that they also managed to arrive without paying tax in England. <sep><sep> People still remembered the colonial era; they also used to watch 'Nouvo Zom' (a TV show). <sep><sep> There was no overtime to boost the economy, to avoid wastage. <sep><sep> Jim Cummins, Dr. Carol Benson, Prof. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas (who recently gave a public lecture in Mauritius), Dr. Kathleen Heugh on the issue of mother tongue and its importance in developing abstract thinking in a child. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, another pipe layer was fixing Martin King. <sep><sep> Without wasting time, they had caught Princess Prathna's army and had started to run. <sep><sep> And yet, one must work, one must understand, if one is truly interested in defending the interests of workers for this accepted demand. <sep><sep> Throughout the year, we have met with activists from other countries. <sep><sep> In the general election, our candidates refused to classify themselves in front of the State, for this Beztloser system, a colonial apartheid leftover. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As a "trust" is being set up by each country to offer to large private sector companies based in other countries. <sep> <sep> We have a lot of experience here, on the international level. <sep> <sep> We will continue to work towards unity and strengthening the working class in this crisis period and at the same time denounce the bureaucratic trade unions working according to the bourgeoisie's agenda. <sep> <sep> And our detailed analysis of the bourgeoisie, it always functions well to explain the reality of Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Resistance has led a campaign for 7 years after they resigned from LALIT, it has resurfaced after the 2010 elections, as if they were back on track. <sep> <sep> The USS McFaul destroyer fires Tomahawk missiles. Since 2001, this destroyer has already attacked Afghanistan. <sep> <sep> We have a programmatic weight, and we have a lot of strategic analyses, but we lack militant means. <sep> <sep> Because sometimes capitalists and their politicians, they agree at certain moments to sit on certain demands so that they don't lose everything, so they don't lose more. <sep> <sep> And this has made the MMM collapse like a force for sanctions. <sep> <sep> Until now, 60% of the energy is already produced by IPPs using coal and gas, which is part of the plan for the restructuring of the Energy Industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is also pressure from the World Bank, which is strongly pushing towards privatization of all public sectors. <sep><sep> Instead of going to the beach as people usually do, instead of hanging out at home, we decided to put our heads together. <sep><sep> However, it provides a reason for the presence of police in a private place. <sep><sep> The representative of the youth group in the central committee (Kim Ng) agreed with this suspension, a suspension that had become inevitable because it was no longer possible to recruit new youth in a space where there were so many problems. <sep><sep> Bunwaree and the Labour government's Employment Rights Bill not at all seen to bring more rights to workers. <sep><sep> LALIT also has a strong position on this. <sep><sep> It has also described the various currents of unionism that express different ideologies: reformist current, anarcho-syndicalist current, "Luddite" current and revolutionary current. <sep><sep> Even when we decided it in a meeting in the Imakile Circle, we walked to the Company Garden. <sep><sep> And this goal in the workers' class can have a great importance. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie class has it, the workers' class has it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Stock Exchange is dominated by these types of transactions today. <sep><sep> In fact, according to Fukuyama’s, however, he has explained that he was responding to Marx, Engels, and other Marxists. <sep><sep> However, he is only 1% - as the "Occupy Wall St" movement says - and the other classes are 99%.) <sep><sep> what guarantees the profits of the security company by destroying 20,000 jobs through VRS and Centralization, giving the engineering company (MSPA) a monopoly on refined refinery exploitation. <sep><sep> And even if they don't know that the guard belong personally, the guard is challenging, accusing of beating and also of smashing his camera, then another guard goes to see a lawyer, to tell him, "Let everything fall." <sep><sep> It does not propose a law imposing a time limit, it does not propose a legal quota. <sep><sep> This happened after the members of the United Front of Swadizan Gos brought a very strong and inappropriate campaign against LALIT during the 1987 General Elections: <sep><sep> The bourgeois political parties find the strategy based on "electoral strategy" to become "opposition". <sep><sep> But, it is not how a movement is built. That means, it is a cold answer, in times of unity difficulties. <sep><sep> - Tim, slavery has been abolished! Therefore, apart from all that you give him, he needs an apology. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Against taxes, against privatization, against pressure from the IMF to increase water and electricity prices, pressure to eliminate subsidies on rice, flour and gas, pressure on the pension system. <sep><sep> There is a mobilization in Albion by the inhabitants of this region against CT Power to implant its plant, from a MMM base, led by Fabiano Balisson, etc, who are leading an environmental movement against the CT Power project. <sep><sep> Personally, I believe that Professor Juggessur has become the director of MRC and it is quite interesting. <sep><sep> Using this money, in the case of a laid-off worker, so that in the first 3 months, he/she continues to receive 90% of the salary he/she was receiving, but this time he/she receives it with a pension fund, the Solidarity Fund. <sep><sep> Then you will notice, just like the Labour Party organized itself in 1936, when it arrived, it also had its goal, its class enemy, the secure oligarchy, the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> According to the last 5 years of the MMM, it was mainly the Weekend newspaper that could have put political pressure on the New Militant, and the New Militant could have been downgraded to a newsletter! <sep><sep> Indeed we can say that there is a protest based on environmental issues (due to carbon production, it is really polluting). <sep><sep> Pending - There has been an internal conflict within the government on this issue. <sep><sep> Other lands are being converted into IRS and RES projects, meaning "real estate." <sep><sep> Today, the issue of "worker participation in the enterprise" is being brought up again. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Will we continue to have a policy that relies on fragile sectors like the French Zone, ICT/BPO, tourism and the diaspora?<sep><sep> After 16 months in the Social Alliance, the leaders of the PMSD have decided to shake up their bags.<sep><sep> - Samazeste, because his heart is good, he didn't want to tell them that the woman was pregnant. <sep><sep> Why do you behave like a victim when someone accuses you and says they are being beaten? <sep><sep> The Jugnauth regimes have another peculiarity, they tend to focus more on the islands. <sep><sep> - The end of private land expropriation in favor of agricultural land by private sectors, moving toward democratic control of land, the sea, rivers, lakes and ponds. <sep><sep> 10 He made changes to the Constitution to safeguard political power. <sep><sep> There is evidence of repression (after they have succeeded in the Mauritian education system, despite the limited system). <sep><sep> His relationship with the Missus is very important during the crisis. <sep><sep> Participation where worker representatives sit on boards, or participation in action or participation in management, they are only a facade of democracy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Lalit, we are proud that among our candidates, there are many workers from the working class. <sep><sep> And note that the Labour Party has been almost continuously in power from 1950 to the present day. <sep><sep> Dear: There, I'm looking up at my mountain - meaning I can't look at your hands, where we are - but I would like to say that in these issues, in these comments. <sep><sep> Then Lindsey Collen coordinated the start of the planning campaign. <sep><sep> For anyone who comes forward, each comes for their own reasons, to make a difference? <sep><sep> But the sea does not always break on the reef? <sep><sep> For the past year, Lalit has sent a reply to the Chagos issue to all international organizations and individuals within its support network. <sep><sep> Current situation: Is reconciliation possible between the factions in Lalit? <sep><sep> Sometimes it is necessary to set aside malice in order to let life move forward and embark on new beginnings. <sep><sep> For it is “People themselves who erase borders, by drawing on a map. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And, because the working class movement has been weakened (by having its place of work in Lokesidan, by repression on all levels, and by losing its ideological basis). <sep> <sep> America guards Israel as its policeman in the Middle East to secure its oil sources. <sep> <sep> In his own family, in his own home to the children of generations of tenants, in his neighborhood in Casernes, Curepipe, where all the children called him "Mademoiselle Paule" with affection. <sep> <sep> For this reason, LPT has been able to unite artists, academics, all kinds of different people together in our universe. <sep> <sep> But, because there was this blockade, that militant group that was about to become LALIT, which later became Lalit de Klas. <sep> <sep> So all these indicators are very clear, at each point, we have an education system that has given very good, mediocre results, in many cases. <sep> <sep> There is also the role of SAJ as President of the Republic who is using his position to support MSM. <sep> <sep> So, we need a program for an alternative economy. <sep> <sep> The only fundamental difference between MMM and Labour is. <sep> <sep> Sometimes, we see it only as the working class that brings the struggle against the bosses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is work PRAESA, where two members of the Education for Working Group (Alain Ah-Vee and Rada Kistnasamy) have followed its TOTSA program (TRAINING OF TRAINERS in mother tongue education in South Africa). <sep><sep> Very soon, it was clear that the boy needed to change his attitude. <sep><sep> Another reality that people need to know in the world. <sep><sep> Since 10 years everyone knew that in January 2005, there will be a quota system to produce textiles, and that there will be "threats from outside the country". <sep><sep> Yesterday, this was not the first study on the crisis in the Euro Zone that the government has done. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam is going to UNESCO, Paris during the UNESCO Executive Council meeting from September 30 to October 17, according to the UNESCO Committee on September 25 (2008/62). <sep><sep> The case has also been raised against multinational Halliburton, US Attorney General and De Chazal du Mee, a Mauritian company in a time when the only one recruiting under the name of the company was not Arthur Andersen Worldwide. <sep><sep> Bestluzer System (BLS) Where do MMM and PTr stand on the Best Loser System (BLS)? <sep><sep> Even today, in the Supreme Court, there is another repressive case. <sep><sep> We would have been surprised when Ashok Subron announced that his union campaign would start "in the office of Shakeel Mohamed", spreading the rumor that it would provide strong support in the new "cannery industry". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, for this current crisis, they have another strategy. <sep> On the contrary, Mr. Duval himself claimed that the importation of cars had increased by more than 30% in the first 9 months of this year. <sep> The government may not have a backup plan for the security industry, it may let it die. <sep> This means, as you may notice, during the general election campaign, the press felt obliged, in its coercive role, to criticize Lalit. <sep> It's difficult to categorically say "we must never give up looking for a cure" and it's also difficult to categorically say "we can give up being vigilant." <sep> The girl, Nilou, whose name was different from all of yours. <sep> Among the LALIT delegation, there were 2 members, Alain Ah-Vee and Ragini Kistnasamy, who had already gone to Palestine to witness life on the ground and participate in demonstrations against the Israeli government. <sep> This is Tara, a nationalist boss, Kentucky Fried Chicken, built this multinational US, while another one behind, Courts, yes, is all-pavilion Mauritius, this is "I love Mauritius", who is that? <sep> Houses, respiration stations, and other infrastructures that have not yet been reconstructed. <sep> So in ordinary language, we find a much broader and more exact definition of what the State really is. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We may not be able to field a candidate, but we will still campaign for. <sep><sep> Many people have been marked as-av by the violence of the investigating team. <sep><sep> When MMM breaks, and MSM joins in, the establishment says "Most of us support MMM," and workers have sided with MSM. <sep><sep> When Marx visited a village or a family, he said we are a producer of literature, but we are also a producer of history. <sep><sep> This is also a topic that we will discuss in our congress. <sep><sep> There is work to be done, there is a fight to bring about the reunification of the territories of the Republic of Mauritius, to complete this decolonization process. <sep><sep> When he congratulated LPT for the 2004 UNESCO World Prize, Cassam Uteem said in an ironic way, "Nul est prophet dans son pei". <sep><sep> Both this paper is for Bidze, but in relation to the solutions that Sithanen is proposing for the economic and social crisis in which we find ourselves. <sep><sep> True renewable energy development that does not depend on carbon and the waste that keeps our prisoners in the establishment and its factory. <sep><sep> Ti-Planter, who often was a big part of the Workers' Party in each village and popular neighborhood. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The energy crisis is closely linked to the food crisis because a part of the cereal production sector began to be used to produce biofuels for running vehicles, instead of being used to feed people. <sep><sep> The Ministry of Finance needs to give importance to all ministries concerned with these studies and implement them. <sep><sep> According to reports from conference participants and an article in the Mauritius Times from 27 May to 2 June 2011, no concrete steps have been taken since that conference. <sep><sep> We are not interested in getting involved in union disputes like that. <sep><sep> In 5 teams, the women finished second, and in 4 teams, the women finished third. <sep><sep> Another topic on which we have been quite active is decolonization. <sep><sep> Working-class families are often happier with a grassroots and populist movement, finding it entertaining compared to the other options. <sep><sep> The dynamic is that parents and their children prefer choosing unexpected colleges so that there are more chances of getting jobs after Form 6. <sep><sep> We have developed community work together with Sant Goomany, Grup Zenn Phoenix, CTSP, and we have developed a protocol for working with former President Cassam Uteem (who has since focused politically on the issue of Palestine). <sep><sep> He also spoke about the International Workers of the World's international experience. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Early in the morning, Mrs. Koulall, her husband, when he went to work, found me on the beach without knowing. <sep><sep> The reporter said that we do not believe that Zizman International Law, the United Nations General Assembly vote, will not change anything. <sep><sep> This would mean that when there is a decrease in production during a cyclical crisis, when there is a percentage of workers who are laid off, then there are expenses that continue, and this stimulates the economy. <sep><sep> We find that there is no consideration for the working class when an employer finds that he is no longer making as much profit and stops his leasing. <sep><sep> However, when MMM, when it comes to power, it has no excuses. <sep><sep> On Saturday even bus drivers ask boys students to go down otherwise all students block the Beit Iba Bridge and the army will not let them pass. <sep><sep> In fact, a great tragedy has happened, and is happening. <sep><sep> In our service, a girl from Nablus University studying for Arabic-English translation tells how she will learn in such conditions. <sep><sep> I asked them what they thought and they asked me to accept because then I could defend them better. <sep><sep> Most people consider "democratization" a good thing: but have the working class realized that Navin Ramgoolam is talking about democratization of the capitalist economy? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Self-criticism: when food security is no longer a priority, we have not acted quickly enough to re-launch the nutrition campaign. <sep><sep> If you want to get involved in the mobilization campaign, it's easy: You can ask us what kind of help you can provide! <sep><sep> - Several writers/journalists in Creole: Pushpa Lallah (stories, essays), Alain Romaine (non-fiction book), Daniella Police (The Greens). <sep><sep> The observation we have made during these 4 years shows that our website has seen a significant increase in the number of visitors since 2002 till today, with a considerable growth in site traffic. <sep><sep> So, the articulation of these three forces is what drives the revolution. <sep><sep> The regime left Reunion Island by the FAZSOI, Armed Forces of the Southern Indian Ocean Zone. <sep><sep> The April amendment has also made it illegal for the first time for a worker to be put on strike. <sep><sep> And resistance has reached a stage of opposition to police violence, not just lamenting its excesses. <sep><sep> It is so serious that it discriminates against more than 90% of children. <sep><sep> Their surname determines where they stand in society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is currently a lot of corruption in the government, so the data will expose this corruption. <sep><sep> Similarly, they went to see him on March 25th to understand what happened. <sep><sep> Their land was giving them good yields. <sep><sep> In the World Creole Language Education Day, Workers' Chronicle conference held a press conference on Tuesday, October 21, 2003 to announce the launch of its 5th literary competition. <sep><sep> From 4-5 bananas, we are celebrating Labor Day in this serious context, in the context of a serious crisis, especially a global economic crisis. <sep><sep> LALIT has denounced this reactionary measure by Bidze Jugnauth-Berenger. <sep><sep> R&A continue to campaign for their candidates without classification. <sep><sep> So, it's their tactic, but I don't agree with it. <sep><sep> The following speech is a transcription of an excellent presentation by Barrister Jean-Claude Bibi at LALIT's recent "School of Cards" held at the GRNW building. <sep><sep> What Paul Berenger was proposing then was to replace the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace prize with a Nuclear-Free Indian Ocean Zone prize, while nuclear disarmament is part of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace process. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the beginning of the year, we had our membership seminar, we had the LALIT Assembly in January, we organized 2 regional seminars (one in April in Forest-Side, and one in Ziyet, Grand Rivyer). <sep><sep> Today we are continuing to face challenging working conditions for all workers from other countries, and working conditions in the textile sector in general. <sep><sep> Then, for some reason, the union cannot meet this challenge. <sep><sep> It is defensive in the sense that it says "don't all do exams," "Don't do such things" This is only defending. <sep><sep> In Curepipe Midlands, the vote will be the best, getting 2 blocks, then 3 Lalit. <sep><sep> * On the mark we passed an industrial complex Barquan Industrial Zone near Ariel settlement which has about 80 licenses. <sep><sep> Israel has also begun conducting nuclear tests secretly in the Indian Ocean, near Sri Lanka. <sep><sep> The Advance newspaper, a PTr organ, has exposed the MCB case, possibly in the same type to show that bourgeoisie, even, and its representatives involved in scandals, not just government representatives. <sep><sep> So, there is a reason why in 1982, much more radical than today, we left in 1982, formed the LALIT party. <sep><sep> Now, the government is proceeding with an amendment to the Reform Institutions Act in that sense. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in ICT, etc, he takes new note in a new sector, so no great experience in trade union activity in that sector, no great experience in movements, nor in grievances. <sep><sep> This becomes a big problem when we seek a solution - likewise. <sep><sep> And in this sector, it starts to merge with other sectors. <sep><sep> Many members of the union also strive in Trade Education. <sep><sep> There are 82 teachers trained by the MIE who are teaching in Creole. <sep><sep> I'm tired, lower your voice, I want to sleep! Let's get through this night together, until the dawn. <sep><sep> We need supplies for canning, for dry-freezing, for packaging and exporting, for other auxiliary industries. <sep><sep> This means being based on a program as opposed to automatic allegiance to the country. <sep><sep> Every country in the Eurozone has the same currency. <sep><sep> During this period where capitalism faces these 3 challenges, the capitalist system has shown its failure. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He does not hinder himself, because the number of people necessary to start a new union, there is no reason for fragmentation. <sep> <sep> But this debate that is taking place on the issue of employment, the debate on what should be done, depends on demand for majority rule, it is something that happens every day. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, LALIT together with several organizations, have adopted the Resolution of Grande Riviere on these 3 demands, after an International Conference organized by LALIT for 3 days. <sep> <sep> He was not looking for a good place in the chaos but rather he was thinking that the chaos itself needed to disappear; <sep> <sep> This event has taken on another dimension with implications in several areas, including Philippe Forget who was Number 2 at MCB, who ran for Blok 104, and who is now Director of the La Sentinelle group, namely the flagship of L’Express. <sep> <sep> At the beginning of his penitential quarantine, the Governor's enlightened mind led him into despair and confusion. <sep> <sep> he recommended in his report that Mauritius should take necessary measures to publish educational materials especially for children in vernacular languages, namely Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep> <sep> If you look at countries where industrialization has been very successful, like Great Britain, there, industrialization has produced a large labor force and there has been quite a good union development. <sep> <sep> and Rodrigues has also started to embark on a journey to develop and learn from LPT pedagogy to integrate pedagogical techniques in their classrooms in different schools. <sep> <sep> This means that in the near future, St Mary's will become part of the same "Mixed Abilities" concept that already exists in BEC schools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Government with the Minister of Finance, Pravind Jugnauth, Berenger, Prime Minister, that is 2 parties, MMM and MSM. <sep><sep> There has been less mobilization in the working class, your salary is very low, work has become precarious, all of this has contributed to bringing about this downturn. <sep><sep> This historic event has been described in Revi Lalit de Klas, and has become the best piece of Mauritian theater, Tras, by Henri Favory. <sep><sep> The Lalit activist who was chosen to run as a candidate in No. 3 is Ally Hosenbokus, 28 years old, a provocative professor and Lalit activist for the past 5 years. <sep><sep> All this indicates that LALIT is positioning itself for 2013 to face a very interesting period, where we must strengthen ourselves to give ourselves the capacity to respond in a very serious situation for the working class. <sep><sep> Whether you become a queen or a king in England or become the head of the Anglican Church, you become the guarantor of relationships. <sep><sep> This means that even democratic rights, in a democratic system, are at risk, through the law, it is necessary. <sep><sep> These leaders do not know by what democratic process they have come to such a position, but the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois state are satisfied that it is like this in this crisis period. <sep><sep> Lasin and possibly Lenn prefer MSM in government. <sep><sep> He never asked Sami for a divorce to marry him because he didn't want the child to suffer because the adults had a problem. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This mobilization is necessary not just during election time but it needs to be done in a permanent way. <sep><sep> Hasn't the time come when we need to focus on sugarcane plantation and production of essences? <sep><sep> Even a nation, 104 nations, or 20 who have participated in this sermon on behalf of the 104, where it is asserted solely that it is true, how the best loser will continue the battle, his way of walking will still be there, his way of moving will still be there, he will continue it. <sep><sep> The struggle that every nation brings against exploitation, the struggle that the oppressed class collectively brings, is a constant struggle. <sep><sep> By deploying its network and its private army, it crushes all resistance from the working class, and other forms of resistance as well. <sep><sep> What we, we observe, in these speeches, the demands being made, these are LALIT demands, that for many years, we have been including in our political program. <sep><sep> If you know that what you are doing and what you need to do in the future, 'carry on'. - 'How will you know?' - 'Listen to your heart, Ram. <sep><sep> So, how to organize a strike during a Dictatorship? <sep><sep> its professional activities in the IT sector, systematically offering personal sympathy to individual members for their problems and personal weaknesses. <sep><sep> He had lost a lot of blood; the doctor said he was near death. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These two experts, Avril Joffe and Justin O'Connor, work within the framework of a UNESCO convention for the protection and promotion of cultural expression diversity. <sep><sep> At that time, on Moka Street, we are receiving reports from all the establishments in the area on how things are unfolding. <sep><sep> For Rosemay, there is a sense of school and lessons because she couldn't know where to leave the two children while she was working. <sep><sep> For the Israel Court of Justice to listen to their defense against the State of Israel, these families must hire a lawyer in Israel. <sep><sep> It hasn't reached its climax yet, we are still waiting. <sep><sep> Showing the city of Baltimore in the state of Zini, where production has finished, and a company is in decline. <sep><sep> And it is urging the State to act, in the face of the epidemic, in a way that poses a threat to the health of the population. <sep><sep> They are used to picking olives in Israel as a job. <sep><sep> I am not making them sad, they 'are not making me sad either. <sep><sep> A second-class quality of first-class leisure: you can have an individual first-class leisure but at the same time, it does not make any difference individually to anyone else. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The reactionary mobilization to maintain the Best Loser system continues to take to the streets, and prominent individuals like Lawyer Gulbul, University Professor I. Koodooruth, and Elizier Francois. <sep><sep> Even though these demonstrations are not overly politicized, they have not reached their goal. <sep><sep> And very quickly turns into a fight between defeat and defeat. <sep><sep> The cutthroat competition, even though it is a Commonwealth country, but it was already included, and Britain did not accept jurisdiction. <sep><sep> We have to decide together on the land we have, what to produce. <sep><sep> He says, "To survive, I won't fill those empty posts with my relatives when these 5 workers retire." <sep><sep> Inside the system, where you can be like a slave selling a part of the soul, its courage, a wage slave. <sep><sep> Then, this opening provided for many debates on strategy. <sep><sep> Facing a government that has emerged on a program of "putting people first", we cannot just say "Let's force it, the working class takes power". <sep><sep> The supply ship could not come to Mauritius because of the blockade. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I pick up my child - my 3-month-old baby - not knowing where to go. <sep><sep> He invites me to discuss the Lalit's reaction to the Private Radio proposals to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. <sep><sep> According to him, there was a turnaround in Lend politics from the late 90s when "two locks were opened": the Ajodya Mosque and the Indian market. <sep><sep> We launched our campaign for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> And the PT and MSM, when they make concessions, they have relied on socio-cultural (especially Indian, but also Creole and others) to smooth their historical block when it falters. <sep><sep> I can summarize the Pelindaba Protocol, its three protocols, where we can situate, what was launched, the strength we need to mobilize to eventually agree to have a key with the African Union to demand inspectors on the Chagos, on Diego. <sep><sep> When we look at the destruction of part of the core at that time, it shows how it was not easy. <sep><sep> BLS for "death of a natural death," he then asserted. <sep><sep> For example, if we take 2 glasses physically, as these 2 glasses are shared, and we add another one that is out there, it's a matter. <sep><sep> He wants to organize a small celebration to mark your success. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "Next, we will give you a Bridging loan from the Central Bank." Boolell is handling the finances well. <sep><sep> And, it was during a LALIT Branch meeting in Bambous in 1999, that it was proposed for families in LALIT to visit Mrs. Vev Veronique Topize who lived in Beau Songe with Kaya when Kaya died, as a family, to support her in facing what she would have to do. <sep><sep> When there is no marché to go to, and there is a possibility of going to another agricultural produce, we need to plant. <sep><sep> When Nann is fed up, she prefers to retreat behind her newspaper. <sep><sep> Later on, when his wife, Aziza, became the Supreme Judge, she made the decision to stop pleading in court, give some consultations, offer three lectures and dedicate most of her time to writing, her true passion. <sep><sep> 90% of people can work with us in mind and spirit, we are progressing in ways that will save the planet. <sep><sep> Are the theories, concepts like 'Mauritianism', 'nationalism' appropriate tools today to combat these imperialistic forces. <sep><sep> At a deeper level, look at the extent of political corruption: <sep><sep> Where the revolution was relatively successful, it tended to take on a "Stalinist" form of government. <sep><sep> or alternatively, refusing to reorganize their corporates to switch production of food into all their fields, vegetable and new sugarcane. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritius Sanatan Darma Federation has managed to promote its goal in a dangerous manner, in this dynamic community. <sep><sep> Therefore, truly, in the absence of a political agenda, (now that you are reflecting on whether you will act collectively or disband) we realize that the only factor holding this group together is the end. <sep><sep> In the first council meeting, there was a tense atmosphere that could have turned as thin as Kraft cheese. <sep><sep> His sorrow and tears were taking over his life. <sep><sep> After training, participants will receive a certificate of attendance or a completion certificate when completing an assignment. <sep><sep> Permission must be given to cultivate the land on the condition that the entity uses its existing infrastructure (buildings, roads, electricity, water supply, telecommunications network) and invest in agro-industry. <sep><sep> And Bush has decreed that the Mauritius country will host the Forum in January 2003. <sep><sep> A program that takes into account the level of consciousness among workers and the way they act based on demands that create a dynamic yet revolutionary incentive. <sep><sep> And when Paul Berenger, when he was Prime Minister, threatened to leave the Commonwealth, Tony Blair then immediately expelled his United Nations ambassador to exclude all cases as "former Commonwealth members". <sep><sep> Today, only when the electoral campaign is launched this Wednesday, LALIT is organizing a protest against the British government's plan to threaten the establishment of a Marine Park in the Chagos and Diego regions to continue the illegal occupation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Marx examines this labor courage that is not found here, such as electricity, he looks at the way this, he alienates himself. <sep><sep> The government must use the State so as not to give permits or encourage economic activities that degrade agricultural land. <sep><sep> Our demands are clear to create dynamics against this type of sanction. <sep><sep> The Gaza Freedom March was to break the silence on Gaza. <sep><sep> During the campaign, when this blackout was almost total on the radio as well, we made a formal complaint in front of the IBA Tribunal, and only then did the radios lift their embargo a bit from the bilateral agreements with Lalit. <sep><sep> But it raises the question of whether the Church has credibility to proclaim that it protects innocent lives when it was responsible for the inquisition. <sep><sep> when in fact they do not own anything that is a means of production (neither a factory, nor a hotel, nor a bank, nor a textile mill). <sep><sep> What we do with our land is crystal clear. <sep><sep> We find that the class struggle - Marx did not invent it, but rather had it, between oppressors and oppressed, in different forms, in different contexts. <sep><sep> They have all believed and always believed that a workshop that develops through unionism automatically strengthens political unity against the capitalist system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They were filled with a boutiquier mentality that is only about counting money, they were broken. <sep><sep> He is saying that your position is a personal position. <sep><sep> This kind of demand can create jobs in the country, not go blindly into work as capitalism has done until now. <sep><sep> We need to find multiple solutions that are adapted to the current crisis. <sep><sep> He can go directly to the hospital where there is a mobilization for him to receive medical care, psychological care, preventive treatment so that he does not get infected, so he does not contract AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. <sep><sep> This 'Economic Democratization' at Work is simply a historical bourgeoisie that shares its economic control with another bourgeoisie that relies heavily on government support. <sep><sep> We have a duty to be vigilant now when we read newspapers, watch TV. <sep><sep> Everyone was nurturing their talents, which were nurturing their people and at the same time, together, they were making progress in creation, as if they were giving God a helping hand to make life better. <sep><sep> They are calling for a return to communality in human handling to lead to anti-capitalist ideas. <sep><sep> Lalit sent a letter of protest to the Prime Minister against the presence of this French regime, and this was done in conjunction with a leafleting campaign focused mainly in Port Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite the fact that the government, from last year to the beginning of April, there was a How movement platform. <sep><sep> It is unacceptable because I say it is a betrayal, it is a lack of respect because when we negotiated we negotiated like equal partners. <sep><sep> Specifically, there is a group working on the field of gender terminology, that is sharing different theories on writing scientific, technological, technical texts in African languages. <sep><sep> And when we talk about internationalism, one of its facets is the class struggle at an international level. <sep><sep> When the Chinese government decides to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, they are sabotaging the process of offering more security to all forms of life that exist on our planet today and that will exist in the future. <sep><sep> Goethe, for example, the way in which he raised these material things with so much calm and superiority. <sep><sep> When a triumphalist system begins to have failures, starts to crack, starts to collapse, people are forced to ask themselves questions. <sep><sep> People are beginning to question the role of financial capital. <sep><sep> There was no money to pay the workers. <sep><sep> For several years, a series of factories where unemployed workers have closed their doors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We favor an economic policy that will no longer keep our prisoners in poverty because of goods. <sep> PT – Ramgoolam has favored making the Bestluzer comminal fonn ("subsume") system in Proportional Representation as Sithanen has proposed; <sep> It reflects the international aspect of this phenomenon and this location. <sep> It shows in a quite drastic way how the bourgeoisie are no longer too powerful. <sep> The debate forum will be chaired by Laval Yves, with speaker Lindsey Collen. <sep> And the boss had developed a culture where any union worker who claimed, the boss was saying, "No, can't pay," then that went to the NRB committee. <sep> Yesterday, through this loophole, it is impossible to explain the same revolutionary sanctions in the past, it's not just what's in the future. <sep> After school, even the fact they should take a break where big gates can make you decide to cry. <sep> He spoke about the need to conduct a boycott campaign against Israeli products like the boycott campaign against apartheid. <sep> And this outspoken politician, does he support his opposition proposals in the country? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Cindy also felt lonely in a context where there is some SIDS. <sep><sep> Despite seeking our votes, we who work to survive, then she reigns in capitalist interests. <sep><sep> The BPO sector presented as a new “pillar” segment of the economy that the PT-MSM-PMSD government and the MMM-MSM government were before it began. <sep><sep> What is particular about this domination is the fact that Okinawa was subjected to Siberian domination from imperial Japan before (it was a kingdom then). <sep><sep> And it is a big challenge for the various contradictions. <sep><sep> Even if they want to unite, they are not in a position to unify, and they certainly are not in a position to propose anything for the working class. <sep><sep> What is the right time to hold the meeting; the way the meeting is organized, the terms of language used in the meeting, the terms of behavior that everyone has in the meeting. <sep><sep> The Alliance for the Future was formed from an anti-constitutional role that the President of the Republic had. <sep><sep> At the same time, it provokes and tells to enforce the fundamental law like the MPL did. <sep><sep> But since the law passed, political coalitions and politicians have been smiling behind closed doors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like Marx, Engels, and Lenin wrote about the state, they were also engaged in the socialist movement. <sep> Tuesday all workers of Anex Palmir found work, but no worker from Anex Yemen came to work; everyone stayed home. <sep> The delivery was supposed to come, and sometimes it would arrive late at night which made him nervous. <sep> We have our Program, which we have been developing since 2005: on the economy, on ecology, on education. <sep> Rajni Lallah replied that it is the Israeli state that is committing illegal occupation. <sep> In our electoral campaign, we always kept an eye on unfair politics. <sep> This went unnoticed in the Road Map. <sep> So, let's bring down all those who are wallowing in corruption. <sep> What deserves attention, is given a more prominent place in an inequality that is unquestionable. <sep> He conducted an analysis on medical evidence in the case of the Kaya death. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are publishing the SART in full and explaining the organization that has signed it. <sep><sep> When we take a lunch break, LALIT has organized a food donation for everyone, whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian. <sep><sep> Berenger is calling for a "free vote" on a separate bill on the Best Loser System, and he has made 4 proposals for BLS, but without specifying if he will vote for any of them. <sep><sep> Yesterday, Pravind Jugnauth was almost at breaking point. <sep><sep> It is a mode of production that is subversive, a production that does not take environmental considerations into account. <sep><sep> Previously, many thought that the Earth had only 2,500 bananas. <sep><sep> The government has been and continues to give importance to these sectors. <sep><sep> * We must oppose all new "rounds" of the WTO and not resume old WTO negotiations until a "World-wide Social Audit" is conducted. <sep><sep> Finally, the move that Paul Berenger initiated in 1990, which led to the Pelindaba Treaty, has legitimized military bases on Diego Garcia without any nuclear activities by the US. <sep><sep> Lindsey criticized the way the MSM-MMM alliance has represented the historical bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, the United Kingdom has agreed to give to the State of Seychelles some of the land and sea that it acquired through illegal annexation of Mauritian territories and illegal displacement of Chagossian people. <sep><sep> He says it is more difficult to impose a language that young children do not yet fully understand (or that some young children understand to some extent) to teach them concepts. <sep><sep> This Mauritian Creole-English dictionary is a collective work that lacks a significant presence of Creole language in the electronic world. <sep><sep> Today, it is on this point that Barack Obama launched his victory speech. <sep><sep> The detachment of Diego Garcia was part of an armament transaction between the United Kingdom and the Indian Ocean Region. <sep><sep> The Sri Lankan armed forces are supported by the United States, China, Pakistan, India and Israel. <sep><sep> As socially-funded organizations also experience a crisis. <sep><sep> There is a great mobilization of young people, students in Chile, Quebec, by thousands of young people on the streets, because the physical university courses are increasing. <sep><sep> However, Europe faces a difficult time to come out of this crisis. <sep><sep> Then they will have a place in their new “historical bloc” that will be difficult to challenge the old one. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He and another member of LALIT Bambous for example, campaigned in a completely new way: they brought a small truck with the LALIT program. <sep><sep> Under all this pressure, he lost his children and returned to Mexico with nothing. <sep><sep> On an organizational level, there are at least 5 different unions representing transport workers, and this fragmentation weakens serious development in terms of a strategy that would enable transport workers to face the challenges towards full employment in this sector. <sep><sep> As a result, where there is an advantage for Bérenger is that they have given him a "pardon", or rather a "relative pardon". <sep><sep> So, this limitation that favors the working class, at the same time limits the power of bureaucracy and restricts the number of bureaucrats. <sep><sep> The sun was setting, the stars were shining brighter and it was moving slowly to allow the three of us to follow it. <sep><sep> In 2008, as GWF-FPU- FTU join NTUC to form a new CSG confederation, the government is advancing with its ERUs and ERIs. <sep><sep> What we can say now is that there has been an overwhelming presence of "corruption" during successive elections. <sep><sep> - The repression of the mother tongue in associational life is a symbol of a more generalized repression against the mother tongue. <sep><sep> after Allende was overthrown in a coup in 1973. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the PMSD congress, there was a major vote against a certain proposal. <sep><sep> We had a working class, whose strength was based on the security industry, with 55,000 workers and 100 years of union experience. <sep><sep> Whereas the MMM party did not intervene until later. <sep><sep> Response: There are two factions - there is Lalit on one side, and there are people who have resigned from Lalit on the other. <sep><sep> 1,000 marchers are expected to gather in Cairo, Egypt, on December 27, 2009. <sep><sep> Lawyer Ramloll has shown him a copy of the deposition he likely made, and asked him not to sign it. <sep><sep> If 7 municipalities replace 5 District Councils, he found he could gain control over most of them. <sep><sep> It is important how we analyze it, and link it with other issues like the environment, anti-imperialism, anti-criminalism, and especially Lalit for socialism. <sep><sep> There were 30 mothers present (aged 18 and up). <sep><sep> This conference started yesterday and is uniting for the first time anti-war and anti-military base organizations from 40 countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is another WTO rule called TRIPS, which concerns patents and "anti-piracy" measures. <sep><sep> Minister Boolell, in his speech, demonstrated how after there was so much effort in the bilateral dialogue between the British Government and the Mauritian Government, the British Government chose to "betray the Mauritius government" on the issue of the Chagos: <sep><sep> When Mauritius withdrew its motion at the UN in 1990, some people said there was a need to preserve peace in the Western Zone and Industrial Security to justify Mauritius' withdrawal of its motion at the UN in 1990. <sep><sep> This was a conscious, collective decision, even if it was on a small scale like this. <sep><sep> It had to put itself on its feet, $14 billion. <sep><sep> All 9 treaties are at a dangerous level, 3 have already passed the point of no return. <sep><sep> Lalit agrees that all children have the right to an education at an equal level. <sep><sep> So, when he meets Lalit de Klas as a founding member in 1976, he brought that experience, that knowledge, that wealth of experience, into our party. <sep><sep> The present family has also studied the different ways in which the State has classified the Mauritian people throughout history, and how it has changed, depending on the need to divide the nation at any given time. <sep><sep> The way forward is to first rally support among African nations and other allies in the former Non-Aligned Movement, and even the Commonwealth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Those who interpret the law only in terms of these basic elements. <sep><sep> The same questions were asked at a training session on IPP central in the rural area, such as CTDS that operates 100% with carbon. <sep><sep> However, in capitalist society, it is treated the same as you would treat a mirror, a savior, a simulacrum. <sep><sep> This means that when there is work, you work, when there is no work, you "rest" as the gentleman usually says. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, during the Ashok Jugnauth election, he failed before the Supreme Court due to irregularities and electoral fraud. <sep><sep> The problem in practice that arises in the political arena when implementing a transitional program of change. <sep><sep> They have noticed that there is a special attention to the presentation of the work. <sep><sep> I have come to understand that the demand for support is particularly high because this family is an activist family and often faces problems and tears. <sep><sep> And this is the modern political party that offers this possibility. <sep><sep> This could create an impression that we are not facing this situation, and that this situation is progressing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The action taken by the government of workers is to abolish the TCSB. <sep><sep> It strongly implicates Yousouf Mohamed and his 2 sons. <sep><sep> But the way we are going, year after year the real wages of worker may increase even faster. <sep><sep> So, towards the end of the 19th century, there was what was called at the time a "death toll" where estates sold marginal land to planters, to provide sugarcane for ethanol production. <sep><sep> Sometimes in the alley, we propose something in a meeting, and everyone says, “No, that's ideological, that.” <sep><sep> Actually, not only in agriculture, but also in BPO, there is a new class of technocrats that has emerged since the demise of the family-owned plantation, capitalist. <sep><sep> In most cases, naturally, Ashok Subron hasn't been able to convince them. <sep><sep> I would like to thank LALIT for giving me and Ally the opportunity to intervene in their workshop Etat de Lye, which is very interesting and where we are learning a lot. <sep><sep> Fascism is associated with this desperate attempt to "put things right". <sep><sep> On the other hand, some scientists are finding that the danger is much greater than the public thought. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Marx, Engels, and other revolutionaries started in 1864 when in Paris there was a large meeting called Expo Iniversel where workers from all parts of Europe were visiting. <sep><sep> But instead of cultivating the forest, the inhabitants thought that God had given them the forest as a gift to embellish their huts. <sep><sep> There were also discussions on various topics such as labor laws, the root of languages, capitalism and socialism, why the sea levels rise and fall and other actual reality. <sep><sep> On Timi's seventieth birthday in Samy, he gave his mother a large bouquet of seasonal flowers that Timi had decided to put on Balram's tomb. <sep><sep> Or there is a certain interest for all to be calm, to be calm, maybe he is getting a little desert with the boss, maybe he is getting a trip to go to trance, now if he goes to mobilize, everyone will lose in this game. <sep><sep> But, what to do with this compensation, it is also not clear at all. <sep><sep> Everything with the aim to go and register a case in front of the LaHaye Court (ICJ) so that they issue an 'advisory opinion' on the Chagos issue. <sep><sep> All writers, poets, singers, artists who have already and continue to create in Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> Anyway, they ignore the whole Manifesto that has already emerged from Mauritius. <sep><sep> This is because Mauritius has a history where society as a whole is involved in the textile and sugar industry, and is suffering drought. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Opening on Paper Ram Seegobin, on May 1, 2012, on the question of Class Consciousness during the Strategy Seminar, GRNW. <sep><sep> 1. We have, for a brief moment, written to Mgr Piat, the Deputy Minister, about the pressure that some were exerting to change the leadership of AKM. <sep><sep> He told how a Literacy Course student had even published two novels in Creole. <sep><sep> This is why in our title we put emphasis on "the party", meaning a political organization such as LALIT. <sep><sep> Of these, 16 out of 19 made abject and absurd "confessions" before they admitted being "guilty" and were executed. <sep><sep> But, what is important when looking at all these experiences, especially in the light of the world crises, is that one should not too quickly decree such and such a place as "a success" or "a failure". <sep><sep> - Good morning everyone! Good morning, namaste, good morning, peace be upon you! Despite my social upbringing, despite my B.A. (Hons) ... <sep><sep> But, when you trigger such a strike, you have to finish preparing yourself, psychologically, prepare yourself mentally. <sep><sep> Meaning there should be another phrase again on learning by heart without understanding, on getting out of the room before your classmate, and on social mobility, a family on a child's bed. <sep><sep> Group A4 Participation This year, there were artists and groups from 10 countries represented, a record participation according to the organizers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - 'Not really ... but ... that's life.' - 'Can I help you?' Kamini asked. <sep><sep> Nandini Bhautoo-Dewnarain, has approached the fact that literary creation in English is quite rare among former colonies. <sep><sep> The third flight was on the ropes of young people organized in a faction in reality, and even if they have real power that young people have influence on their faction and on political life in general. <sep><sep> Last year we found this recurring in the newspapers. <sep><sep> So, when Paul Berenger was overseeing the operation of shooting all the arrows against Cehl Meeah just before the Partial Elections in Number 7, at that time he was also overseeing operations against Lalit activists. <sep><sep> "We are preparing a balance sheet for the strict LALIT strikers," he said, "because we have just held a Member Assembly, where we had a discussion of the party, central contents and an analysis of the political situation in the country. <sep><sep> Since then a twist of fate has changed his fate, by creating new things. <sep><sep> The aspiring actress crook did not walk to become a model. <sep><sep> Then the boss presents his arguments why it shouldn't be given. Only then unfolds this way. <sep><sep> So, essentially, if there is a court, and if you do not start acting crazy, what alliances will they (if there are any) make after Parliament has ended. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At 10:00 pm, we reached the village to go home. <sep> Pleasure island food products rise and double are stopping and reducing their exports so they prevent shortages and increase prices on their own national market; <sep> The working class must not fall into such a mobilization. <sep> But we all, to the tune of tens of thousands every time we distribute leaflets, several times a year on 35 years. <sep> Everyone has worked, alongside the Branch and regional. <sep> The same way re-counting bourgeois parties that bring the situation where, after elections, people will say: 'Turn around, election come, election gone, same pro-capitalist politics.' <sep> Workers' education has opened the LALIT website article based on what LPT President, Alain Ah-Vee, said in his speech for the “LPT Balance Sheet” 2011, which was given to LPT members on 28th January 2012. <sep> Under the Labor government's bill, the number of local will increase from 14 to 20 and the number of socks will decrease from 21 to 15. <sep> This resolution coincides with a historic turn: forty-seven years after the creation of the United Nations and forty-four years after its Resolution 181 to partition Palestine, which was under British mandate. <sep> CSG seems to have entered a crisis, no longer able to function. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One day, more than fifty million bananas fell out, as soon as it began to rain, to separate the muddy soils in several continents to allow many creatures on land to enjoy the pleasure of the sea. <sep>
<sep> In the following week, Ragini Kistnasamy organized a screening of John Pilger's film, Stealing a Nation, followed by a discussion on the film. <sep>
<sep> The second reason we find is that there is a tendency, especially in the last 10 years, to make elections a battle between 2 alliances in which there are what people call major and minor parties, which formed like 2 blocks. <sep>
<sep> In the IRA, there was a very precise definition, JNP when there are several parties recognized, they negotiate as a Joint Panel. <sep>
<sep> However, where the State has a particular problem is the USA because there is a financial law that sets a limit. <sep>
<sep> No right to talk. All people in the education system know that to date, in the majority of schools including those with special programs for Creole languages, there are measures and very strict controls against the mother tongue. <sep>
<sep> In the film, what is striking is the 3 guys who manage to cross a large river with their Citroen Deux Chevaux, which had no papers because it was not born as a lottery but as parts. <sep>
<sep> In Lalibi, the battle between the Gadaafists and Anti-Gadaafists continues. <sep>
<sep> In the sugar industry, there are many seasonal workers, as in agricultural diversification as well. <sep>
<sep> If we had to organize a fleet together with the Bancoult comrades in 2004. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, an agronomist discovered that there is a cycle that ends. <sep><sep> The right to appeal for more compensation to succeed must come when we can unite all the forces that can force the State, China and Britain respectively: that is precisely the global anti-militarism movement. <sep><sep> Where traditionally there has been no progress, it means that this is essentially political opportunism via electoral repression, initiating a true debate on the situation, and preventing political progress. <sep><sep> Because often, when it is no longer useful, it knows what is coming. <sep><sep> Pressure must be increased on Israel to stop illegal occupation and colonization of Palestine as well as to lift the blockade on Gaza. <sep><sep> The communalist and casteist campaigns that the Labour Party and MMM-MSM are conducting, as well as the electoral corruption that the Bérenger government is engaging in through all sorts of bribery, will not bring progress for people in constituencies. <sep><sep> Former Prime Minister, P. Berenger, said earlier, "Best loser for a natural death". <sep><sep> For the International Congress in February, we had a good mobilization. <sep><sep> After 9/11, the Pakistani state was forced to support the "war on terror" organized by the US, with the US making it clear that "either you support us, or we bombard you". <sep><sep> Communal organizations have increased their power marketing by the regime and Parliamentary Opposition. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Their economy is closely dependent on and almost entirely relies on the economy of Israel. The services provided by Israel are funded with money from taxes on all boats that pass through the sea to Gaza and for all products that enter Palestine. <sep><sep> As a result, the more money you have, the more power you have. <sep><sep> Among these eleven resignations, there are at least six who have been relatively inactive since the beginning of 2004. <sep><sep> The treaty has been in force since last year and the end of this 125th country will become a member of AFCONE (African Commission on Nuclear Energy) with its headquarters in South Africa. <sep><sep> There is also a need for modern equipment and modern equipment at all work sites. <sep><sep> So, as I have mentioned in Lalyans for the Future, there are already problems for the Chinese. <sep><sep> Potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, peas, corn, sunflowers, corn, all will benefit greatly. <sep><sep> This blend of problems is due to too much carbon in the atmosphere because of electricity and other things. <sep><sep> When we realize that instead of having Jean-Claude de L'Estrac as President of the Republic (representing the interests of one section of capital), we have Anerood Jugnauth representing another. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin in FCSOU 4 times, every year. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To ensure that they are part of a "you": we do not look at anyone as different sizes, we do not look at anyone in an isolated way. <sep>
<sep> In LALIT, for a long time, we have been predicting this kind of disaster. <sep>
<sep> Everyone noticed three men and a fair girl who was a bit confused. <sep>
<sep> The language situation that the State has favored and in which we have evolved has led to a creative expansion of people's lamas. <sep>
<sep> Lenin had explained well how, despite the ideological domination by the bourgeoisie over the working class, working class sections, through their life experiences, their own awakening. <sep>
<sep> Then, when these 2 sides come, we start running, the muddy army moves at the right time, the stick is shaking, towards Mr. Serz's Fergisson. <sep>
<sep> But according to them, Lindsey is to blame for all this. <sep>
<sep> They did not want the family to do the work, but for this there was a price to pay. <sep>
<sep> Saying, "Don't hit me, sir", But the trade union movement is not in the habit of responding to this offensive against the workers by way of a counter-attack All people who watch football know that the best defense is attack. <sep>
<sep> So there was an "ethos" where an elite was reproduced without competition. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are like illusions: they are a appearance that, when you approach them, they move further away. <sep><sep> And this extraordinary phenomenon, what has it brought to combat colonialism? <sep><sep> For us, participation in the Fight for Freedom is a rare privilege. <sep><sep> We have enough credibility among the people to be an influential force. <sep><sep> But there is another kind of fight that is in the trade union struggle. <sep><sep> When looking closely, in the history of Mauritius, in the times when people attributed blame, misery. <sep><sep> In addition, the testimony from Cadet Couyava about his entire life in opposition to the Medine boss, and the solidarity he benefited from after the boss kicked him out and tried to get him out of his house. <sep><sep> This session was the first session in 2009 in this series of "political education" every 15 days starting in 2008 following the resolution of the Lalit Congress in February 2008. <sep><sep> His second child named Ganga was special. <sep><sep> Similarly, the company Andersen has been implicated in discriminating against Chagossians in recruitment for a private company based in Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, what LALIT has managed to do is to allow the MMM and the MSM to find excuses for their failure to work, forgetting their positions on the law regulating the relationship between employers and trade unions. <sep>
<sep> From then on, this publication was 100% in phonetic Creole. <sep>
<sep> Skutnabb Kangass (2000) has presented evidence showing that when the mother tongue is not used in education, it leads to negative results. <sep>
<sep> Even the corrupt organizations controlled the space and what shocked Timi was that the central political power was aware but seemed to ignore it because the corrupt were financing elections and providing politicians with large sums of money. <sep>
<sep> There was a decisive battle in Santa Clara to prevent gangs from entering to obtain weapons. <sep>
<sep> I heard that the Minister of the Environment was considering imposing a tax on noise pollution, but his adviser warned him to be careful because his proposal of a personal tax would become too much. <sep>
<sep> So LALIT, in its place, invited other candidates to become counselors in a regional administration that is not addressing the real issues of the inhabitants. <sep>
<sep> This is important, especially since our Conference is looking for ways to bring LALIT forward. <sep>
<sep> Legal advice must be sought before conducting an investigation. <sep>
<sep> The Government system we have, the State we have, is encouraging plantation abandonment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After the general election results, and in the context of comments by communist Paul Berenger, the number of disfavorable votes has multiplied immensely. <sep><sep> Organizations like the ones found worldwide are also sending messages that will last this century. <sep><sep> And continue to see sugarcane and pineapple production as the primary activity in the agricultural sector. <sep><sep> On the issue of defending private property, when the president resigned he said there should be a referendum. <sep><sep> However, we found a well-dressed group in the area who came for the environment. <sep><sep> The Social Alliance has threatened various communal organizations and individuals (VOH, Mario Flore, Goolfee, just to name a few). <sep><sep> In the French language, it still exists, even in modern times. <sep><sep> When everyone was having fun, hearts were happy, and the louder Bandouk got, the more trouble he caused. <sep><sep> It becomes clear that if you want the destitute to continue to die, to continue to get sick, to continue to go to hospital, to continue to get the police after you. <sep><sep> Peace is not enough, so workers come to the office early in the morning, they have a briefcase and bring merchandise to sell inside. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we thought that the British was here for good, there were bilateral negotiations, we said that sovereignty issues, resettlement issues, human rights issues, all need to be discussed through what we call bilateral negotiations. <sep> <sep> When we have to analyze the progress that JUSTICE has made since we started coming together to set up our Association, there is a key element in there. <sep> <sep> The current crisis is the MMM and MSM and its UN, when it is not true, because these parties have the same policies and they are the ones who have started this process that has brought the working class into these difficulties today. <sep> <sep> Have you found credible proposals for the creation of massive stable employment, for inflation control, for deepening democracy, for removing communalism from our electoral system. <sep> <sep> Editorial this number is on the cover of the sugar industry. <sep> <sep> The view from another angle, he makes it ethanol, puts it in the oven. <sep> <sep> We had agreed to go 30-30, then leave Nomination Day, we wait for them to support the MMM. <sep> <sep> There was already a problem in the time of the French Revolution and I will try to identify the problem that still exists today, with this concept of "citizen". <sep> <sep> When making these demands, when bringing this kind of quality of life, there are also demands that, even their collective, even their conscience, they are also wrong at the same time. <sep> <sep> -Neville Alexander, from South Africa (took the floor on socialism in times of economic crisis). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> UNESCO, African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) are promoting the use of mother tongue as a medium of instruction in schools. <sep><sep> Often, it is not easy to go beyond the "syndical" mentality, but in the teachers' working committee, they are starting an initiative to overcome the limits of traditional unions. <sep><sep> All workers have the right to take part in local decision-making in a way that benefits them. <sep><sep> Now people will better understand when we say: here is the social class represented by Sithanen/Boolell and Nita Deerpalsin/Sayed Hossen/Jeetah on one side, here is the social class MMM represents, and here is the social class LALIT represents. <sep><sep> This morning we have heard the testimony of Mrs. Edna Menes, she has described our situation very accurately. <sep><sep> (At that time immigration agreements had only been suspended 25 years before, so the terminology "Indian" and "Indo-Mauritian" were more accurate than today.). <sep><sep> The crisis in the Eurozone has had ripple effects and caused many problems, starting in Europe. <sep><sep> It takes time, it is difficult, but it is the only valid option. <sep><sep> on our petition on slavery that has clearly influenced the Truth and Justice Commission; <sep><sep> Firstly, there have been 2 demonstrations in the last 2 weeks. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A road permit, for example a time of one thousand rupees per banana, is all that is needed. <sep> This "swing" here seems to be common in the country, but the amplitude of the swing is much greater in the countryside. <sep> It also means that all villages had representation in the institution that ensures the entire District. <sep> The government must utilize existing infrastructure (such as schools) for mass education and training on areas such as plantations and farming (with scientific input). <sep> Recently, the bus drivers have been able to negotiate and reach new checkpoints that Huwara Farm has closed. <sep> In regions where Jamouna had remained reclusive was between Dr. Ram, our candidate, and Mr. Robert, their candidate. <sep> Rajni Lallah and Cindy Clelie visited South Africa on behalf of LALIT to participate in a conference on "Alternative Economy" in South Africa. <sep> To bring knowledge from Mauritius on local life, to help us organize demonstrations here, to force the government to change its policy towards Israel. <sep> This will be like a new beginning here, but in a different way. <sep> This will help children in rural areas to attend school, and they will learn to read / write, and become multilingual in an "additive" manner. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Working conditions in diversification need to become as equal as in sugar! <sep><sep> This is your primary objective, and it is also subjective for shareholders. <sep><sep> 9) WHO HAS THE POSSIBILITY TO HELP A COUNTRY GET OUT OF A POSITIVE CRISIS? <sep><sep> 5. Those who hold power (in the workplace, in politics, etc.) do they not have the duty to be very vigilant and watch over their behavior? <sep><sep> Minister Soodhun threatens: if the Sentosa workers do not renounce the union leader Atma Shanto, he will revoke their work permit and make them leave the country. <sep><sep> This value in money, we need to technically call it "invaluable value". <sep><sep> In Curepipe, for example, where there have been more resignations from the urban and regional branches in Curepipe/Lesid, work has improved, now there are 3 branches in Curepipe that are functioning and a new branch in Rose Belle. <sep><sep> (b) Where the book, documents, or records have been kept in a language other than English and French, cause such book, documents. <sep><sep> We propose a delegation consisting of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition, the Regional Administration Minister, and a Chagossian delegation. <sep><sep> Some are saying that the army is taking aerial photos, while others say that Israel is preparing to attack Gaza. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>But they are investing money in fuel prices, how much will it be next year? Our society has become what is known as capitalism together, speculative capitalism. <sep><sep>At this event, Alain Ah-Vee and Ragini Kistnasamy, who were in solidarity with Palestine in 2004, also participated in the debate. <sep><sep>They share this responsibility together with the leaders of communal-religious organizations and sectors. <sep><sep>At first he contacted his own superiors Cyril Cheerfully, but soon he understood that the Yerasik church spirit had been paralyzed by its own history, a history dominated by Euro-Kreolity, by reactionary positions when it was necessary to take a position on the abolition of slavery, on the emancipation of Endo-Kreol slave employees, on the deepening of democracy, on the development of a Jericho culture, on the translation of the Bible, on the need to recognize children's rights, on the creation of new rituals more adapted to reality. <sep><sep>This value, it is directly linked, not necessarily totally, with the amount of work force involved, the amount of what we call in Creole with as much precision "courage" that is involved. <sep><sep>What role do the UK, France, Europe, the US play in the second World War and their responsibility in the rise of anti-Semitism which led to the Holocaust? <sep><sep>LALIT has continued to maintain links with different groups in this system in England, France, Australia, South Africa, America, and Reunion. <sep><sep>And once again, when the Government passed this law, it was clear that it was a law designed to reduce production and introduce what they called "flexibility in labor laws". <sep><sep>LALIT has made more documents, meetings, and discussions than ever before regarding these new labor and industrial laws. <sep><sep>Interference is a factor of diglossia in Creole language because it seeks to adopt French language connotations in Creole, which creates an insecurity in the Creole language which therefore did not exist. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Among the nobles, especially those belonging to the upper class, there were many who distrusted him because he had just come out of a majoritarian caste, the same caste that manufactured the Prime Ministers and they knew the ties that existed between the two were based on caste solidarity. <sep><sep> There is a possibility that a group of people will gain control over a stake. <sep><sep> There are three main factors concerning this energy crisis in the world that is exacerbating the systemic crisis that already exists in the capitalist system of Mauritius. <sep><sep> It explains why Ramgoolam called Subron on his cellphone, and they made a special Joint Venture to get 20% instead of 16% increase for workers and artisans, and to signal the PWU's role in the Historical Bloc. <sep><sep> People should not be subjected to a form of racism that pins everyone down to a single dimension, an ethnic dimension. <sep><sep> When we allow the Bank of Mauritius to enter into derivatives, and we open up the Stock Exchange to derivatives, it also complicates things. <sep><sep> This means we should start using the mother tongue to teach children various subjects (such as science, mathematics, history, geography, ICT, Art, Health Education, Physical Education). <sep><sep> What every government does to encourage a revolution is sacred, what they do not do, it passes as a nuisance: I enjoy watching this spectacle, where I understand every photo that appears; <sep><sep> It felt like he had found his father when he was in Leralsea. <sep><sep> "Trespas" this, because we have to go through a pitfall. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mrs. Thatcher knew that if you take any worker, isolate him, make him vote, "Can we go on strike," it is in favor of the employer. <sep><sep> There are many demolition and construction works going on, before this Phase De La, and it involves that. <sep><sep> They focus on making a career in French, so that anyone can integrate well into existing society. <sep><sep> Despite Independence since 1968, everyone speaks the language (92%, at least, speaks Creole and Bhojpuri) is still, until today, strictly prohibited: in Parliament, as the Registrar of Associations, in the Supreme Court, in certain areas of the Civil Service, in schools. <sep><sep> In the past, the bourgeoisie - the time of ordinary capitalist - as a class, there was no real political process. <sep><sep> They preferred a life where they had to give up their ideals based on love and freedom. <sep><sep> The alternative plan for DWC workers, now with subsidies for the Fitness Test. <sep><sep> What is needed today is a true opposition movement to defend the interests of the working class, planters, youth, and all poor people. <sep><sep> The conference exposed the divisions among different Chagossian groups. <sep><sep> Not to mention what charges the police are pursuing against them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The crisis that has unfolded since the crash in the tourism industry, which has crippled the Mauritian economy for more than 200 years, and has been aggravated by a "historic blockade" that is shaking. <sep> and where socio-cultural societies are active in politics and the economy. <sep> We understand that this "State" is responsible for perpetrating torture against an isolated individual in a cell and is also responsible for taking public positions against torture, it has 2 heads, and 2 faces. <sep> For a brief moment, during this ceremony, when each of the 5 poets received their books from LPT, while Madam Vev Furcy was also present. <sep> This began when Bizlall fired a union at CEB from GWF, affecting GWF. <sep> This started in England when the Government nationalized Northern Rock, which was one of the first victims of the housing crisis in Zini State. <sep> But, it will only be a matter of time before the victims speak out. <sep> We are not only interested in reducing poverty, but also in replacing an economic system that exacerbates poverty. <sep> But what are they doing in schools and lessons? I remember there were people who were saying that there are many children who despite going to school during the week, from Monday to Saturday, leave school without being able to read, write, or count. <sep> There is a rising problem in the world. We are living in a very interesting era. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Everyone was listening, a mouse did not fly: ODEK Odek, the rainbow is zigzagging over there, a big star is following it; the sun is losing its green petal as fast as lightning; the rainbow that got a fine fit is dancing with the tune of a white guitar. <sep><sep> But Adam, he was creating directly, they believed you. <sep><sep> In his language, man liked to say: why nourish veins if one can drink blood by meat? But remember a quick glance in the first dawn was stuck in his memory. <sep><sep> We are presenting a speech by Ally Lazer (member of the Dr Idrice Goomany Center) on the issue of drug trafficking on the occasion of the LALIT organized State of Emergency on 1 and 2 November 2011, GRNW. <sep><sep> But, at that time many other delegates, including Paul Berenger, were all tired. <sep><sep> When they arrived in front of an abandoned house, Karonn stopped. <sep><sep> There were very interesting social work to collect data on how people were living in Chagos. <sep><sep> We have followed this evolution in LALIT's "Campaign for an Alternative Economy". <sep><sep> And often, these socialist militants in the trade union movement, in a period such as today's, are in a minority. <sep><sep> When giving a private company the land for 99 years, whether it's in Riche Terre, Cassis, it becomes serious. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is us who are bringing the fight against repression and communalism. <sep><sep> Today LALIT is continuing to bring this fight in favor of the class struggle, which MMM has abandoned. <sep><sep> This collection of poems will become a book to be released in the coming year as part of Independence 46. <sep><sep> Thus, the establishment effectively forms part of the “historical bloc”, as it is in a coalition together with PT, not before elections, but with a power balance that cannot be dictated. <sep><sep> On the other hand, you take another service to continue the struggle. <sep><sep> At a certain moment, after the popular uprising of the 48th against

France will re-shut down the Isle of Rodrigues, with the intention of taking control of the economic crisis in the area, similar to what it did during the Independence crisis in 44. <sep><sep> A representative of olive planters explained that an armed colony from Kfar Tappuah has entered the olive grove with its goats, they have threatened the olive trees, broken the olive branches, and threatened the planters. <sep><sep> Then they no longer need to look for strong explanations of how their miseries are because they belong to such and such a community, they have no home because they belong to such and such a community. <sep><sep> If each case protects its mountain, the mountain and its case will always be in good hands. <sep><sep> However, most of the violence was directed with scientific precision against certain stations, and it is these stations that have been threatened and even destroyed by the people's claims in this solely against the state. <sep><sep> Many members of LALIT took a position against the Law on Employment. <sep><sep> We made a call FOR AN ALTERNATIVE ECONOMY and our book with the same title has been received positively, they are on the shelf, and have been circulating widely in Mauritius. <sep><sep> In the next municipal elections, MMM could reclaim certain cities, such as Port Louis (even if Cehl Meeah makes it difficult for him) and Beau Bassin-Rose Hill. <sep><sep> His imprisonment poses a double dilemma: to keep this person out of society freely because he is a troublemaker when he is moving freely (according to the UBZIE magistrates). <sep><sep> This is the classification that is written in Schedule 1, Constitution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a movement that primarily targets the bourgeoisie in Mauritius that has to sell its discus, that has to sell its T-shirts. <sep><sep> This means, one must start with beer, in a certain sense. <sep><sep> Or, there is a significant element of class struggle in this. <sep><sep> This means they need to increase their storage capacity, which involves further expenses to buy tanks. <sep><sep> In general, crises affect everyone, but those with a certain stock (usually those in the bourgeoisie) have a certain buffer against crises. <sep><sep> Everyone needs to have the possibility in things like a job, where they are digging in the garden, where people are creating new ideas, new analyses. <sep><sep> In 2009, Minister of Education Vasant Bunwaree announced officially, when he launched the Creole Festival, that he would "introduce the Creole language as a medium in schools in 2010". <sep><sep> There was much debate on this laser beam that came from a building in the military outpost located in Settlement Ariel near the suburb. <sep><sep> This is why an entire Village Council (in the village of L’Avenir in the East) resigned in protest. <sep><sep> Employers' rights must continue to be profitable. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, following the 2010 elections, the MMM party became weakened by the MSM through a campaign based on several points, particularly the Medpoint issue, which ultimately became so strong that it led to the resignation of the MSM from the Government. <sep><sep> He may maintain this control, if he can provide it in other ways. <sep><sep> The union does not challenge the fact that we are forced to sell all our potential to create revenues for a tiny portion of the population, exempt from living. <sep><sep> This includes nurses, teachers, small farmers, doctors, all people who need to work to live, are lumped into the working class. <sep><sep> Mam LALIT Lindsey Collen had invited through the Student Union at a university in Mauritius to make a presentation to 75 students. <sep><sep> In the past, the Municipality was involved in the construction of bomb shelters for people in rural areas: with the crisis in housing that is becoming more and more serious, it is necessary for the municipality to take the initiative to solve the housing problem. <sep><sep> We went to the Red Crescent clinic, which is like a small health center. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius today, we are witnessing a social upheaval that is coming. <sep><sep> However, since 2000, there has been a Supreme Court case, since Judge Seetulsing clearly stated that the Best Loser system cannot be implemented by the Supreme Court. <sep><sep> The government has decided to remove old age pensions as a right. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this paper, we will look at the historical debate in Mauritius on the question of "nationalism" in the last 35 years, reflecting the post-independence debates on this issue. <sep> <sep> It recounts how they used to hold hands, twirl around, and hit it. <sep> <sep> Often in a family, a group of women like this, it is believed to be the largest mobilization in a country. <sep> <sep> It was the occasion of the launch of the LPT's new "space threat" in its GRNW building, red-leaved. <sep> <sep> We find that in the context of the economic crisis, there is an attempt from different forces to disarm the working class with nationalism, Mauritianism, bourgeois patriotism. <sep> <sep> So, they are not seeing the seriousness of the crisis, but rather small, punctual points. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, Olivier Bancoult is starting to talk about national flags and the Chagos Lim. <sep> <sep> Neither the former nor the new Government has a plan to confront this reality. <sep> <sep> 3. It determines the conditions under which this work will be done. <sep> <sep> Also, if, as a Government, you continue to force parents at Tamarin or St. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is also a focus on political strategy by LALIT to overthrow the bourgeois state, to establish a Workers' State until it can abolish all social classes. <sep><sep> In Mauritius today, in addition to the economic crisis, there is a systemic crisis. <sep><sep> His robe and his slippers, when he was growing up he kept growing out of them. <sep><sep> And to this day there is even a faction that emerged prominently in the PMSD camp. <sep><sep> It is also worth noting that when, in 4 years later, the Lalit Youth Group was launched, we decided that there should be a certain degree of autonomy because it reigned over a 20-year-old youth. <sep><sep> This, it is another aspect of its "democratization of the economy" policy. <sep><sep> We must boycott Caterpillar, which sells bulldozers to destroy Palestinian houses under Israeli military occupation. <sep><sep> For political reasons, for reasons of class, because the establishment was too powerful (and still is too powerful) and it had the means to block the more demanding, more combative union. <sep><sep> - It is not a "mere minute" for our association anymore, when the Secretary is listening to the progress of our meeting in Creole or Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> However, in the meantime, without any scorn, at a time when Bérenger was Prime Minister, he welcomed Zizman Balancy to stand as an MPL candidate for the general election, after Zizman Balancy, he was not obliged to classify him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Israeli Air Force also bombarded the village of Rafah in an attempt to destroy a Hamas training base, where 4

occupation. <sep><sep> However, during this time, the Chagossian Social Committee was also formed and is actively seeking social welfare for Chagossians and Chagos children. <sep><sep> It is good that we all understand exactly what we are talking about politically, what we are saying through this. <sep><sep> This has gone on until 2000, we have carried out the same exercise, and sometimes with persons like Parvez Karrimkan, Yousouf Mohamed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, if a worker is maltreated, not paid his salary, put out on the street naked, discriminated against based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, HIV positive, or because he became pregnant. <sep><sep> There is no better public expenditure by a government than expenditure on democracy, on electoral representation, that is, on parliamentarians. <sep><sep> This commitment is important because it is also part of the struggle against imperialism, against international bourgeois power. <sep><sep> We need to develop a new sector that produces non-GMO food for export on a large scale. <sep><sep> Naturally, from a lexical perspective, they are also used to increase or consolidate children's vocabulary, because children come into contact with words that they either did not know before or had only heard. <sep><sep> Starting from an Appendix attached to the Constitution of Mauritius, the Electoral Commissioner still nominates 8 Best Losers on the basis of community and/or party, providing their nomination does not change the election results. <sep><sep> So, this is a new issue that needs to be addressed. <sep><sep> Dinesh Ram Seegobin said he was not passing by No.3 Port Louis. <sep><sep> He wants to eat, drink, live, and enjoy life before his death, his children as well, eat, drink. <sep><sep> LALIT, we participate in elections and elections are not the only means for us to survive politically. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Early in the morning, before they arrival, the police had broken all their tents and installations and were barricading those places to prevent them from working. <sep><sep> He said there is already evidence that shows that with land and the climate in Mauritius, one can plant a variety of other things apart from sugar cane. <sep><sep> So, the importance of this action, is that we are publicly announcing why anyone would oppose the Chagos. <sep><sep> This strike has directly started towards free education. <sep><sep> c) Bids are coming in to propose to cultivate all soils with productivity, and with the capacity for employers to pay. <sep><sep> Why did we choose to look at the different classes on the same boat? <sep><sep> This meeting is following directly to our "Let Uver at Prime Minister". <sep><sep> At the same time, these bourgeois political parties are encouraging speculation on land with IRS, ERS, and Shopping Mall processes. <sep><sep> It is a shorter poem that Rashid Bundhoo has presented in this collection. <sep><sep> He has carefully protected the interests of the bourgeoisie particularly in the city in the commercial and intellectual sector. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to the 2000 Government Census, 93% of the population of Mauritius speaks Creole and/or Bhojpuri languages. <sep><sep> Lalit, is the only political party that has exposed the Local Government Bill for what it is: a law that restricts democratic space and brings a significant imbalance between democracy and decentralization. <sep><sep> There was also a Marine soldier who made a testimony. <sep><sep> The entire political foundation of all "scandals": PT protects its people in the bourgeoisie (capitalists who want to get into big business). <sep><sep> This establishment, to stop discrimination, should take action. <sep><sep> But, because it is comprehensible, it is something that can be more easily transmitted. <sep><sep> It is the same way with the production of poultry, pork, fish, shrimp, and other seafood. <sep><sep> There is a lady, she is here with her little boy, he is 6-7 years old. <sep><sep> Even the government, through the voice of the Prime Minister, will have to move forward with certain proposals, even if they are very timid, in favor of using Creole language in schools. <sep><sep> So, it has made concessions (Rs 57 million) to the establishment, but instead, it has stabilized its new "historical block", which was apparently founded where it was ideological, and has brought about splits in MMM, the formation of MSM (PSM and a split in MMM). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Soldiers are not giving up, and they are starting to say that the people are alone since a long time. <sep><sep> We have also analyzed the budget, the state, financial crisis, Diego's disappearance, the issue with Minister Rama Valayden. <sep><sep> Health was good but the company was on the brink of collapse. <sep><sep> We must not seek a dubious advantage, promote a bit of rebalancing, seek a two-job solution, on a military basis serving to kill people's children. <sep><sep> We know that it is the people who make their own fate. <sep><sep> Today i am taking a stance with the LALIT Party on the Industrial Relations Act. <sep><sep> They call it a bourgeois state, it is there to impose and enforce its own ideology, its own plan. <sep><sep> In the comments that LALIT made on the Employment Relations Bill on September 3, 2007, we started our article by saying that this law is based on a mix of content from the White Paper that ex-Minister Soodhun presented in the name of the MMM-MSM Government in 2004. <sep><sep> Delegates are gathering in Cairo at the League for preparation and then to direct the border crossing along with Gaza on December 27-28. <sep><sep> But as soon as death comes, robbers were taking lives through force. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If we go into details, we will find many examples where the colonial state had ways to impose itself on the social, economic and political class. <sep><sep> In Seychelles, there was a man called Todd, a Frenchman, an important person. <sep><sep> He was funding NGOs to get their support and cooperation. <sep><sep> The workers had begun to have an economic policy that allowed for the development of a "state bourgeoisie" from the middle bourgeoisie on plantations, commerce, and industry. <sep><sep> Fortunately, the guard did not take him to the place where a doctor could consult him when he finished the beating. <sep><sep> They kept at it, until finally, Berenger realized that he had fallen into a trap. <sep><sep> It is in favor that the Israeli government engaged in discussions with Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. <sep><sep> He thought that people would forgive him for making many sacrifices, he was hitting the nail on the head. <sep><sep> So, we were in a conflict between GWF and FTU foundation. But, in the late 70s, by 1979, FTU and GWF united in the UT 79 strike. <sep><sep> Berenger is simply saying that Cehl Meeah is changing the name of Hezbollah and instead, Cehl Meeah is saying Berenger is putting the MPL. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The "Historical Bloc" had a following ideology, which it advocated: Local production must be encouraged to build the "nation", nurture "import substitution". <sep> However, we have been able to analyze limitations, weaknesses and dangers of "facebook" when used as a tool to develop a strict militant. <sep> It is noted that we have been organizing social, trade union, NGO, etc. gatherings. <sep> Furthermore, a group of young people distributing on the signs has been stopped by an Israeli army jeep (Jeypsh name to say the Israeli army / Israeli soldiers in Palestinians). <sep> People will come together to work, as we have already done, during the 9/10 years of our existence. <sep> This realization is coming into a pre-revolutionary era. <sep> Many people will find MCB manager and Sentinel boss as a progressive boss. <sep> The working class organization together with LALIT has mobilized against the demands of the State Welfare. <sep> People were not needing them to try to get a little bit with the gentleman. <sep> They are no longer getting the same pampering as before. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we arrived, all 133 olive trees were there and full of olives. <sep><sep> If we take particular items on which the National Platform has mobilized, we will understand it well. <sep><sep> In terms of ICT, core center, they are also affected by the Euro crisis and in Great Britain. <sep><sep> In this context of a class struggle, the level of LALIT of Seychelles in Mauritius distinguishes itself from other organizations, and other forces that are working to challenge the system that brings about misery, which is responsible for working class exploitation. <sep><sep> and be aware that this will continue under the current government. <sep><sep> In addition to these main principles, LALIT also has ideas on the Gokhool Plan and police brutality. <sep><sep> The Privy Council decreed that 50% of reserved places was an illegal discrimination, and oriental languages were accounted for in elementary school teaching, even though there is no longer a ranking, which created this demand. <sep><sep> Martin was a good patient and as he relaxed a bit, quickly his comical spirit took over. <sep><sep> At that time, he was not thinking about politics but was starting to think about using his talent and experience to take control of the Gonndouana state. <sep><sep> He suffered defeats in 1982, 1991, and 2000. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then his finished house would have allowed him some breathing space. <sep> <sep> On Friday evening, four days before he fell with a cerebral hemorrhage, he was present at the Grand River Northwest. <sep> <sep> Indicators of erratic development can indicate where there are problems, but not where the causes of problems lie. <sep> <sep> The working class today has several decades of the experience of the presence of a Marxist current, that is a current that understands politics in a profound sense, not just electoral. <sep> <sep> Ultimately all that the PPP means is a well-thought-out Public Pirates Plan. <sep> <sep> The government is choosing to put it in a framework where there will be no wastage of agricultural land. <sep> <sep> This presupposes a "threat of unemployment" in the last quarter of this year, workers will not get anything, but will then hold a thank you rally in Port Louis. <sep> <sep> There is a group composed of Nita Deerpalsing, Cader Sayed Hossen, Patrick Assirdaven, Reza Issack, and the small Shakeel Mohamed, who all together in a block in favor of this "economic democratization." <sep> <sep> There is no such immediate relationship that even exists in the production sector. <sep> <sep> Here is the time when we are holding this International Conference. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At 10:00 pm, we have considered other possibilities. 
<sep><sep> Indeed, we found that this link cannot be manipulated. 
<sep><sep> In a place where PCs (in the USSR, as well as in France, Italy, and South Africa) have lost their clear reputation, as a force for punishment (for our generation, they lost their credibility since the 1920s!). 
<sep><sep> So, it will be interesting to observe medical ethics. 
<sep><sep> We have asked the question "How does government policy serve the ruling class, when we, when we vote in elections, vote for a political party, believing it will benefit those who voted for it, what do we find? 
<sep><sep> When we listened to him, we realized to what extent this country needed it. 
<sep><sep> A member asked what the real problem is, then. 
<sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee recently took a PRAESA course, which brought a lot of development in reflections on LPT, including an analysis at the Ministry of Education on the issue of genocide in education through language policy. 
<sep><sep> Bangladeshi people who are targeted; Azan Workers, MSM? Economic sector concerns; Real estate transactions. 
<sep><sep> When I tell you that it's not a good idea because we need to focus our public attention on listening to music and lyrics instead of watching Miss Wai's belly dance, they are happy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> JUSTICE has prevailed against the brutality of the police force. <sep><sep> But it is too naive to believe that love can make Diego find his way back to London without his guide. <sep><sep> And as I said, our program, our reading program, our overall program, is something that is evolving, becoming more real. <sep><sep> The luggage he received as a gift from Malaysia was clearly visible on his right side! <sep><sep> Today, with the capitalist globalization based on military power, a yellow key has become ingrained in the hands of imperial powers and their bourgeoisie to continue monitoring and expanding their control over regions with resources such as oil or gas. <sep><sep> A thinker explained how it is becoming increasingly difficult to live peacefully in the West. <sep><sep> Finally, transport workers are interested in coordinating their struggle with the struggle all workers are carrying out against the hostility and threats imposed by the capitalist system in crisis. <sep><sep> In fact, it is the second International Prize that LPT is receiving for his work. <sep><sep> The Labour Party, a party that, since the time of the USSR, has been at the head of a Historic Bloc, the Labour Party, together with the Bourgeois State and especially the sugar cane plantation owners: <sep><sep> There was no real political will to develop an economy that is less dependent on external factors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Through meetings and reflection at the grassroots level, conditions need to be created to consider agricultural production and promote alternative economies that will be controlled by everyone. <sep><sep> The European and US governments today are implementing the same wrong programs that the World Bank and the IMF applied in countries like Mauritius, African countries, Asia, Latin America in the past. <sep><sep> Their music and lyrics were so good that they got contracts to play in many countries abroad and their cassettes and CDs were selling like hotcakes worldwide. <sep><sep> Our first trick was to attend the Asia-Pacific conference organized by the DSP in Australia. <sep><sep> During this period, everyone will agree that the bourgeoisie was acting as a revolutionary force. <sep><sep> And, if you never said, that Goethe was not a political fighter, I maintain that it is precisely us, political fighters, who need to rise above all these trivial matters. <sep><sep> Each person prepared a section and we put it together to make a document. <sep><sep> It must also be pointed out that linguists like Carol Benson: 2004 'Background paper prepared for the Education for All, Global Monitoring Report 2005, The Quality Imperative, the importance of mother tongue-based schooling for educational quality'. <sep><sep> Likewise, for a grammar teacher to use, which is almost identical. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This type of financial boycott is more necessary when we reach the time where the military base negotiations located on the territory of the Republic of Mauritius, that is on Diego Garcia need to be renegotiated. <sep> <sep> Here, PT has erected and maintained its Historic Block - from 1936 to today. <sep> <sep> Even in a country where there are things to eat and drink, but it's not just about gluttony. <sep> <sep> We have initiated a "Front for Food Security" and have started mobilizing to address food security crises. <sep> <sep> Since it's not a purely agricultural program, since they don't have one, and therefore, they can't have one. <sep> <sep> So, building international links in such a time is not easy. <sep> <sep> So, the socialist program that we advocate in LALIT, we call it a transitional program. <sep> <sep> While the attention of the world is focused on developments in the region from Gaza, the State of Israel is continuing to illegally occupy and perpetuate its colonization of Palestinian land in the West Bank. <sep> <sep> During an “up-turn”, people in quantities seek a program, seeking through them. <sep> <sep> And it corresponds somewhat to the decrease in votes that has gone to the 2 blocs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is not a State where the dominant economic class can exceed, because it had a colonial State with a certain degree of autonomy since the dominant economic class. <sep><sep> He needs to make an application to the Termination of Contracts of Service Board and explain why he is seeking redundancy. <sep><sep> There is erosion of power, there is a rise in precariousness, and we are finding new legislation that is attacking workers' rights and unions. <sep><sep> In 1978 in Afghanistan, there was what was called the Saur revolution, led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (known as PDPA). <sep><sep> IWW was not only active in America, it also had branches in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and England. <sep><sep> He clearly takes the personal positions of Berenger and Ramgoolam that we are hearing. <sep><sep> And to make the Government even more unpopular, it says that if no one ever replaces something strong in its form, the State will continue it. <sep><sep> There are cases that are still being heard in the Intermediate Court against 4 men of MCIT in the case of M. <sep><sep> A girl must learn how to cook, sew, embroider, clean the house, and wash clothes. <sep><sep> Misery was giving birth to goodness and especially another quality of life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Bizlall is writing these violent attacks against Rajni and me, these malicious attacks, he is telling all the other young girls, "What will I do if you ever speak against me, if you ever criticize me!". <sep><sep> Her family is talking to him, her neighbors are talking to him, her friends are talking to him, in school everyone is talking to him, everyone is talking to him in French, except for a child from Mauritius, it's impossible. <sep><sep> All companies and firms, in the morning we found, they are scattered in the country. <sep><sep> Her doctor told her that her lip was about to get gangrene. <sep><sep> She can even impose a 12-hour shift - a completely inhuman shift system. <sep><sep> She is only interested in making as much money as possible, selling her hard work as late as possible so that she can make money to eat, drink, send her child to school, spend time on the ball field, drink a beer, spend time on the ball field. <sep><sep> She put emphasis on the fact that if we do not organize politically, the working class will always be at the mercy of either the historical bourgeoisie or the rising capitalist section. <sep><sep> So, the future will not be the same for everyone. <sep><sep> She brought a campaign against independence at a time when RM and PM were in power. <sep><sep> An association that contains more than the entirety of knowledge and understanding of each member together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is in Block 104, and also in our new Group 72. <sep><sep> Today, if the Creole language is not recognized as the official language of the Republic of Mauritius, it is because for a long time, Creole and Bhojpuri languages have not been considered as real languages. <sep><sep> The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Revi in Ziyet has helped us understand the nature and functioning of a Revi, and has made us realize its political importance. <sep><sep> And this return to "making a difference" has, in turn, worsened "politics" even more. <sep><sep> There will be no jobs created, no laws made, and no progress in the energy problem. <sep><sep> There are not just problems with food scarcity due to rising climate sanctions, but also the increasing price of cold, which is putting pressure to increase prices even more. <sep><sep> Since 1981 the Education for Workers and other progressive organizations and individuals, have kept the celebration in a national center around the use of the Mauritian Creole language. <sep><sep> As they finish signing that hedge contract on $104, within a month, from a carrier rate of $140, it becomes $40. <sep><sep> An economist from the World Bank (Carol Benson says she doesn't know why they have shown an interest in a country through their mother tongue) has conducted a COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS of the mother tongue in Guatemala with their own money. <sep><sep> Before that, on his Linked-In CV, he was even working for the US. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He pleaded guilty to cashing check, wearing a mask, covering his tracks, saying "no evidence", pleaded guilty to causing damage because he accepted responsibility for torturing. <sep><sep> The family voted for a female candidate, or a team with more female representation. <sep><sep> So when the group formed like this, it was clear that it needed a certain degree of autonomy. <sep><sep> The Artisans and General Workers' Union (AGWU) has met with MSM, MMM, and the Minister. <sep><sep> And it has spent its Rs144 million, which we don't really know where it went. <sep><sep> For 25 years, no student has ever said it was difficult to read or write. <sep><sep> But, he is facing a series of problems to prevent Chagossians from going to Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> They brought in quite progressive reforms later, promoting women's rights and organizing a modern state administration. <sep><sep> However, it is worth noting that when Ramgoolam negotiated with England in 1965, Mauritius was still a colony, so its Prime Minister did not really have the power to "negotiate" with his "master". <sep><sep> Or is it another "bubble" like the one that caused the crisis, a "sub-prime bubble" but at the top? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He even put this in writing from the time of Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> And, when we talk about food security, we notice that there are no provisions in Budget 2008-09 for subsidizing rice and flour. <sep><sep> And even if, at the time, it was true, our campaign allowed many people in the working class to understand this slogan well. <sep><sep> Especially MMM and PT, which were parties that had their origins in the working class and had a mission to represent workers but have deviated, ending up representing another class, the capitalist class. <sep><sep> All the different forms of "nation," an analysis of them, and also of "nationalism," when it is considered as an ideology. <sep><sep> And they will also bring their communalism into the discussion with everyone else, as well. <sep><sep> But, even though we say that trade union unity does not automatically create conditions for socialism, in its grand movement, it is forming a vanguard among workers, and it is this vanguard that will participate in the revolutionary political struggle that will bring about socialism. <sep><sep> We kissed and said we will rule with all the villagers." That's how the soldier was forced to release the boy. <sep><sep> The Daybreak Movement for the Liberation of Women has already submitted a copy of the content of this book to the Ministry of Justice. <sep><sep> When the bourgeoisie State began to take shape, it had no communal connotations because the direction of the PTr had already become bourgeois and had delocalized itself from communalism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We believe that the Chagossians have the right to return, but also as a matter of sovereignty, a process of decolonization. <sep><sep> There is a delicate balance of power payment, and the imbalance between the citizens and their Government is increasingly obvious as well. <sep><sep> There was even a meeting between 8 peace activists in Tokyo and Ragini. <sep><sep> All the advertising agencies that place ads in Le Mauricien or L'Express could earn several million rupees per month. <sep><sep> Schools are not teaching reading/writing, but rather creating strong concepts in children's minds, with error-prone learning through multiple languages that children do not understand. <sep><sep> To obtain a local license, as all workers know, requires agreement from the employer. <sep><sep> Then, they get an opportunity to "dig in" against the adversary, enemy. <sep><sep> It must be remembered that this second course was made possible because of requests from various organizations that work to promote the Creole language. <sep><sep> If the municipal elections go well, then there may be some alliances. <sep><sep> A. Jugnauth also knows how to campaign against the mafia drug trade, supported by the police tandem Morvan-Mestry and that had a commission chaired by Rault. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In historical bourgeoisie, do they feel they have a valid interlocutor in the current Government? <sep><sep> We have started to develop "Biltin sayt", a project that Lutte Ouvriere in France has developed and shown to us. <sep><sep> for example, where there were not even 2 larger parties in elections, radios and the press have succeeded in reducing the election to a battle between "snow and uncle", like a chariot to escort automata and the fleeing. <sep><sep> There are certain regular readers who find their way back through syndicates or associations. <sep><sep> Arbitration by Government, employers consider, in the present time, it in favor of the workers. <sep><sep> At our congress, we made the decision to make the Web more accessible. <sep><sep> One day an eminent economic-political theorist made a great discovery: an ordinary slave produces less than a salaried slave. <sep><sep> From 1991, MMM and MSM continue the same policy towards America. <sep><sep> Obama said we need to raise the ceiling and proposed shy measures to reduce expenses so that they can reduce that debt, while Republicans believe they can serve. <sep><sep> Reading from the novel Mutiny written by Lindsey Collen on the descent from Sagos: Ashish Beesoondyal (confirmed). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, we are facing a possible exponential acceleration of climate change, largely due to our dependence on fossil fuels. <sep><sep> Olivier has started responding to Greenpeace, saying that when they took a stand on the Marine Park, "we wrote to them" and they responded that the Chagossians must be kept in mind. <sep><sep> On our website, in 2011, in the "News" section there is a paper that you can go read and study. <sep><sep> a humanist Marxist had launched the idea of creating an international network that would bring together anti-capitalist movements, revolutionary movements that were somewhat scattered around the world. <sep><sep> Let's not forget also the first visit of a US Secretary of State to Mauritius, namely Madam Madeleine Albright. <sep><sep> in trade unions, in neighborhood committees, people are being organized in a way where they can control their participation through the organizations they already have. <sep><sep> They all knew that this crisis was coming. <sep><sep> So, basically, this debt could be rescheduled 3-4 times. <sep><sep> We are protesting against the new Identity Card, and we are calling on the Government to abandon its introduction. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who presided over the press conference, began by giving a historical context in which Lalit had developed its version of Creole-language education and then presented the education program in its English version. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I am starting to understand the term "ideology" which I find present a difficulty, and I am trying to soften its meaning with the theorists who have worked on the concept. <sep><sep> According to him the report is also retrograde because they have pulled a quick one with child. <sep><sep> 2 out of 3 single parent families (18,400) widowed, divorced or separated, meaning head of family <sep><sep> The union challenges the effects of the capitalist system that transforms our work courage (meaning specifically from 8-12 every day) into an objective that sells like any other commodity. <sep><sep> Just before the demonstration, the Cabinet of Ministers announced that Mauritius is strengthening its diplomatic ties with Israel. <sep><sep> So the new royal couple will have to bear a heavy burden: the responsibility for colonial and imperialist policies of the English and American. <sep><sep> After the election candidates and agents can verify that the ballot box is sealed, and they can watch over it all night to prevent tampering. <sep><sep> Since its inception in 1976, up to the year 2004, when Lalit published a reprint of its LANGUAGE PROGRAM 2003, political pressure has been on successive governments to respect the mother tongue of all individuals, especially children. <sep><sep> We can nominate candidates in all constituencies, one or more. <sep><sep> Often an entire state declares war on another, to break it apart, and then reluctantly extend the ceasefire. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The International Workers' Day was celebrated together, in a sunny and warm moment. <sep> <sep> This is often used to allow individuals to introduce themselves to a large group in an informal atmosphere. <sep> <sep> However, for the past 3 years, Friday and Saturday have been declared as Saba and there is no right to harvest olives on this mountain side. <sep> <sep> And at the same time it helps us understand the reality of the past as well. <sep> <sep> A ban on the international humanitarian organization should be lifted so that they can go to the Northern and Sri Lankan regions. <sep> <sep> LALIT's objectives, all our activists meet at least once a week, all our branches meet every 15 days. <sep> <sep> He explained the nature of the crisis in the French zone, and the fact that this will be possible. <sep> <sep> In this regard, he mentioned that negotiations for the renewal should begin in 2014. <sep> <sep> On the other side of the mountain, there is a lease agreement that has been renegotiated and found underground. <sep> <sep> because he will dissolve the National Assembly before the deadline set for the election, a date that is already later than the law allows. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like a guard to a blanket if anyone cooks or rides a motorcycle, like if someone pulls the wrong ear the Mister will say "You need to go close the door, you need to pull a horse's tail and you are going to cry out loud". <sep><sep> In our beef, there is only a salary increase. <sep><sep> So there was a class war where the bourgeois nose was, capital was beginning to accumulate, but there was still no political power, they were leading the war. <sep><sep> What shows the nature of the State in imperialist countries, is doing a Democratic Government of Obama, and a Socialist Government, Hollande, who is invading and re-colonizing Mali. <sep><sep> We're gonna get out of Mauritius, landed in French territory, because we need to give Gamma something, since he's financing that far-right party. <sep><sep> And for Ragini Kistnasamy, who will be in the same session with John Percy. <sep><sep> In the Chamber of Mazer Lantern a woman was appointed supreme commander. <sep><sep> We managed to avoid identifying the name with such and such a name, such and such a section of the trade union movement. <sep><sep> Three guards who were watching it had disappeared. <sep><sep> Since the strike started on Wednesday, the 26th of July, there has been a move from the Government to crush the unionist in a negotiation that seeks to demobilize workers: the problem of the privatization of the 5 CNT really hasn't been solved, but the wage increase is being discussed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Until now, if one wants to understand why, despite America being a highly modern country with Hollywood, etc., it is actually a deeply conservative country. <sep><sep> Everyone felt that they had a mission that God had decided for them and from that moment they all put all their faith in their mission. <sep><sep> There was a jeep with just a soldier stationed in the village entrance. <sep><sep> He set up his system, tracked everyone's work, established his bonus system, everything. <sep><sep> Whether it's a big hotel company or a big bank, they are declaring huge profits. <sep><sep> When being used in schools, its development will continue. <sep><sep> In the meeting, there were people of all kinds of race, experience, and industry. <sep><sep> The government has therefore agreed to provide good schools for all children, as well as a comprehensive and free education system. <sep><sep> On Sunday, the 5th at 1:00 pm, there was a Kalypso gathering at the Plann Futbol Flic-en-Flac to protest against the Aquatic Business Bill which will allow the privatization of our collective heritage. <sep><sep> We must use this right to vote that previous generations have fought for so that we can benefit from it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Chantale Lefranc has spoken in the name of the Family Liberation Movement. <sep> <sep> We have 4 candidates who are under the age of 24 and will be voting for the first time. <sep> <sep> Do we think we are achieving their goals as needed? <sep> <sep> A pollution-free environment, both noise pollution and environmental pollution, is an "environmental right". <sep> <sep> But with the worsening economic crisis, there is no right for employers in power to prefer the MMM party in the government. <sep> <sep> So, the depreciation of the rupee has worsened the population's standard of living: workers, unemployed, pensioners, small traders, small farmers. <sep> <sep> And if we don't bend (at least bend, to organize our state), we won't have food for ourselves or our children. <sep> <sep> The first decision he made was to clean up his office to get rid of all traces of corruption and male dominance. <sep> <sep> And this is what is happening now, under pressure from countries like Australia, Brazil, and Thailand, they are also producing and exporting sugarcane to the World Trade Market at a price that is almost 1/3 of what European producers receive. <sep> <sep> Mauritianism is an ideological construction that some people convey through concepts like ‘national unity’, ‘unity in diversity’, ‘ancient society’, ‘one people one nation’, ‘I am 100% Mauritian,’ ‘authentic Mauritian’, etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We believe that this system where there is a private company responsible for production, is a system where each company is organized in the same pyramid. <sep><sep> And it is happening as long as the Minister of Finance, Sithanen, is absent. <sep><sep> What Workers, inside him, not just inside him, become clasee workers, like their MLC, also get their small bourgeoisie, their lawyers. <sep><sep> If we make the mistake of calling our country "Lil Moris", we exclude Chagos that is illegally occupied by USA-UK, and Tromlen illegally occupied by France. <sep><sep> Given the increase in food allergies due to GMOs found in the UK, <sep><sep> So, with the health problems of Paul Bérenger, it becomes possible for him to accept going to Reduit. <sep><sep> They are criticizing people who have either a super-economic interpretation or specifically about the role of the "State", which, according to them, leads them to believe that it is possible to change the world by changing just a few aspects of capitalist domination and exploitation. <sep><sep> Unfortunate that fate has fallen on him as if on a creature to look deeper into his faith, to give him the opportunity to clean up his life in the hands of God, to become an instrument of salvation in the sky. <sep><sep> It was a false system, a system without truth. <sep><sep> We will, through this struggle, manage to obtain the right to return with dignity for all Chagossians, as well as Mauritians. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Any subsidy in the economic sector should be in line with the spirit of economic freedom - entrepreneurship and commerce. <sep><sep> He decided to send Paloma to the prom and marry Berenice, a person from his world who plays chess on a higher level. <sep><sep> At that point, Rada Kistnasamy gave details about the Strategic Political Seminar. <sep><sep> We have brought reflections and debates on another type of economy that questions the economy based on sugar cane cultivation. <sep><sep> MMM announced that it will definitely support candidate Ashok Jugnauth. <sep><sep> Lalit will also announce the number of visitors on our website. <sep><sep> The family is already overwhelmed with household chores and taking care of children, so it will be doubly oppressive. <sep><sep> A transitional program based on the demand that the working class must defend today, and that in the capitalist system, they will not be able to succeed. <sep><sep> In 1995, when we were in partial alliance with PMT, Bizlall watched all the FPU rallies during the election, they found that they would get between 4,000 and 5,000 votes to start. <sep><sep> Stop VRS, and transfer workers to diversification sectors on the same terms as sugar cane cultivation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the 1930s, for the first time the entire population became involved in political life. <sep><sep> In this context of repression, the Minister of Finance announced that he is introducing a new Smart Identity Card, a "smart card", which will give the State centralized information on each citizen. <sep><sep> This is completely illegal, there cannot be this anti-union clause in a labor contract. <sep><sep> However, in Mauritius, what concerns us the most is exactly what the Government is doing so that we can face such a crisis. <sep><sep> But it is “bourgeois democracy”, meaning it is “bourgeois” in the sense that individual freedoms are taken away and the population is fragmented into individuals, atomizing a population. <sep><sep> Everyone depends on everyone else. <sep><sep> In the face of the attacks on our freedoms. <sep><sep> MIE in its weakness, how do we structure new teachers? <sep><sep> Partner Mike Cole, Susi Knopf, participated in plenary debates, and in informal sessions highlighted his actual legal status. <sep><sep> So, the Historical Block organized meetings and discussions, and it was like this: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Bil visit will allow large businesses and multinational companies to build marinas for tourist boats, private fish farms, and other businesses that serve the sea. <sep><sep> Surely because MSM-MMM has established its Republic, and PT-MSM is in power now.<sep><sep> This is why a lack of democracy, at its deepest level, is also at its most dangerous level. <sep><sep>  There was a time when “offenses” were easily excused. <sep><sep> In 1994, Lalit launched a major campaign through a local and international petition. <sep><sep> The co-founder of the city of Jericho was happy to say that there was a special place for Jericho and from that time the people of Jericho and Jericho's residents believed that their city was used as a model to build paradise. <sep><sep> Until the Government lost its Finance Minister, the Prime Minister insisted on appointing a new Governor of the Bank of Mauritius. <sep><sep> This boss is not fair. He wants all his workers to multitask, that is when there is work in the kitchen you work, when there is no work in the kitchen, he gives you a broom and sends you to the court. <sep><sep> It is also interesting to note that, as in Mauritius as well as in Indonesia, there is a movement in the working class to question the capitalist system itself. <sep><sep> All the workers who work to live understand how this is happening: when we go to work, the prices of everything have doubled; however, salaries have not increased. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another problem in AWC, when we didn't give priority to solidarity in All Workers', it was not the same as LALIT. <sep><sep> He remembered the past, he understood the present, and he often predicted events before they unfolded. <sep><sep> So all kinds of new ideas were taking shape at that moment, or rather being born at that moment. <sep><sep> What kind of influence has he managed to develop towards state bourgeoisie? <sep><sep> Secondly we think that this award attributes a special value to the work of promoting literacy itself. <sep><sep> Also Dr. Doudou Dienne expressed what we had just said: he said that one of the most serious forms of slavery is communal classification. <sep><sep> Then, we have had articles in Le Defi, Le Quotidien, Le Dimanche, and finally Le Mauricien about their resignation. <sep><sep> Our actions and methods of struggle in LALIT connect one with the other, with our political side, with our political program, and it is an expression of our political strategy. <sep><sep> But we criticize the class worker organizations because we want the working class to take power again. <sep><sep> "Sandra O'Reilly's courage has brought a new situation to Mauritius, where society in general, that is, the human mass in Mauritius, has brought forth these 4 violences. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The debate on an economic alternative has started in the country and in MARON almost simultaneously without either side knowing what the other is doing. <sep><sep> Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for poor and working people. <sep><sep> In other words, it has become a melodramatic soap opera, overloading all emotions onto something trivial. <sep><sep> As we have said, the systemic crisis creates unemployment, creates legal problems, increases family breakdown, provokes violence in families, provides for heinous crimes in neighborhoods, worsens the problem of mafia and drug trafficking, amplifies child and adult prostitution, delinquency, theft and rape. <sep><sep> And we found a more aggressive role played by the French Embassy, the latter 4-5 years in terms of cultural and with its IMF. <sep><sep> The difference between Palestinians in 1948 and Palestinians in 1967 and Palestinians after the Oslo Accord. <sep><sep> For the 2000 General Elections, one year after the death of Kaya and just February 99, were Berenger and Rama Valayden not on the same platform? <sep><sep> In a nutshell, it represents everyone in society. <sep><sep> On the issue of diversification, there are people like Prof Juggessur who have written good papers on diversification. <sep><sep> And it was such a success that it continues. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And if he doesn't want to risk losing ground face to Re-make MMM-MSM, PTr will have to join with MMM before. <sep> American boss comes, he says, "That's not possible! Must have tins, must have bonuses, must have good presence!". <sep> What is important now is that we have discovered what is really called "a program" among us. <sep> The boss can take someone when he wants, put someone out when he wants. <sep> There are 2 cases that the police have filed against Lindsey Collen and Ram Seegobin who represent the worst repression (go on our site). <sep> Felix, and St Aubin has exhausted himself, made discs, sold, but he still hasn't paid what there is to pay artisan St. <sep> So, outsourcing is not just production, but administrative outsourcing like accounting. <sep> So, they have allowed the boss to put his tins system, his bonuses, and they have put money in one pot, sharing it equally. <sep> There were 'Indian' and 'Chinese', who frankly represented new immigrants. <sep> But, the Jugnauth-Berenger government tried to make villages become municipalities. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the main focus of our participation is to influence the ongoing campaign. <sep><sep> One thing is for sure, he has ambitions to become the leader of the party with certain powers; then we will need a new Workers' leader. <sep><sep> In addition to work towards mobilizing the working class for class demands, demands in favor of his class. <sep><sep> When the government or employers come forward with such a leader it means they want to mask the class struggle, mask the struggle that workers bring and must bring permanently to overturn a system dominated by capitalist class, an economic system. <sep><sep> There is a system not good worded where you can bring a child to serve with a spoon. <sep><sep> If the economy creates poverty, for example, we do not want that economy to dwell. <sep><sep> 1999 - 2001: The Non-Aligned Movement is putting pressure on the disappearance of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. <sep><sep> It's these maneuvers where "social" to make people in Mauritius accustomed with the presence of American military forces in this region. <sep><sep> For us, it is a strategic question that we work with a party like LALIT. <sep><sep> And they expose all these weapons in front of them as a way to intimidate people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How did the USA manage to take care of one part of our country, Mauritius? <sep><sep> Up to the editorials like those of L'Estrac in L'Express and Gilbert Ahnee in Le Mauricien, who used to feel like liberalist mantras, gradually find themselves obligated to take back the LALIT struggle, even if they don't want to admit this LALIT. <sep><sep> And when there are huge demonstrations and protests in Lalzeri at the same time, beautiful demonstrations in Cairo, then we realize, everything that seems stable is not stable. <sep><sep> Following the massive campaign that LALIT has organized on a national level on the need to plant food on tableland, here is the response from the President of the MPA. <sep><sep> It is a contradiction between a historical background and the historical class base of the Workers' Party (where it represents large planters and small planters, where it represents small. <sep><sep> If you deserve it, he says, you will be higher in this inequality. <sep><sep> Under the American AGOA law, they have made a series of rulings that have ultimately benefited more editors than workers in the textile industry. <sep><sep> Then there is a rush in the MMM market that does not agree with any alliances and prefers the options that the MMM is offering. <sep><sep> Current categories of workers in the spectrum, slightly stronger but still quite vulnerable, are workers in the free zone and casual workers. <sep><sep> Will there be a guarantee price that reduces sugar by 36%? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People who understand the electoral process and democratic issues are candidates in general and local elections, deputies and former municipal councilors, and people in democratic associations and unions that have more advanced democratic experience in associations and unions.<sep><sep> Bizlall had said the union movement "was going nowhere" and he eventually turned his back, staged a walk-out.<sep><sep> It depends on absorbing what is good in the Enlightenment era, where rationality takes precedence over superstition and generalization.<sep><sep> After the resignation of MSM, MMM then without a leader, started its attack against Minister Jeetah and Beebeejaun.<sep><sep> There's a kind of person who is about 5'6, 5'7 like that, and then there's someone with a head and chest that surpasses the rest.<sep><sep> Tenth, the National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers raised this issue at the Human Rights Commission meeting held in Geneva.<sep><sep> All of this together makes their solution even more difficult; I know because I am a professor.<sep><sep> We need to always work on all the tasks proposed in the program, review, political actions on different campaign issues, always focusing on strategic leadership:<sep><sep> We have participated a lot in local government elections of various sizes.<sep><sep> In general, more restrictive sectors have less freedom if all other things are equal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Political parties that choose candidates, who do not know how to read or write English, or even speak it, should be free to appoint someone. <sep><sep> The excuse is that there is a Police Complaints Bureau for that. <sep><sep> Thus, they are releasing some new "rights" just enough to prevent a revolt. <sep><sep> Along with M., MA., we went together to visit and stay with a close family in As-Sawiya, a village in the Salfit district just below a colony (settlement in English and Mustawtani in Arabic). <sep><sep> I will return to the beginning one last time, on nationalism, I asked the following question at the conference, "Why doesn't the working class mobilize people as much as before." <sep><sep> When CNT workers mobilized to defend their rights, then Ministers Baichoo and Mohamed threatened dismissal and repression: Ramgoolam's government threatened to use the police and SMF to counter the workers' mobilization. <sep><sep> They let them through checkpoints to go work in Israel for a week and then return to Palestine. <sep><sep> There is already a political problem where it is a transvestite, but now it is a problem with allegations of sexual abuse in Foyer Namaste, a place where the Minister must educate children. <sep><sep> It is important to emphasize that, under the capitalist system, workers will not have all their rights. <sep><sep> When recounted by the participants, it has even more weight as "eyewitness testimony". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "As my friends from LPT have asked me, I will quickly comment on five poems from this collection, 5 poems you will read today. <sep><sep> Together, they all went to finish playing in Ramgoolam's army. <sep><sep> He was slower than a snail but his taste was excellent. <sep><sep> We searched and searched until we finally understood certain things. <sep><sep> Remember with enthusiasm in our mother tongue because we won't let all our Republic's children grow up because when they leave school they will be measured and reading / writing a thousand times better than now. <sep><sep> They say 'only to make you know that you won't be able to stay here. <sep><sep> And also, the introduction to MPL will "undermine" the rights of these female TUs: Will the police ask a woman on what basis she married before she accuses her husband of beating her? <sep><sep> Our program on Ecology and Environment was launched in October 2003. <sep><sep> He had not yet decided what his Joshwa would do inside the humanity's home. <sep><sep> Therefore, as a lesson and in a form of philosophical reflection on time with a surprise, other reminders come to us <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bra that she received for the election, which is meant for working class women, managers, poor people, would evaporate if it were to sit. <sep> <sep> So, to prevent erosion, there is a terrace work that I think somehow resembles a mirage arranged by artisans in the sugar cane fields of Mauritius (Tonton Kade would be delighted to find those mirages). <sep> <sep> When people are stuck in prison, they do not receive a certificate of morality, they do not get any work, they become a social problem. <sep> <sep> Yannick Jeanne pointed out that the "public spaces" (what they call "plazas") are very lively: there are individuals from various backgrounds participating in different artistic and ministerial activities. <sep> <sep> This is why President Bush chose to hold the AGOA 2003 Forum outside of America and chose to have it here in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> The local bourgeoisie had the classic behavior of a comprador bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> And in the campaign we are conducting, it is evident that it is based on the second evening and what the Sitanese and this government have chosen, they have chosen the first evening. <sep> <sep> There are problems built into this crisis. <sep> <sep> In 1992, after the dismissal of 800 DWC workers by the A.Jugnauth-P.Berenger regime, Rajni Lallah and Ram Seegobin were among the first to advocate for a new labor law PGA: <sep> <sep> So every day, every situation, a different type of support is required. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Rumors are spreading that an attack on the other side of the river took place last week, coming from the village of Jame'en. <sep><sep> Together with the Education for Workers organization, its formal accusation of "genocide" against the government, with very convincing arguments, Lalit has forced the government to change its language policy. <sep><sep> It has declared that the capitalist economic policy is failing today. <sep><sep> Ganga would have a crisis if he were to come and live here for just one day. <sep><sep> And today, as we see French soldiers coming into the country, as we see communalism resurging, as we see forced evictions happening, as we see a desire for a flag over there, and electoral reform happening. <sep><sep> Each of these 62 deputies represents the time elected from his own "community." <sep><sep> - Minutes containing everything that an association wants to keep as its memory; <sep><sep> And these are some of the things that we have discussed extensively in our Strategic Conference on "Mauritianism" and "national unity." <sep><sep> When the Labour Party forms, saying it is fighting for socialism, it is fighting against the capitalists. <sep><sep> Occupation affects families in all economic, social and psychological aspects. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I will not waste your time by telling you in detail all the problems and difficulties we encounter when undertaking a long journey. <sep><sep> He explained the interest that the Zini government has in front-line arms in this kind of military aggression. <sep><sep> On Wednesday evening, LALIT had the pleasure of hosting Ahmed Khan, who, when he returned from Pakistan, became involved in politics as a socialist militant. <sep><sep> "You have value!" In the laws, in the Constitutions, they say something more important in the world, indeed. <sep><sep> For example, his partner MSM may start to break up. <sep><sep> The Government of Mauritius must also start restructuring its economy and production so that we are less dependent on other countries, especially the UK-US. <sep><sep> This march by activists from all corners of the world is an action that will gain even more weight in actions that are currently aimed at forcing governments around the world to stop being complicit. <sep><sep> Just as when the rain falls, the earth seizes up and acts as a semi-automatic pump under the olive trees. <sep><sep> The former MMM-MSM government dismantled more than 8,000 streetlights in the Sugar Industry through VRS1, and now the new government has launched VRS2 to get even more workers to become seasonal workers. <sep><sep> We can say that today, we are in a dilemma on this issue of "Marine Protected Area", what they call "Marine Park". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Similar to how politics have been dominated by Medpoint, the trade union has been dominated by the affairs of Rehana Ameer. <sep><sep> It has been observed that in SIDS where there are 51 representing countries, 37 of them are their own states, while the remaining 14 are not their own states. <sep><sep> The Council had more than half of the representatives being established traders and importers, and the other half functioning as British. <sep><sep> It is said that MMM is no longer controlling extra-parliamentary opposition. <sep><sep> Politicians and parties in the Alliance, all have been in power for the last 32 years: and this law has continued to victimize the people. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, Secretary of the LPT, will appear in the Supreme Court together with the leaders of the FTU trade union federation, where employers are pursuing them for defamation. <sep><sep> Read the article on the pursuit of the Chagossians against the American State, and their Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld (paz 179). <sep><sep> According to the MAI, neither the government nor any citizen can pursue investments. <sep><sep> Yesterday, we saw a range of parties–small, large, average–some that have stopped existing, some that continue to exist, some in Parliament, some not in Parliament. <sep><sep> This, in turn, brings new insights into our campaign for an alternative economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, we have observed that it is a political party. <sep><sep> We greatly appreciate the solidarity expressed by the people who chose to be present in Court yesterday. <sep><sep> He has reasoning, he has thoughts, he has culture. <sep><sep> In the trade union movement, in the trade union struggle, there are 2 types of beasts. <sep><sep> The population was growing, problems were growing, and a great evil was coming to destroy, to cut into pieces, different generations. <sep><sep> This is one of the reasons why LALIT is not going to elections. <sep><sep> We studied the theoretical work of Marx and Engels, the experience gained during the 100 days of the Paris Commune, for example, studying the experiences of different revolutions that have taken place, and we learn from them. <sep><sep> When looking at the question of the Youth Group, Alain Ah Vee presented the Central Committee's position; I (Ram Seegobin) presented a motion for suspension in the Assembly and in the Central Committee. <sep><sep> All this means that it is the economy that is creating other crises, even though this truth is masked by bourgeois ideology, which prefers to pretend that the economic system is perfect, that it prefers to blame the individual. <sep><sep> Everyone prefers to sit and wait for "Waiting for Godot", waiting and waiting to see what the dice will say, instead of getting involved in political action based on debate of ideas, and with a better understanding of the work. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We followed the tears presence from the balcony of The House last night. <sep><sep> The MMM-MSM government is trying to impose the PPP in all sectors. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie seems very satisfied with these 2 laws, which represent a real blow for the working class. <sep><sep> For workers, the right to strike is a fundamental right, and it must be in the Constitution as such. <sep><sep> However, the 27% depreciation has allowed the hotel group to double their profits. <sep><sep> President Uteem has resigned in protest against the Prevention of Terrorism Act. <sep><sep> It is interesting to compare 2000 with 2005 because, for the first time in a long time, there have been 2 elections where the major blocks or small parties allied themselves together (even though there are 2-3 small parties that have changed sides). <sep><sep> Israel has deposed peasants from their land and given it into the possession of the Israeli State; <sep><sep> This was a moment where a member, Pouba Iyasawmy, had this flower to know that the moment was coming. <sep><sep> Until evening, C., S. and I were moving around in the villages to coordinate further action as the tears began to destroy houses in the area. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, they have discovered that there is an underground black hole in Riviere Noire that has been affected. <sep> <sep> Minister Soodhun has vowed to remove workers from Lasinn their permit. <sep> <sep> This is in line with the workers' ideas of entrepreneurship, efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability that reinforce the capitalist ideology. <sep> <sep> 23 billion rupees invested in cane fields, and in the destruction of employment? <sep> <sep> They had a privatization policy that led to the dismissal of low-ranking officers in customs, tax departments, VRAC, MCA, Waste Water, Telecom, and CEB. <sep> <sep> He found a brainwashed Ramou with a mug, happy that Muslim men put it on when they go to the mosque, on his forehead. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin has presented the congress's witness; he began by pointing out that by looking at the LALIT CONGRESS, "Facing ANEW FACE OF IMPERIALISTS, The Party, the Program, the Working Class, and Internationalism." <sep> <sep> He also stated that he would meet with Paul Berenger in the coming week and raise the issue of a potential alliance with MMM, Pravind Jugnauth making a mysterious appearance. <sep> <sep> But, with his hard work, he does not refer to a single entity; he encompasses us or that pure and firm. <sep> <sep> Everyone knows, they say, "It's money that's causing the trouble there." We understand that money has an extraordinary social power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT, we ask, our program, our politics even, is gaining traction. <sep> Today even the operators in the canning industry (which is supposed to have replaced the sugar industry) are saying that this sector is no longer viable, despite all the massive investments and licensing that have already been done. <sep> and Victoria in Novam 2002 followed a call from the Family Liberation Movement. <sep> A new momentum, in this 35-year-old moment. <sep> Through concentration in a sector and decentralization in a country, we have found a way to reduce the weight of bureaucracy. <sep> The SAJ brought this role of leadership to a repressive, authoritarian role. <sep> But the general consensus is that, we have, we can say, in these last 20 years in Mauritius, political parties are breaking away from everyone. <sep> And today the price of diesel on the world market is very low. <sep> And this is partly because of the philosophical punishment that was in place in 2008 when the market was liberalized. <sep> This means that here, when doing CSR here, it is a little different. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For a long time he knew the day when they'd have to put all the cards on the table in order to come. <sep><sep> A union could tell you with good reason, "I'm not in the union to take power, but I'm here to defend my members, I defend the interests of my members". <sep><sep> Recently, there has been radicalization - not just towards the left, but also, it is true, towards the right. <sep><sep> This type of work is now difficult for women and men alike. <sep><sep> In the minds of the great masters, it was all quite clear. <sep><sep> In the face of this crisis, there are 2 ways to address it: <sep><sep> In the last 15 years, it is 30% of its bases outside the State of Zini that have closed. <sep><sep> Where KS members have taken on diplomatic missions to keep political contacts, and it's going well. <sep><sep> We are transitioning towards a dominance of neoliberal politics. <sep><sep> This activity will take place around a wonderful setting; an exhibition with paintings, sculptures and installations on freedom and repression. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are several types of questions raised: practical, philosophical, theoretical, political, and technical questions. <sep><sep> Negotiating is still ongoing and finally the soldiers agreed if the sea marshals raise their passports. <sep><sep> So, its themes are forced to refer to: corruption, incompetence, Medpoint, Mega-scandel, incompetence, government inconsistencies. <sep><sep> But, this infinite man's predation has begun to be arrested by the DSK. <sep><sep> The LALIT program has also received a reasonable share of media coverage - on our entire program, on economic issues often ignored in electoral campaigns, and on sections on environmental issues in our program. <sep><sep> In other words, the National Platform has re-launched the MMM before its First May meeting. <sep><sep> In this process of introducing Creole into Cabinet schools, an orthography and a written grammar were accepted; <sep><sep> But there are also organizations that exist in a similar way with Facebook. <sep><sep> LALIT commissions, their responses, on the one hand, are based on the fact that young and new people who engage for the first time, often have a "single issue" consciousness. <sep><sep> And with ERB Bunware, PS Minister of Labor, there are super-powers that put him in a very strong position vis-à-vis workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are threatening to say that if you do not cooperate with them to bring Plan B, if you do not cooperate with this, then they will bring Plan C, and if you still do not cooperate, then there is a Plan D. <sep> <sep> I go to the market like you, I go to Bagatelle like you. <sep> <sep> He gives the boss power to make female workers go work there alone, then he goes to work, he harasses the woman sexually. <sep> <sep> Transitional demands, they are unifying demands, which form a bridge between today's reality, tomorrow's existence imagination, and a better society's future. <sep> <sep> It is important that we reflect now on how the elections have taken place, and what the results have been, and that we orient our future work. <sep> <sep> Against sexual harassment, and following the testimony of MBC workers. <sep> <sep> They can be making a fuss about energy savings where it is unnecessary, causing workers to mobilize for something that is unnecessary, that does not bring progress at all. <sep> <sep> It is similar to when the government was trying to start a debate on the possibility of reintroducing slavery for people who "voluntarily" want it. <sep> <sep> The question of internationalism is always part of LALIT's actions: it is important to have an international struggle against the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> All colonies are still clearly visible on the colonial roofs with armed watchtowers and military equipment such as light artillery. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I read them for the first time the other day, and right away they have brought Rosa Luxemburg closer to me, making her even closer to my heart than ever before. <sep><sep> in their conspiracy to establish a military base on Diego Garcia, when they have finished carving up the Mauritian land illegally. <sep><sep> On one hand, the intellectuals do not realize that "language" is a NATURAL capacity, so the State is not allowed to become beneficial by imposing, through an education system, a language that children normally speak at home. <sep><sep> a 4.8 magnitude earthquake in the Chagos region, 362 miles from Diego Garcia, where there is an American military base on Mauritian soil. <sep><sep> If we look at the class situation in Mauritius, we will find that the bourgeoisie is very keen between themselves, so these parts need to come up with a populist and demagogic program to win working-class votes. <sep><sep> On the issue of the Trust, it is interesting to note, in passing, that in 1970, there was a Trust concerning the Labour Party. <sep><sep> This means that it does not contribute to the preservation of the planet which threatens human society. <sep><sep> It may allow workers to negotiate collectively vis-a-vis employers, otherwise it will say that each worker will go negotiate for himself. <sep><sep> In the meantime, the independent council, Tirvengadum, has denounced the wastage and corruption in municipalities, and this reminds us of how long the MSM has been engaging in this type of wastage in the Municipality. <sep><sep> This is where this assimilation that I mentioned comes into play. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The end of our program and mobilization that was on Diego/Chagos, Palestine, Creole Language, Campaign for Alternative Economy within a general political framework. <sep><sep> Thus, after the demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt, the hardliners may emerge stronger. <sep><sep> They said that certain capitalists could fit into this "national reconstruction" process, and advocated an alliance between local workers and capitalists against imperialism. <sep><sep> Then use all means to terrorize Palestinian farmers who come to take care of their olive groves or sell their olives. <sep><sep> Struggle for the end of occupation, struggle for a free Palestine depending on how the refugee question will be resolved. <sep><sep> Over the past 2 years, we have developed an international network on this issue. <sep><sep> Today our land is threatened by environmental destruction, war, and barbarism. <sep><sep> There are thoughts because some members of ISM (who were located in Marda for a little while) have left this week. <sep><sep> I have found a job in a field where most women and girls work. <sep><sep> There is no real solution for food security, so there is less dependence on the European market, and not just fighting over millions of square kilometers of sea, and then just giving in to French and Korean ship licenses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another LoveLock prize is causing much debate particularly in the lemon sector.<sep><sep> If he thought he was philosophically valid, he would not have raised the question of the 1983 census. <sep><sep> It's also a ridiculous thing to say in public, and everyone is taking this lemon contentment, like you are regrouping 4 organizations - namely CSG, GWF, FPU and FTU. <sep><sep> In Hares village, there are several underground tunnels for illicit activities that have been implanted in the Burqan industrial zone. <sep><sep> When the time came to separate, Ganga embraced them all and went towards Devi in the end. <sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna have also brought a Kibin cigar that everyone (both smokers and non-smokers) had the opportunity to enjoy! <sep><sep> We said: "GIVE A SOMAZ ALLOCATION", and today the government is making it happen, when it comes with a licensing allocation in its Banks bill, Employment Rights Bill. <sep><sep> Lalit notes that Cancun is arriving at a time when the world's first power, the United States, is in great difficulty as it sinks into a quagmire in Iraq. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, this educator argues that the main reason people can't read/write properly is because they can't see life correctly. <sep><sep> There is a lack of political reference, sometimes a lack of reference in life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then the housing plan today is out of sync with the working conditions and the economic situation in which people find themselves.<sep> But, despite this, as the MCIT chief, Raddhoa himself has gone through this, as they say in English, "unscathed."<sep> He has published articles, the newspaper LALIT, the LALIT DE KLAS Review and the LALIT Review, tracks, leaflets, all-encompassing deep Creole archives, a book of 180 pages in Creole, for example State (2008), Class (2009), The Ut 79 Agreement (1989), Diego Garcia (2002), Against Communalism in the Best Loser System (2005).<sep> When factories close because there is no command, workers have no income, they do not wait, and they buy other products at higher prices, and this leads to other factories closing, more workers without income, they do not wait, etc.<sep> From before they were active in the strikes that erupted in several regions of France.<sep> And very quickly what was called the "Amazon strikes", when young women working in the French zone came down to the street for better working conditions.<sep> LALIT is dreaming! But, Wilbert, he will come and explain to us where in the world there is a base that has managed to close.<sep> This will emancipate the factory workers, teachers, nurses to enter political activism.<sep> But our central problem is how we will manage this program.<sep> This makes it a challenge to impose an ultra-liberal economic policy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> "Zardin Irbin" (urban garden) is something new that has started in Cuba to help them survive after the Soviet Union's collapse, along with a lack of resources. <sep> It is countered by becoming a money farm. <sep> In all this mobilization, many members of LALIT were well involved. <sep> Politically, Medpoint - if one can call it "political" - dominated in 2011. <sep> There were artificial flowers everywhere and after the ceremony, they would gather for another great location. <sep> We can put color back into the burned-out field if we want. <sep> The need to abolish ordinary slavery and replace it with salaried slavery. <sep> It is becoming like what it was together with Eshan Khodabux at the time. <sep> So it's a moment where if we don't address the issue and manage to re-establish and rebuild a new form of political organization, we will all face great danger. <sep> We have realized the cynicism that leads them to break their alliances and cut their alliances. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Descubes has shown that the morality against corruption can be explained by the beliefs of Zezi's era and that today, with modernity, it is outdated. <sep><sep> Some significant amounts (Spain 25% unemployment rate, where the highest is among young people - 51%, Greece 21%, Ireland and Portugal 15%). <sep><sep> And this can be one of the factors that precipitated things. <sep><sep> Even if what Yves is saying is true, and it is, we need to remember that exactly 100 years ago, there were already the same processes. <sep><sep> If you are absent for a day, a cup of tea on your desk. <sep><sep> Because the capitalist economic system is too reckless for creators to think. <sep><sep> Naturally, when there is rationing, those who don't have anything get treated the same as everyone else. <sep><sep> They are invited to a wedding in a small town in the Gondwana region. <sep><sep> Bidze says to increase subsidies for SC and HSC exam fees by 50% on a universal basis, but for targeting, meaning slabs. <sep><sep> Because LALIT (at the time called Lalit de Klas) was the greatest leadership movement in Mauritian history. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday Ken Lay, the President of Enron, formed a party to support President Bush. <sep>
<sep> They took photos and videos to document and show the actions of the army's violent colonization and oppression since the colonial era faced by the people in Palestine. <sep>
<sep> During the campaign, the Social Alliance mobilized votes based on a campaign where they took on two main programs for which LALIT had already mobilized people - universal rights to pensions, village election re-establishment. <sep>
<sep> Let us know if you are interested in participating in the conference and give us an idea of how many delegates are coming. <sep>
<sep> Ram Seegobin then talked about the manner in which, until now, the bourgeoisie's proposals and their political and ideological representatives have room for significant increase. <sep>
<sep> It was helping a lot of people but his family and work were always his first priority. <sep>
<sep> LPT believes that there is truly remarkable work that LALIT has been doing since 1976, even before that during the 2-3 years by MMMSP. <sep>
<sep> Support the people of Palestine against the occupation and colonization by Israel. <sep>
<sep> They do this by blatantly laying patents on seeds to prevent people from using the first harvest for a second crop. <sep>
<sep> An intellectual worker, he has courage in his head. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even the tanker trucks were only getting water a few days a week that needed to be delivered in Afro-Kreol cartie. 
<sep><sep> Lindsey Collen said that only the person who is against that proposal (apart from the establishment that has conservative tendencies everywhere). 
<sep><sep> For this statement to be valid it must also be translated at the national level: meaning that the government must immediately stop all privatization processes of services and social rights. 
<sep><sep> You find Nita Deerpalsing, even Minister Mohamed, even candidate Torul, doing this work for the Working Party, to replace PWU and AGWU in the historic block. 
<sep><sep> But we must be vigilant against any attacks on the Welfare State elements that capitalists and their ideologues have been promoting for some time. 
<sep><sep> PMSD has enjoyed support sometimes overnight, but continues, since Jocelyn Gregoire and other communal groupings have joined it. 
<sep><sep> Mauritius is becoming a capitalist system that will be established for the first time in cities like Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds; this social organization imposed on Mauritius when it is emerging from slavery period, it becomes a model for the big islands invading the countryside of England. 
<sep><sep> Last Tuesday's meeting between Ramgoolam and Berenger, in the presence of Ganoo, Beebeejaun and Sithanen, Berenger made an unacceptable proposal. 
<sep><sep> Here, we have large stores like Pick n Pay, or Shoprite replacing shops on the street corners. 
<sep><sep> It gives ranking by turnover, by profit, by total capital assets, by greatest capital reinforcement in recent years. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They don't have a proposition to change this system. <sep> <sep> Each citizen, without looking behind or in front, is carrying out his daily routine and chores like his ancestors before him. <sep> <sep> MMM - Berenger has proposed an innovative system where the leader of the party is named based on community recommendations. <sep> <sep> Urbanizing neighborhoods and rural areas, which increases the "thermal island effect," resulting in increased energy efficiency in the long term and the recycling of solid and liquid waste. <sep> <sep> Introduction by Rajni Lallah, Conference of the Lalit Party, Tuesday 13th April 2010 <sep> <sep> In the 2010 elections, there was a slight electoral rise, especially in urban areas, but it swept through the countryside. <sep> <sep> Of the 24 opposition members, at the time there were 10 from MMM, 12 from MSM, and 2 from PMSD. <sep> <sep> Furthermore, in the letter Lemond to end the reign of the Israeli state which is acting as a criminal state with the complicity of powerful interests in Europe, in America. <sep> <sep> Apparently, Sithanen seems not to realize that when there is a shortage of food, you cannot rely on plantations and imports yesterday, which are only in the hands of a few. <sep> <sep> Berenger has something absurd to say, then look at the results in the press. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Without a leader after Rodrig, the Social Alliance only has 2/3 of seats in the National Assembly. <sep> <sep> We have submitted a comprehensive file to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture on the need to reorient the economy of Mauritius. <sep> <sep> While developing the Welfare State, we are introducing free education in schools and taking various measures to ensure enough support from working class students so that they are not left behind by the bourgeoisie state. <sep> <sep> An autarkic enterprise will begin to function and replace a capitalist enterprise in a short period of time. <sep> <sep> Since its creation, the PMSD has stated that it is against class struggle. <sep> <sep> According to its own standards, we recognize that the system is a failure through a series of lessons: Its primary level remains very high according to its standards. <sep> <sep> Before independence, there was no Parliament in an independent state. <sep> <sep> In 1983 and 1987, Lalit was a candidate, but in 1991 and 1995, Lalit did not have any candidates, and in 2000 and 2005, we did not have any candidates. <sep> <sep> Neither for energy, nor for food, nor for financial crises. <sep> <sep> It is important for a future, like a note lasting more than 2 terms having a greater international dimension: Diego Garcia military base and Palestinian people's struggle against Israeli military occupation with the complicity of the USA. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Children who learn in their mother tongue in class, learn English and often a third language as well. <sep> When Balram made his request, everyone told him that he would attend two or three times and then break off. <sep> Communication and Me worker and activist, in strategy there is a second aspect: Where are we headed with our ideas? <sep> There is another law that says the same company should do the same work. <sep> The basic problem we are facing is political, it is a problem of social inequality. <sep> Among our publications, there are some that are specifically for activists, aimed at politicizing workers' movements, and there are others that are more for the general public, like newspapers. <sep> The farmer is happy to go gather his wood pile, load it onto a truck, and take it home. <sep> So, we need to understand by what means the law is influencing people. <sep> Reality has led to actions to counter and ridicule the Best Loser system. <sep> And we have maintained a transitional program towards socialism, a program that begins right from where we are today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There has been a wave of resignation in the MSM and measures to make the Jugnauth regime more popular such as granting subsidies on rice-flour and granting licenses to 800 DWC workers. <sep><sep> Therefore, the current government, due to its complicity in repression, will have to pay a political price. <sep><sep> Transcript of the paper presented by Rada Kistnasamy and Rajni Lallah at the strategic seminar LALIT, on 14 September 2012. <sep><sep> There is a humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa, in Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, due to a drought like never before, which is causing famine. <sep><sep> But it also allows the correction of certain negative aspects associated with foreign cultural production, and also allows the valorization of local culture. <sep><sep> 4. Private companies pervert reality by exploiting exploitative relationships. <sep><sep> It is this same system that governs the world of Diego, which we find in the 1st part, offering a game of serpents where there is a better arrangement of desert serpents that Paloma returns home. <sep><sep> Since then in history, there has been an internationalist response against the capitalist system. <sep><sep> I put it into question and went to read about Che, his life, and was impressed by the things Che fought for that were normal and even before I realized. <sep><sep> The Committee said "not expressing any concerns about the electoral system most appropriate for the [Mauritian] State, or reports from the State." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But before we talk about money, let me address one thing first. <sep><sep> The issue of climate change, he said, poses a significant crisis in the future. <sep><sep> He continues to talk about the "resilience" that Mauritius supposedly has. <sep><sep> When there's a problem in Lazi, there's a very serious problem bubbling up due to climate change, leading to a shortage of rice. <sep><sep> Today, with the massive land licenses that it has, it needs to be implemented much earlier than previously planned, with more than 60,000 hectares. <sep><sep> Samy refused because he had already taken legal action against them for damages. <sep><sep> But the more severe dynamics that the motion of Armance and debate on this motion are provoking, is putting pressure for a communal classification of Mauritian people, which has never been seen before. <sep><sep> It's not a force where you're putting force against each individual in a coercive way. <sep><sep> Everyone was there for a meal in solidarity. <sep><sep> -Why are they allowing the establishment to reduce its contribution through VRS instead of forcing it to diversify to create more jobs? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Replace the term "General Population" in the Mauritian Constitution with "Creoles and other Christians". <sep><sep> If we were to tell the boss, "Abe, give us our salary increase, give us Rs3,000 per month." <sep><sep> It's not just a matter of who is the President, who is the Secretary of a federation? <sep><sep> And, in what is being proposed, there is no mechanism that guarantees a majority, when nominations are based on proportional representation. <sep><sep> He mentioned that Arafat was experiencing pain in his stomach and the Court had to send a doctor to examine him. <sep><sep> We can contrast our idea of "economy" with theirs. <sep><sep> It should be highlighted that before 2005, before the general election, Lalit had begun reflecting and working towards an alternative to the sugar and cane industry. <sep><sep> on our position on the abolition of subsidies on SC and HSC examinations as well as on the way we are building a national and international platform against military bases such as Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Therefore, in LALIT, we maintain that the government's legal policy is an indication of its ideological orientation. <sep><sep> Because we all share a passion for freedom, along with the artists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the economic crisis in Mauritius, the country's economy was heavily dependent on sugar, and almost all necessities were imported due to the depreciation of the local currency. <sep><sep> - When the police are involved in a death, the autopsy must be carried out by an independent doctor to ensure a fair investigation. <sep><sep> 1. We have seen difficulties for movements of protesters, even though they are peaceful, and they seem to be gaining victories, expressing an alternative political system to capitalism. <sep><sep> In an economic crisis, when Bidze appears on TV on May 22, the issue of official language in Parliament becomes a reality. <sep><sep> • For a constitution and more democratic control over a government: a Speaker, Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers elected by Parliament, and subject to recall by Parliament. <sep><sep> The resistance of the Palestinian people against the Israeli military occupation since 1967, the 1st Intifada in 1987 and the 2nd Intifada in 2000, resistance against military occupation. <sep><sep> It was in 1999 that UNESCO declared this international day. <sep><sep> - Poor Balram, he will be shocked when he sees my face. <sep><sep> He didn't even bother to answer their petition. <sep><sep> The MSM used its boat the Sun Trust to expand its party, have its own members, and even leased offices to the government between 1991 and 1995. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But when the post office got a little bit busy, I decided to go look elsewhere. <sep><sep> However, after this the police put a series of charges on J.M.Richard. <sep><sep> Writers, editors and activists of the Mauritian Creole language, namely Vidya Golam, Sedley Assonne, Lindsey Collen, Rama Poonoosamy, Pushpa Lallah, Alain Ah-Vee and Alain Muneean have decided on a comment. <sep><sep> Now, we need to see what means we have to do this. <sep><sep> And it seems that the SIDS Conference in Mauritius represents an attempt to exert pressure for special treatment and derogations for small island states in the WTO. <sep><sep> So, when we say that LALIT is in solidarity with this movement to expose the barbaric system of "Israeli military justice", we know from personal testimony. <sep><sep> This has been a long-term plan, and it is a bit of a pattern to follow its initiatives. <sep><sep> The other green card (the Palestinian one) must show ID to all passengers to pass. <sep><sep> But this 19% increase is applicable to all companies that did not participate in these negotiations. <sep><sep> And even though there was some work involved, it is not much when you consider the amount of work, effort, creativity and love from these activists who have written articles in this book. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often, when we use nursery rhymes produced in a foreign cultural context, we unknowingly transmit elements of that culture inconsistently. <sep> Some countries with few resources, but where religious law is supreme, such as Iran and Pakistan, for example, are very important. <sep> Cindy Clelie, who chaired the Press Conference, said that in an economic crisis situation, the Opposition is suffering from a serious crisis. <sep> Everyone who knows this story knows that I am not exaggerating. <sep> He now says that the Best Loser system should remain, as long as there is an electoral reform that "includes" minority communities, especially Muslims and Sino-Mauritians, he says. <sep> The work presupposes a first matter too, a cause for example, and it presupposes a machine in the lye. <sep> If the results were positive, it would naturally be all the greater. <sep> We are in this Conference to question the concept of 'Mauritianism' and to evade its content itself. <sep> But, I also thought it might be more interesting to commemorate this strike movement by looking at its progress in relation to the fundamental principles that govern all strikes. <sep> They stopped talking about Balancy all of a sudden. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As one part, if we want to investigate this classroom situation, then ask the teacher, what do we do? <sep><sep> He has already done that course before, and it was a session. <sep><sep> A general strike requires much more preparation than this if it is to be effective. <sep><sep> • For Parliament (Legislator) to have more control over the executive: limit the number of Ministers (no more than 15 Ministers in a Parliament of 104 deputies). <sep><sep> And, we are finding that this crisis is extending beyond the continental framework, and affecting countries such as Asia, Brazil, and even China. <sep><sep> Ramesh Khaytoo's contribution to the conceptualization and organization of a strike in 1970. <sep><sep> In recent times, the population of Mauritius has doubled since Independence, so the Parliament needs to expand only to meet the needs. <sep><sep> He wants to say you are finding a "political struggle", exactly how the MMM, PT, PMSD, MSM, Smart Party, etc believe it is, and you are finding trade union struggles such as Subron and Bizlall. <sep><sep> But as a general phenomenon in this production system, everything the working class produces, because it is appropriated by property license, by company license, it alienates from the worker. <sep><sep> Are they paying it enough or not paying it enough. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As we were entering the land reserved for workers to start developing this consciousness, this necessity to develop concrete solidarity with the working class in South Africa. <sep><sep>
The PMSD was still promoting communal politics through events like the Creole Festival that X.Duval was organizing when he was Minister of Tourism, and where this element of identity was predominant. <sep><sep>
All these questions you raise as a worker here. <sep><sep>
More than 20 times Lalit emphasized the need to rethink the future decisively. <sep><sep>
But this is not enough to let it have a say today, especially in a crisis period. <sep><sep>
We will explain a little the way we see the launch of these elections and their political significance from our point of view. <sep><sep>
Doesn't President Obama know that Palestine is under Israeli military occupation? <sep><sep>
We don't only know what he wanted to say about the best loser, because it was in a private meeting, and his position is not clear in public. <sep><sep>
When he found out for the first time that Kamini was winning, he was shocked. <sep><sep>
He explained how Palestinians in Gaza are suffering Israeli military attacks in 3 ways: ground forces are attacking them, planes are bombing them, and they are also being bombed by naval vessels in the sea. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The camp was so surrounded by police officers that no one else could enter the camp <sep><sep> Boolell is positioning himself as a great leader of the PT, and Berenger, for his part, is accepting him as a Workers' leader. <sep><sep> And as individuals, every individual, we are here too, we are also exposed to the dominant ideology. <sep><sep> the leader of the Workers' Party and Prime Minister, Navin Ramgoolam, and the head of the La Sentinelle group, Jean Claude de L'Estrac. <sep><sep> But, from that day on, for 10-20 years, all the men of Bambous were protesting against the camp, the police station. <sep><sep> Josian Labonté explained how Caritas carries out literacy courses in some parts of the country. <sep><sep> You will find a long history, over many years, and it was the main source of revenue. <sep><sep> This means that the MSM finds itself outside the classes), MMM and Workers have a more "pro-worker", "socialist", etc discourse, when they have been regaining power for several decades by different bourgeois sectors. <sep><sep> It is a government that imprisons the lobbies of identity groups. <sep><sep> In Court, when the police went into the box, the interrogation room, they imprisoned 2 men: they didn't want to admit they had beaten the woman, and they didn't want to admit they had been fighting with the woman. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He sent to the United Nations with the international law, he secretly died in the country illegally, keeping the goal always in mind, and with a determination to eradicate the population from all corners of the Chagos by force. <sep><sep> When a truck crosses, it doesn't make it easy to pass. <sep><sep> Its major advancement is to accuse the government, not only blocking children who do not perform well in schools, like many others, including many in the past; Unity has also accused the government of blocking the development of all children. <sep><sep> On the basic question, they say we will review it later. <sep><sep> He also spoke with Frei Beto, an advisor to the Lula government in Brazil, in Vienna on the type of unity that needs to be brought today to ensure equality and justice in the world. <sep><sep> He has not succeeded in making this dream a reality, but he will surely start paying the penalty well. <sep><sep> Citronella Land was the last step for Princess Prathna, before she entered the infested nest of Samazeste Toupoumwa and Lord Toutouk Touni. <sep><sep> Then, the government is named a family in this post. <sep><sep> In the final part of the Seminar, there will be a launch of the new edition of Henri Favory's poem "BEF" which is still very popular in the world of LPT literature. <sep><sep> So, there it is, this shows how fast our yellow route has to go, how much we have to think. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But with this new alliance MMM-MSM-PMSD, it was foreseen to bring a greater level of decentralization to the regional administration: they did not express any willingness to give more democratic rights and decision-making power to the people. <sep><sep> and the transformation of agricultural products for export and local consumption for the development of a renewable energy industry. <sep><sep> This summit precisely shows that the fight against maternal languages has been ongoing, there is a strong urge to lead this system. <sep><sep> The government is saying that there is a need to plant and intercrop legumes and other products in this large area. <sep><sep> It also addresses the various forms of sexual assault that occur in the workplace where the assaulter takes advantage of their authoritative power. <sep><sep> As soon as you sign the contract and start looking for another job. <sep><sep> Reduction in sugar production is threatening the existence of even the largest sugar cane plantations and refineries. <sep><sep> There are vacancies for work, there are jobs available, but courage is needed to find them. <sep><sep> * For Medical professionals and journalists: Among others, 2 speeches by JUSTICE and MLF have been presented, by Ram Seegobin and Jean Claude Bibi, where they have exposed the roles of medical professionals and the press. <sep><sep> How can a doctor ensure that their profession is not involved in concealing torture? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In order for Mauritius to be able to initiate proceedings to place a case in front of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to obtain an '"advisory opinion" on the Chagos demand, <sep><sep> Today, the main goal that the working class movement is leading towards is political power. <sep><sep> There's no sight, but it will start, it says, especially to put that there. <sep><sep> After LALIT did not take offense at this statement, it seemed empty and confused. <sep><sep> - Why are they discouraging people from growing food crops? <sep><sep> like a sole "calf," and like the foliage of a single interdependent system. <sep><sep> (Remember the life of an olive tree it counts hundreds of years.) <sep><sep> We will betray them if we do not pass this experience on to the upcoming generations. <sep><sep> movements like the degreg committee, solidarity committee, those who carry the struggle, to strengthen them, to strengthen these fighters, it asks for a political process. <sep><sep> If we look at the security industry, it was the largest work sector in the '70s. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is deliberately provoking a sentencing snowball of police brutality and communal discrimination, unleashing all kinds of counter-attacks, abuses, and even jokes. <sep><sep> Today, there is also a substantial increase in textile layoffs as well as in certain hotels due to the global recession affecting many people directly and indirectly. <sep><sep> This is how it can defend its union leader (Telecom) and stop (Air Mauritius) with dignity. <sep><sep> In the face of the Israeli military aggression against the Lebanese people and the inhabitants of Gaza, it is necessary that we express our solidarity with the victims of this war. <sep><sep> - Isn't it sad? - Sad? - Yes, sad. <sep><sep> After the general election on 5 May, it is an opportunity for us to focus our attention on an electoral campaign, a very short campaign marked by even more electoral corruption by the 2 main alliances. <sep><sep> Alain explained that the work of the Septam neighborhood in 1980 was based on working-class leadership, and this movement attracted students, the unemployed, and families, while today, in this downturn we are experiencing. <sep><sep> There are also other services that could have been organized by the municipality and that could have served the people at night, such as a social center where there isn't one, a municipal canteen, laundry, and washing machines. <sep><sep> Another auditorium said that literacy apprenticeship in Creole has allowed him to write plays, something he would never have had the confidence to do in another language. <sep><sep> They also did work to establish a boycott on the sale of products and companies that need to be boycotted. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, the levels of perversion nowadays (a cover of public immorality, while the other side is too explicit to expose) have reached new heights. <sep><sep> This session that my friend Rajni and I are presenting, it is about the class politics that are neither electoral nor civil society. <sep><sep> Is it possible to have parliamentary elections and democracy in Palestine under military occupation? <sep><sep> He couldn't read or write when he joined LALIT, so he learned literacy with Education for Workers in a course in Baitka, Bambous. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy took part in anti-military base protests in Okinawa and Tokyo, Japan. <sep><sep> Sometimes without using words, they were communicating their pain, sadness, and hope. <sep><sep> It is a good thing that the use of Creole language in schools has become a serious debate on education. <sep><sep> However, its system is facing its second major crisis. <sep><sep> Using Diego to defend the interests of the bourgeoisie, particularly in textiles. <sep><sep> When we talk of decriminalizing abortion, what we are saying is that abortion is not a matter concerning the police, it is not a matter concerning the courts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In terms of politics, Lalit has come out to strengthen the capacity of our members to meet the current demands with a deep understanding, through dynamics in transitional demands. <sep><sep> We are moving forward with a charter of demands that brings unity to all women and leads to our emancipation. <sep><sep> Lenin said the working class, having a capacity to act in its own interest as a class, will, nonetheless, most of the time rely on the exemplary actions of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> there were all sorts of deceptive opposition that were "ulterior" actioneers, crying "we must do something." And we had to do something. <sep><sep> Today, lalit, which we are taking to a new level, we must realize that to bring about true development in the economy, in society, we must have a CONSCIOUS political struggle. <sep><sep> So, we must denounce capitalist exploitation there. <sep><sep> it seems that the class struggle has become an abstract, intellectual matter, and at the same time Ram says it involves the environment, education, health, economy, the daily life of all people. <sep><sep> Here in Barcelona, where we find organizations that are present, we sit in the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> And thus, this campaign can continue to develop into a movement based on a program that will be enriched by the participation of people from different sectors and backgrounds. <sep><sep> In terms of the Kreol language, this year is historic, as the Government has accepted an orthography and a grammar, and has trained a first batch of 70 teachers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is another form of classroom, and it is more political. <sep><sep> But the child floating the paper boat, he is also conscious, amused he floats it, transcending the complications that life experiences represent. <sep><sep> And because beneath the surface of the game there are snakes, and after each finished level a snake ladder awaits to bring people like Paloma on the top. <sep><sep> This climb ensures the reproduction of a class society, a society where inequality and injustice prevail. <sep><sep> It began by explaining how the former Prime Minister Berenger gave the first sign that there was a serious economic and social crisis: changing the way they calculate the unemployment rate to make sure it doesn't appear too high. <sep><sep> Friday morning 10.30 a.m., there will be the launch of the electronic LPT dictionary, online and interactive on the website www.kiltir.com. <sep><sep> * I met a man in the women's society who is also an activist in the anti-miray movement. <sep><sep> Did you vote so that this gentleman would take an interest in those who work hard for us? <sep><sep> since his birth itself, why does he denounce the call to the international capitalist system, especially providing sophisticated red wine through Language, then Europe. <sep><sep> In other words, we are also reserving our reflective capacity for two dominant languages, which are not the languages of the Mauritian children. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a special invitation on Wednesday, April 16 at Orl LPT, GRNW for a "Political Education" session organized every 15 days by Professor Mike Cole from LALIT. <sep><sep> With strong design, it will simply be a mere 36% reduction then it will become stable again. <sep><sep> It was said that his work was going well because he used to take care of his clients who would not let him down. <sep><sep> Today, US Embassy officials are distributing candies to NGOs and civil society members. <sep><sep> The representative of Levese was pleased with the questions on philosophy and practical implications proposed for the improvement of education through the cities. <sep><sep> Fourthly, this is an attack on the universal right to a "Welfare State". <sep><sep> We have decided not to support any candidates in the 2010 elections mainly for 2 reasons: <sep><sep> One participant asked why people are so greedy today. <sep><sep> This means there is a class inequality, families with means can go to countries with legal work, while poorer families in the working class risk their health and even death because of illegal work. <sep><sep> He and his wife walked a mile to get to a main road to catch a service to go to Checkpoint Huwara and later take another service to go to the hospital in Nablus. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, this Manifesto has less content on class, less anti-imperialist content, less content in favor of women's emancipation, compared to the traditional parties that they criticize! <sep><sep> In a LALIT seminar on November 2, 2012, Ram Seegobin raised the question, "Does the Current Government Reign in the Interests of the Class?" <sep><sep> The "Political" in its lesson, which says for the first time that the reform is not strictly economic. <sep><sep> and it is considered a 'colonized' mind if it asks, "Is my language inferior to your language?". <sep><sep> How will LALIT, however it will grow, however it will develop? <sep><sep> But it is more difficult for Dharam Raj and Fanfan Tabardenn to agree even if secretly each had a little admiration for their rival. <sep><sep> There was an accompaniment of ravans, and ravans with maravans. <sep><sep> At the same time, our strength is to affect the balance of class forces, for example, by force of other parties, even pro-bourgeois, adopting certain measures in favor of the working class. <sep><sep> The law accompanies it with a police system; and a military system. <sep><sep> The police were instructed to "insult the police" against Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the classroom, there should be more practical work for students to learn to write texts from their own observations on what happens in their work or in the countryside where they live. <sep><sep> If Mauritius depends too much on the tourist industry when the textile and sugar sectors are declining, it becomes overly dependent on a single sector and a fragile sector. <sep><sep> Small-scale planters (who are the backbone of the PT-Alliance in every village, with a strong social base), cooperative sugarcane movements, insurance industry workers (such as Jugdambi and Rima, typically). <sep><sep> They have been called by all sorts of names, they are mocked, criticized for their physical appearance. <sep><sep> And in a press statement, Ally Hosenbokus said that he is not Paul Berenger, leader of the MMM political party, who will decide if there will be a by-election or not. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Independence Day celebrations are getting the people of Mauritius accustomed to the presence of French soldiers in the country. <sep><sep> we also published a document about the Pied Piper of Hamelin on our website. <sep><sep> Since the beginning, they chose to include the term "Mauritian" in their name. <sep><sep> Destructive internal relationships between men and family have become more intense, as have internal family relationships in general. <sep><sep> Because today we need to look at all the great analysts who existed in the past from which we can learn: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here, Jeff Lingaya made a wealth ladder.
<sep> Overall, those who were disadvantaged, like those who were at the bottom, as they climbed up to the top those who had remained at the bottom of their luck were getting hit at the same time they were getting hit together.
<sep> In LALIT, we criticize politics, it has criticized the bourgeois parties because they represent the interests of different sections of the bourgeoisie and they do not question the logic of the capitalist economic system.
<sep> It is an ideological scaffolding, a blindfold, an opportunistic form that intends to face the true difficulties of communalism, true difficulties of racism present in Mauritius.
<sep> Precarious industrial workers who labor, who are artisans, when they have to take a paper goal, they treat it as a paper goal, and when they have to get a little mud on their shoes, they stop working.
<sep> Last Friday, in a heavy rain, a group of LALIT members participated in a "dignified and peaceful" demonstration.
<sep> The Palestinian authorities are too far away to address everyday problems faced by people at the local level.
<sep> How many members do you currently have, what level of organization do you have, what financial resources do you have, and what will you do with all this.
<sep> The commercial and industrial protection of the textile industry in Mauritius has disappeared since the end of 2004, and factories continue to close, and workers continue to suffer from layoffs.
<sep> So, how can you believe that I am accusing destiny or a full person, or do you accuse other people? <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But that hope that he had, why am I calling it ridiculous because it rests on a total ignorance, a criminal ignorance, of what foreign policies of Great Britain were. <sep> <sep> He's being dragged back to a point, like someone drowning, even if it's a minor point, it's a dangerous one. <sep> <sep> Timi, after he had spoken with Balram, decided to invite Celimène-Kamla to marry him. <sep> <sep> In other words, it wants to find a democratization which is also on an election level. <sep> <sep> A revolt - even if it has come after it - people have managed to do it. They succeeded in mobilizing. <sep> <sep> But, many people seemed to have split their vote between candidates in the two blocks. <sep> <sep> The trade union movement, he said, is clearly and certainly concerned because the focus of our campaign is on job creation. <sep> <sep> Frankly speaking, he is only "weakening" those who are laughing, not giving them pensions. <sep> <sep> In this first wave of bourgeois development - it began before Independence and continued after Independence - there were very specific methods regarding the economy as it was. <sep> <sep> They said it clearly, it's 'Hold on Timi' and not Balram that they trust. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The time (horror) The economic crisis has worsened during this period of economic crisis. <sep><sep> It is not the first time since 1982 that Lalit has not had a candidate in an election. <sep><sep> And if we look at the Mwayen Az, we will see that there are constant relationships between the Churches and the Governments. <sep><sep> He had asked Sami to call Father Martin King who had arrived much later. <sep><sep> The capitalist class interests are an obstacle to peace and reunification of the Mauritian territory. <sep><sep> Moreover, at the time, when we informed the police for the second series of 3 slides, Pointe aux Piments, Kalbas and Triolet, the police had categorically banned our protest, just as the Anti-Drug Movement was banned, but under the old law. <sep><sep> Ex-Prime Minister Harold Wilson told us it was "just a simple communication station." <sep><sep> When the pretext of "Communism" failed, then it became "protecting the petroleum routes." <sep><sep> (I did not get into the question of the differences in the MMM and MSM Historical Bloc, except for a brief past, but they can read a bit about that on our website if they are interested. <sep><sep> To do this, we need to have what is called a revolutionary patience. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But sometimes we forget propaganda, the amount of means that the bourgeoisie puts in place, to block the emergency consciousness of the class, class unity. <sep><sep> We must recognize that it was well prepared mentally and physically for this great event. <sep><sep> We have chosen this theme of freedom because it is a central issue in the history of humanity. <sep><sep> Because of this, it took into account everything that his husband was doing; he even learned how to drive the sales. <sep><sep> He has told many times that he has been to Palestine, and this is what allows him to witness how the Israeli State is militarily occupying Palestine. <sep><sep> There are also members of Happy World who are pursuing Education for Workers, an organization close to the Lalit party, because this member does not agree with the FTU union critiquing it. <sep><sep> Nuclear energy is actually in the sense that it does not emit greenhouse gases. <sep><sep> At the same time, we will look at how mobilization has been taking place since before the demonstration succeeded in expressing precisely this anger, this revolt against injustice. <sep><sep> And they are very rare to say exactly WHEN this trend will materialize. <sep><sep> a certain concert in a cafe called Tana Arts Cafe and another concert in the Carlton hotel hall where the public was invited. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Suddenly, he said, it is useful for us to do this exercise with our history because there are new members present who did not live at that time, some have not lived through it at all, and for other members it is a rediscovery of our appreciation of our own history. <sep><sep> On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the dedication to the Worker and 30 years of progress of the mother tongue in Mauritius, there will be a conference to celebrate "Mother Tongue: For Freedom, Against Repression". <sep><sep> Our workers have built such confidence between themselves. <sep><sep> Worse, the leaders of the PT also make people believe that Mauritius can face the global economic crisis. <sep><sep> Question: What motivated you to choose these two themes? <sep><sep> We have also studied the communal dynamics that such reforms bring. <sep><sep> This pursuit exposes the link between the military, State Secretaries, private company CEOs who run military bases, and elected politicians. <sep><sep> There was a possibility that a boss could not fire a worker for just interrupting his service time, when he went on strike for the first time. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna asked the gentleman if he had a daughter. <sep><sep> The Zini Nation Committee Decision has come to expose the fact that in the RA complaint, they do not take a position against the Best Loser, but instead support the Committee that the Best Loser System will continue to be beautiful and good. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to Section 49 of the Constitution "The official language of the National Assembly is English, but any member can speak in French". <sep> And what is the ordinary meaning of the expression "class struggle". <sep> Where will we end up in this unstable world? But when the ball started rolling after the death of the former king and the coronation of Toupoumwa and especially when Toutouk Touni became Prime Minister, Banndouk's followers did not hesitate. <sep> The resignation of MSM and attacks on MSM have also led to the resignation of Aneerood Jugnauth as President of the Republic. <sep> Now in press conferences, and in general, resignations are being presented as victims. <sep> What they call the League, it is not a real League at all, in it there are powerful countries, which act as imperialist forces, like France and Germany, and then there are countries stronger than Greece, Portugal. <sep> Rada Kistnasamy spoke specifically about all the advantages that the state has created and argued that it makes it seem as if sugar and textiles are more profitable. <sep> e.g. by sitting 30 deputies on a proportional basis, Pravind Jugnauth is speaking 10. <sep> Arundhati Roy says the Central Government of Lend is leading a war against the most miserable people like the Dalits, and all the tribal people and a genocide of the population of Kashmir. <sep> As you can see, there is work being done behind the scenes by Nirmal Hurry and his team, where they have installed the kokoa, a natural occurrence with balloons -- a plastic affair -- underestimated. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During 2004, there were several internal conflicts within the Government. There were conflicts between MMM, MMM, and MSM, especially after the Partial Elections in the North. <sep> If there were two, different countries would be able to play one against the other. <sep> As the current system is, voters at polling stations can identify individuals who come to vote either for a second time or under a different name. <sep> It will be interesting to see what will happen in the Municipalities. <sep> Just as women have exposed DSK, in Mauritius, we need to expose men who dominate women. <sep> It would be considered immoral and revolting if the government, under pressure from big capitalists involved in the huge IRS project, St Felix/Bel Ombre, allows them to dump waste into the sea. <sep> Decentralized power could make development that fits reality more feasible than widespread programs. <sep> It is also said that the Church has Excommunication for its members who do not follow its commandments, so why does the State need to become another punitive body? <sep> And it is this which has ultimately led to the consumption of more herbicides and pesticides in our food. <sep> We are actively working towards mobilizing for an alternative economic policy that is in the interest of all those who need to work to live. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Currently, Roland Fozoo works as a security guard in the construction sector where there is no peace in his absence. <sep><sep> Today, in Palestine, there are Israeli-occupied colonies scattered throughout Palestinian territory. <sep><sep> We are witnessing a growing interest in learning "Creole as a Foreign Language" for individuals from other countries who want to learn to speak Creole. <sep><sep> Researchers have shown that it takes 12 years of life to develop cognitive capacity, reflection, and critical thinking. <sep><sep> Between the first and second parts of the session, we all shared a great meal prepared with care by Comrade Georges. <sep><sep> You can contact us if you would like to receive a copy of the program. <sep><sep> In the movement in America to repatriate American soldiers from Iraq and military bases. <sep><sep> And one will notice that in the last 10 years, when the capitalist system is evolving, even the great capitalists, economists, and bourgeois economists, they all turn to Karl Marx. <sep><sep> We need to encourage local production in order to build the nation and nurture import substitution. <sep><sep> It is a strict rule that everyone is recognizing in the case of industrial sectors, it has been properly cleaned. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The same people who have spent 12 years learning English and French in school cannot spend 12 seconds to learn how to read Mauritian Creole quickly? <sep><sep> WHO HAS BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL TO A BETTER VOTING PER DISAGREEMENT 39%? <sep><sep> And when there is a systemic crisis, it means a mistake in exemplarity. <sep><sep> Work was not lacking but everything was going smoothly as if by a miracle. <sep><sep> with his gadgets, flag, pavilion, large photo, banners, base, superficial debates, storytelling, arm-wrestling, making a good woman arm-wrestle in front of the camera, smiling, giving a soldier a gun, pumping, causing or getting bruises, insecurities which that part must be able to "fix", etc. <sep><sep> The lawyer asks the Court not to take the confession into consideration. <sep><sep> Labor Day celebrations were held in Horl Mama Bul Later on May 1st. <sep><sep> Our experience in literacy, over 30 years, teacher training, is another extraordinary strength. <sep><sep> This is a second section in the working class, after artisans that it also affects, but not in an identical way. <sep><sep> This is a second thing that a political program for a party like LALIT gives us, is that it gives us a vision of a totality; a political vision in its totality. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (a) We must not delay in giving time and space for reactions, as Dev Virahsawmy has said, for them to mobilize to block the introduction of the Mauritian Creole language in schools. <sep><sep> But back then, we weren't even Morisyan nationals? <sep><sep> We are publishing a transcription of a speech made by Ram Seegobin in a LALIT members' meeting on 31st August, 2013. <sep><sep> But without integrating bureaucracy, it seems they have taken into account the fact that there is a vast majority at times against what they are saying. <sep><sep> When you just put a blade in a valley, and it's supplied by a small river. <sep><sep> Further in my speech, we will find that this is not a coincidence. <sep><sep> You can contact us to get a copy of the program (call 208 5551). <sep><sep> What you want to say is that you want to buy a toaster for Rs435, then after 2 weeks it stops working, and when you go to the store, they say "yes we can repair it, it will cost you Rs 600". <sep><sep> I am losing myself: because I have had a child and since 24 years that I have been in Mauritius, it has never been recognized as a Mauritian. <sep><sep> Among the scientists who have kept this tradition alive, if anyone wishes to read their work, there was Stephen Jay Gould, who wrote absolutely fantastic and easy-to-read books. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Colin Powell, US Secretary of State: There is a connection with the company America Online, Gulfstream. <sep>
<sep> We find that there is a labor movement, but we realize that the labor movement, by its very nature, exists in relation to the employer. <sep>
<sep> Rada Kistnasamy has said that Lalyans Sosyal is providing passive support to Pravind Jugnauth. She said that Lalyans Sosyal has chosen to abstain because it will have difficulty defending its economic policy model in crisis. <sep>
<sep> She doesn't understand why the soldiers have stopped at Huwara checkpoint, why they had to get off the bus and walk behind them. <sep>
<sep> They preferred to appease the boss of Zonn Frans even if the factory is to close down. <sep>
<sep> Remember how in the first phase of the revolt when Kaya died in Alcatraz in February 1999, people in urban areas attacked the police station, released prisoners from Grand Rivyer Prison and attacked other symbols of the State, until its public panel. <sep>
<sep> There, life has become extra difficult for us; what will happen to us? <sep>
<sep> Mr. Servina, director of SIITE ("Small Islands Institute for Transformation and Empowerment" based in Seychelles), also expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people. <sep>
<sep> But in the current context, we do not have the right to speak on this issue because the country is under establishment, and the establishment does not want diversification. <sep>
<sep> In the class struggle, the way we find it today, is deeply rooted in reality. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This involves how it starts and what people know, not just language, but culture, tradition, family, and all their experiences outside of school. <sep> <sep> Today in Mauritius, when a person is facing difficulties to make ends meet. <sep> <sep> You get this kind of thing at work today. <sep> <sep> This is what has brought about some progress, but more is needed. <sep> <sep> Invisible measures like when they have depressed prices to allow the boss to make big "gains" on the backs of workers and poor people. <sep> <sep> It is necessary because it always represents an ideological agenda, it improves the quality of life, but only, through it does not resolve inequality issues, it does not resolve central problems. <sep> <sep> We predicted this and it has become true. <sep> <sep> The role of women in Palestine and in Israel will play a determining role in what will happen in Palestine and in Israel. <sep> <sep> Around the Cambrian period, there were several important planets and a tiny insignificant planet called Gondwana where all the powers were in the hands of a great musician-artist called Kontu but there were people who believed that his true name was Gondwana. <sep> <sep> This will be a political program, just like the political parties do, and we find its importance when there is a political exhibition on strong bases as we have today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The strategic seminar on 2nd November was a strategic seminar focused on the bourgeois state and historical blockade. <sep><sep> (Laughter.) So when it comes to "capacity to pay", you're fooling people because in principle, the boss will say he can't pay. <sep><sep> In the Central Committee of LALIT, every 15th of the month when we meet, a member prepares what we call a "horizon tour", and we do this alternately. <sep><sep> Where there is more voice-and-ink, the rifle is less. <sep><sep> Today, Ashok Subron in the newspaper is offering to negotiate with the government. <sep><sep> On 27th December 2009, it will mark exactly a year since Israel bombed and invaded Gaza. <sep><sep> The organization in which it is known as the South-South Exchange Programme in the History of Development. <sep><sep> and the sorrow of the Chagosians as a village grenade for them supporting the detonzant, for them pulling benefits from Angle, benefits from Americans, for the profit of the private sector of Mauritius, that is to say, for them to pay the background politics. <sep><sep> We start with the Central Committee Report, then we discuss in detail among the themes addressed in the Report. <sep><sep> One day Princess Prathna heard that the boy's cousin was very sick. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the day that SILU took the decision to withdraw his case from the IRC, that day, we all knew, we were heading towards the strike. <sep><sep> He is a constant in Jack Bizlall's long political and union career, this confusion that he has in his head between the trade union movement and the political movement. <sep><sep> this permanent conflict within the capitalist system, he keeps it in a state of permanent agitation; <sep><sep> That is, the bourgeoisie of the state becomes an opposition to the historical bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Over the years, a certain credibility has developed in the trade union movement based on its program. <sep><sep> Secondly, some days ago, a front was formed, supposedly to challenge the IPPs, that is the Independent Power Producers, firms that produce electricity. <sep><sep> You can be your own courage at work. <sep><sep> So, today in 2010, workers all over the world are revolting. <sep><sep> The editorial may have a bias for privatization and liberalization (as L'Express has), or for the MMM (as Week-End has), or for "civil society" (like Le Mauricien has). <sep><sep> It's a demand that people make when they haven't thought through enough. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Western countries, such as the US, UK, and France, abstained. <sep> <sep> There was an office in the rabbit hole, called Autar, where we had to sign to enter. <sep> <sep> Individuals who made the greatest contribution to understanding the history of life (a life that we now know has been around for 4 billion years) were Charles Darwin, who was writing at the same moment as Malthus, Marx, and Engels. <sep> <sep> - 'Don't move! I'm going to open it.' Sami returns to Dharam Raj. <sep> <sep> And when the system is in crisis, many people in the middle class easily slip into the lower class, they find themselves without work, in many difficulties, and the working class grows. <sep> <sep> - Only the committee can say if the State can submit a candidate, if the State justifies before the Committee why it has not carried out a census since 1972. <sep> <sep> The social alliance is talking about foreign investment FDI, but rather it is an investment through IRS that has been available and this equivalent to a landslide in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> You can read this example in my novel published last year, The Malaria Man & Her Neighbors. <sep> <sep> What I do not understand is why the newspapers, radio, and media in general in the world never, or very rarely, show and explain what a checkpoint is. <sep> <sep> It does not help to develop this necessary class consciousness among workers and all oppressed people to confront the capitalist and its system with its State. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the Palestinian people are not just sharing this optimism of President Abbas. <sep><sep> On the contrary, on the other hand, during this economic crisis that was sweeping the country, we found that the MMM was going astray from its original goals. <sep><sep> It should have stayed focused on its initial principles on the sidelines to regain breathing space, but with its practical involvement, its standards were improving. <sep><sep> It's not just a matter of bringing us forward on the surface, but when faced with this demand, it's pushing us back. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy talked about the launching of the new elections and mentioned that for the first time in Mauritius there was a partial after a seat was vacated due to electoral fraud. <sep><sep> Ram: When the decision was made in 1983, this was inserted into a process where we would go towards elimination through an electoral reform. <sep><sep> It's a form of maturity where people are finding themselves in this electoral exercise despite it being a limited form of democracy like a resistance form against the State of Israel and its occupation forces. <sep><sep> Krishna Thirapathi, who represents www.kiltir.com, brought an online laptop and presented the website on a mirror in the LPT, and showed how it is used. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin explained how historical bourgeoisie puts pressure on workers to become seasonal, and for real wages to decrease. <sep><sep> And this makes Paloma an individualist who treats her extended family seasonally as if they're worthless, and as targets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Especially in the Republic, they are all going to show the other adults that reading and writing should not be difficult to read or learn. <sep><sep> Where the ocean meets the sand, with coconut trees and goats frolicking in the water, the geometric shapes create a sensation on the front of Piterbot without breaking a sweat; even my breath was taken away. <sep><sep> The Carter administration's counter-offensive was based on 30 years of "depoliticization", "civil society", "doing nothing without funding, NGOs, only "the social". <sep><sep> It is interesting that “exemplarity” is also a concept that has been developed, and that it is also involved in today's reality when exemplarity begins to falter. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, different Governments have initiated and encouraged a series of measures to face this gradual reduction in the real price of sugar exports, but all these measures were aimed at maintaining the profitability of the Sugar Companies. <sep><sep> It is simply huge, 4 times larger and 4 times smaller than it. <sep><sep> Just as a lead weight was preventing them from sinking into the difficult waters, it is pushing them deep into the background.<sep><sep> A: Mauritius has a suitable climate for 3 harvests per year. <sep><sep> Can we accept that Diego Garcia, a torture chamber, can be used as Gordon Brown's former British Prime Minister admitted in the British Parliament? <sep><sep> But in the European Court of Human Rights, where Chagossians also have a say, they will have rights to return to Chagos as British subjects, to return to BIOT as British territory, a colony. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Following this allegation, Cehl Meeah has been arrested on serious charges. <sep><sep> Otherwise, if we did not have a theoretical concept such as "Historical Block" (which is experiencing a systemic crisis that is leading to its collapse), if we did not have this kind of analytical tool, we would be forced to talk about a deathly atmosphere in our conversation. <sep><sep> Property and various shaded and mysterious characters in the State (on one hand you have the CEO here, a boss there, a trusted politician, a private guard). <sep><sep> He had a big plan for his son who needed to become a terrible person in the world of royalty. <sep><sep> And it was necessary for all workers, I am speaking to all employees, to bring about a struggle against exploitation. <sep><sep> There is also a serene dictatorship when he makes his getaway. <sep><sep> And in other countries as well, it is not easy, but there are very interesting things. <sep><sep> This is largely due to its role in providing nutrients (for people, for cattle, for poultry, and other animals) for energy. <sep><sep> Neither the Government nor the opposition have the political will to propose an economic development that takes into account the serious crises the world is going through such as food crises, energy crises, ecological crises, and social crises. <sep><sep> Does this not mean that there will still be competition? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He then said that at that moment he felt dizzy, he fainted without any knowledge. <sep><sep> Netanyahu, also, has based his speech on the necessity of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders for peace to be achieved. <sep><sep> Rashid Bhundhoo had read his poem "Time", which reflects the feelings of people who are always complaining that they "do not have time". <sep><sep> A transitional program that brings together all the struggles that people are currently leading, the struggles that people are ready to lead, it puts all of that together. <sep><sep> The government is absorbing part of the added value from this work (which we have explained workers produce with their bravery) to pay a certain number of workers a salary for the work they do all year round. <sep><sep> Fatma had a special affection for Siram and Ayoun who had decided to live their sexuality differently, naturally, without any complexes. <sep><sep> Today we have to find a way through which we can force Israel to act as a civilized state, obliging it to respect Palestinians, all its neighboring countries, and be accountable to its people and the world? <sep><sep> Jean Claude de L'Estrac, Director of L'Express, says that he does not impose any restrictions on what his reporters write, as they are independent. <sep><sep> It is also seen in the press through articles by André Masson, NMU, and G.Duval, who have been promoting the French language. <sep><sep> He himself does not have anything to do with trade union struggles. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the meantime, there is a "cash flow" problem that the IRS was supposed to reduce, because many cities have been hit hard due to the crisis in Lerop. Ethanol is not doing well either, as far as I know. <sep> <sep> He will tell you to go, he's not going to agree. <sep> <sep> And he says he understands that there is an electoral reform on today's political agenda. <sep> <sep> Jean-Claude de Caprinin was a very special person; he didn't have a second. <sep> <sep> Many things that were unclear were becoming clearer. <sep> <sep> This would give him some space and time to breathe. <sep> <sep> The impression one gets is a love that transcends differences, but in the end, the film is filling all kinds of cracks and precipices that have been invented from all sides to the point where love crystallizes and no longer acts as the connecting force of their differences. <sep> <sep> A drastic political development in the current economic system, the capitalist system, has not managed to reduce social inequalities or reduce the impacts on the environment. <sep> <sep> LALIT stands in solidarity with licensed Infinity workers who are demonstrating and organizing in front of Infinity Tower. <sep> <sep> At the beginning of the campaign, when we entered the campaign, we said that it is not exactly our main goal to get as many votes as possible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Don't forget that there was a program on TV about inaugurating a new food production project. <sep><sep> In La Reunion, LALIT had regular exchanges with Maron organization before becoming the New Anti-Capitalist Party (Réunion). <sep><sep> It was said that in issue number 8, there might be a result of the economic policies of Sithanen/Ramgoolam that take care of the country's economy. <sep><sep> And then, if you "win", it won't bring you any peace. <sep><sep> In the para-state sector, in municipalities and other para-state sectors, unemployment is quite high, over 50%. <sep><sep> Such a crisis could have extremely dangerous social repercussions, other than obvious economic repercussions: <sep><sep> It could lead to our extinction, and perhaps the extinction of all living creatures, all species. <sep><sep> This means stopping VRS, transferring workers to a diversified sector under the same conditions as before. <sep><sep> The government has no plan to create jobs on a large scale. <sep><sep> With a deliberate policy of separation, Israel's Patron is starting to establish industrial zones in the West Bank and Gaza. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to the economists, there is no sign of a light at the end of the tunnel. <sep><sep> GWF, FPU and FTU had formed a special Trade Union, under the NTUC umbrella. <sep><sep> They can no longer just look the other way, pass by, and go to work. <sep><sep> Just like a lady who was married on the MPL with a "ti-mons" name, a man who was in prison, had to go to the Supreme Court to find out how he could get a divorce. <sep><sep> From Tel Aviv towards Ariel but not to Hares village. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is still unrest in Bahrain, Yemen, and the Saudi Arabia. <sep><sep> What happened was an epidemic RIOT gave the order for a 30-year-old RIOT to begin a face-to-face confrontation with all protesting families. <sep><sep> But the Government, no matter which bourgeois government, when it has to make a decision, undergoes various pressure. <sep><sep> However, in many other countries, unions have more weight in negotiations. <sep><sep> We also analyzed the inconsistencies and fragmentation of the trade union movement preventing it from acting on a unified front in the face of an economic crisis and dangerous privatization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Why are you angry? - Angry? - Didn't you hear me calling you a degaze? I call ... <sep><sep> They have no respect for anyone in the world for what they have done. <sep><sep> We have a comrade who has pledged to fight against police brutality and organize JUSTICE. <sep><sep> I am amazed that no one has spoken out about it because of its severity. <sep><sep> Now, when Bérenger is absent from the political scene for 3 months due to illness, the historical bourgeoisie finds that he is supporting the Jugnauths and an MMM without its leader. <sep><sep> this means this network of institutions that maintain a reign of a social class over other classes, that they, these other classes, must remain subordinate. <sep><sep> The idea of alternatives is present and dynamic. <sep><sep> Comrade Bryan: Later you were talking about class struggle, or you mentioned people like Marx who participated in defining class struggle. <sep><sep> We find that LALIT plays an important role, as a political party challenging bourgeois rule, to ensure that it is not just a revolt, but rather a movement that has the political capacity to bring about the transformation of the power relations we aim for. <sep><sep> We want to ensure that each voter uses his three votes in a reflective and constructive manner, without falling into the trap of alliances that are openly serving their own interests and ambitions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But their levels in English itself (which is far from their second language) was higher in the second group and their tendency towards progress was continuing. <sep><sep> Employers and bosses, increasing prices, proposals for eliminating language compensation and sanctions for labor law violations to facilitate employer licensing. <sep><sep> Note the way they are doing propaganda on this "2 million tourists" issue. <sep><sep> without almost mentioning the Employment Relations Bill that will replace the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) against which the trade union movement and LALIT have campaigned for 30 years; <sep><sep> Whether it's in our literacy courses, our teacher training sessions or the fight for the recognition of ancestral languages in Mauritius. <sep><sep> The central point in this Plan is a very specific provision to maintain as much as possible as it is now, meaning now it is at 575,000 tons, and in 10 years they are reducing it to 550,000 tons, more or less the same. <sep><sep> One positive point, the union didn't have to negotiate to reduce overtime. <sep><sep> Or in the police force, in other words, there is a specific quota system. <sep><sep> Every election that we point out, we see it, case by case (because it's a tactical question, not a strategic question for us - so we say we are not electoralist; election is one of our political actions): <sep><sep> When we say "languages", we are talking about "human languages", not a specific language among the thousands of different languages that exist on the planet. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have seen the extraordinary potential in mobilizing the masses, known as "Arab Spring", but we have also analyzed its limitations, weaknesses and even political dangers. <sep>

<sep> In a report that appeared in "Le Mauricien" on Tuesday 19th, it seems that other stakeholders highlighted positions that the MMM and MSM have on the Employment Relations Bill to replace the IRA. <sep>

<sep> Our relationship with the trade union movement and trade unions is always a "working conflicting arrangement". It is a "working arrangement" in the sense that the trade union movement represents the only well-developed organization in the working class of Mauritius today. <sep>

<sep> Therefore, there has been talk for some time about the creation of a 5th International. <sep>

<sep> It is a long title for a Congress, but we have chosen a title that explains the content of the Congress. <sep>

<sep> In this legal framework, this labor law passed by a Government depends on 2 factors: <sep>

<sep> It provides a lot of detail for 5 different "schemes". <sep>

<sep> Then, when the Bill comes into parliament, the National Women's Council, which includes these 1,100 women's organizations called Women's Associations in each region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Noam Chomsky, Professor at MIT, plays a central role in criticizing the institutions that have capitalist systems in place today (http://www.zmag.org/chomsky). <sep><sep> He insists on a constant understanding of the deep interconnection between the realms of zoology (whose order is not eternal but constantly evolving, created at a particular moment in geological history and continuing to evolve and change over time). <sep><sep> Our program focuses on providing access to beautiful natural spaces for everyone, in order to avoid alienation between people and their environment. <sep><sep> What does a blanket of leaves over the PT program signify: to expand the social base of the bourgeoisie (through creating a larger bourgeoisie through state intervention, which is now considered as a "favor", meaning "favoritism", "corruption"). <sep><sep> Forces and women are roasting and cooking in large pots over huge fires and outside among the trees. <sep><sep> As there are no alternative plans, conditions should be established for the constant reorganization of its caravel, in order to have more plantations of vegetables inside. <sep><sep> Soldiers have said that they are aware of the 3rd-world law. <sep><sep> C. talk in Arabic, then he talks to the family. <sep><sep> What we observe today is that there are many threats within the family, especially since the capitalist economy: <sep><sep> So, these discoveries cause a crisis in society because they challenge relations, they challenge the state. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Due to global and national economic crises this year, it is CAPITALIST CRISIS, SOCIALIST SOLUTION. <sep><sep> It is idealistic to believe that there could be a system that eliminates competition altogether. <sep><sep> When crises occur in the country, people realize that sometimes they need to regroup with other resources. <sep><sep> Our campaign began with the first document we published on energy production, it was called the Agricultural, Agro-Industrial, and Electricity Production Campaign, back in 2003. <sep><sep> It involved a whole system of training, book production, organizing exams in Creole, conducting research, and of course, promoting communication between teachers and parents on the value of the mother tongue as a medium. <sep><sep> In the Zini State, where the class consciousness is advanced, they have succeeded during the Occupy Wall Street movement. <sep><sep> This success means that their colleagues have great respect for them. <sep><sep> Men were climbing onto tractors to bring their lily, their banners, as we say, and their matlas. <sep><sep> This Socialist Alliance Government is coming up with proposals to replace the IRA with another law that i consider very dangerous. <sep><sep> Many workers from other regions have joined our movement now. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And at the Alger Forum, it is a forum that will help us to shed light on the imperialist attitude, the hypocrisy of the British government because we know that since the present government, the situation remains the same. <sep><sep> What is common in these three cases is their economic policies. <sep><sep> And everyone has the right to his privacy, whether it is the State or any private company - whether it is the company that is behind the credit card, or the bank that will serve it. <sep><sep> Thierry Chateaux went to work in the Hotel industry quietly, after denouncing them before in "These Scary Hotels". <sep><sep> All eyes were kept on what these three men were going to say, while everyone, even those who were supposed to be more informed, continued to confuse the issue. <sep><sep> It is a serious reflection on the nature of these organizers. <sep><sep> In January 2010, this boat was used to monitor the Middle East, support Israel and threaten Iran. <sep><sep> - He had a union with the Plantation Workers’ Union and the Artisans & General Workers’ Union (traditionally PT). <sep><sep> Three Sadous, Karann, Karinn, and Karonn continued their paths. <sep><sep> True freedom culture will come out into the open as the Planet-of- Senz goes to conquer Gondwana. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we hear talk of gender equality while ignoring the strategy, we need to pay attention, as it is a powerful strategy. <sep> It can be done within the framework of 'national unity' for a very simple reason - mainly because it is always popular. <sep> Once again, like the MMMSP, they received a lot of coverage in the press for their program and even debates in Le Mauricien and Week-End. <sep> The capitalist globalization is destroying all companies that are not very strong. <sep> The USA recently gave back the 1960s that it had with the UK on the Seychelles islands of Aldabra, Desroches, and Farquhar, which all formed part of the B.I.O.T63 <sep> In LALIT, we must fight for a program based on an ideology that prioritizes the interests of the working class, to be in a supporting position for a political party that is neither in favor of the bourgeoisie section called the state bourgeoisie (established capitalist). <sep> Since then, people identify us as militants, as a political group, which takes a class struggle stance. <sep> The opposition, neither MMM nor MSM, has no real alternative to criticize the government. <sep> By 2011, Ashok Subron was able to break through, in the heart of this historical block, to save Minister of Labor Shakeel Mohamed, accusing the leaders of the security industry of being "in the hands of the Minister of Labor". <sep> Institutionalized communalism, on the other hand, has become a major problem; it is definitely not just about the Best Loser. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In fact, what we are achieving in JUSTICE is that we are not getting these systematic methods (DNA, searching rods, robot portraits, fingerprints, etc) in serious situations. <sep><sep> If the MSM-MMM government has completely ignored this crime, it is a warning that the entire reform process is a mere formality. <sep><sep> however, the articulation that we are doing is to suggest solutions that question the system. <sep><sep> So much so that it has become a flaw where a new Group on Facebook has started a campaign called "Stop just Adding us to Bloody Groups!" <sep><sep> There is a Settlement managed by top lawyers. <sep><sep> Remember, Mauritius is a highly organized country, a great advantage for workers. <sep><sep> A banana, a trade unionist has put all their energy into reintegrating into an MBC position. <sep><sep> So, British capitalists are destroying the earth in Lem and Lesip where cotton is grown, and people in the city of Lerop are feeling the heat, and when it rains, it becomes part of the floods, in distress. <sep><sep> And then in these last few years, we have witnessed a phenomenon where there has been a general practice of violence, we have seen systematic violence, and more than anything, even glorified violence by the MCIT team itself on Prem Raddhoa. <sep><sep> Immediately the Government should announce that it is organizing for the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the opposition leader to visit Chagos and Diego on the Trochetia boat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Although this sector has expanded significantly, the unions in the sector have not made much progress. <sep><sep> Especially in the context of media freedom that is threatened today through measures taken by the Government against private radio stations. <sep><sep> The question raised today is, why Cehl Meeah is not exposing the regime as we are doing it? <sep><sep> When the economic crisis hits hard, one is forced to publicize the case, a plantation that was to bring in Rs120,000 earns Rs500,000 - 600,000. <sep><sep> When Berenger seeks to take a position on these class struggles, he tends to defend establishment owners because he agrees with liberal capitalism. <sep><sep> One key result of this conference was the recognition of the authority that led to the signing of the Grand River Declaration, which emanated from the conference and was agreed upon by Minister Boolell. <sep><sep> The Select Committee Report contains 2 completely different propositions. <sep><sep> Even though capitalism is accustomed to cyclical crises, crises that "naturally" return, crises that bring back competitiveness, the crisis in Mauritius today is a systemic crisis. <sep><sep> Here, without consensus, things must change. <sep><sep> Whether it is MMM, MSM, or National Union, they defend this ultra-liberal policy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Under the IRA law, a worker can be imprisoned for a month just because he participated in a strike. <sep>

Then, Bizlall started a collective hunger strike. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, there is the sedentary section of capital sitting aloof - consisting of establishment and big planters. <sep><sep> But when a boss tells me to take an office job to organize various tasks, I usually decline because I know that then I'll have to wear Tantinn Ganga. <sep><sep> Today, all members and sympathizers of Lalit have been invited to reflect on the theme: "Workers today: What Program? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a historical book, in terms of: its quality is so good, not only its content but also its impression and its attention to detail as a transparent blend of green and yellow colors between Preface and poem. <sep><sep> He learned during a full-time week in Goa. <sep><sep> Similarly, when clowns, cutting through Maurice which is very small, will not be able to plant "Energy Cane" cloned on Flat Island. <sep><sep> On Saturday, the 20th of October, there was Group A4 and Menwar. <sep><sep> But according to him, there is something called "Marxist ideology". <sep><sep> There is also the ABAIM work that drew much cassette tape and book in Creole. <sep><sep> It is a program that he developed for fun debates, discussions, meetings, better understanding, providing new information in context. <sep><sep> And Marx was very attentive to the development of this kind of willingness among workers. <sep><sep> In 2005, Lalit started a national campaign for an alternative economy, and we had predicted a crisis in the sugar industry already. <sep><sep> This barbaric and repressive police action against street vendors and other sweet vendors who could live on this commerce, was condemned and it was not a final solution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Through tradition, it is customary for regulations to be bypassed. <sep><sep> And many of the things we have proposed have indeed materialized. <sep><sep> The local production of rum is done on a commercial basis where there are huge profits for these private producers. <sep><sep> In political education every now and then, we have members of our regional present. <sep><sep> Monday 23 July 2007, the boss of Floreal Knitwear broke the strike of 218 Bangladeshi workers by invoking the "illegal strike" pretext. <sep><sep> The file contains demands for emergency plans that Lalit is proposing to face the economic crisis. <sep><sep> We were in a demonstration, together with CTSP, against these two laws, until they were voted in Parliament. <sep><sep> It is true that a country like Maldives in 50 years to 100 years, will completely disappear. <sep><sep> There were plans to put in place a more centralized and less democratic regional administration, where all Village Councils in Mauritius would be abolished and replaced by 7 Mini-Municipalities. <sep><sep> At the same time, the last 7-year tranquility has been disturbed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then there are Awards, which come from the National Remuneration Board (NRB). <sep><sep> In the last 50 years, there have been 2 significant contributions to the role of the press in modern society. <sep><sep> More people are ending up in prison. This leads to another series of problems arising. <sep><sep> It will be on Saturday, 23rd November at 10.00 am at Orl Mama Bul Later, GRNW. <sep><sep> On the international stage, we need to work with other governments to launch a new trading institution to replace the WTO, which is corrupted by capitalist multinational corporations and imperialist interests. <sep><sep> Sometimes there are opportunities right in front of us, and we need to, when we are preparing, reflect on the possibilities of those opportunities. <sep><sep> Sell the house on Sale by Levy, it is worth a fortune. <sep><sep> Because whether you are far or close to where you are supposed to stay, either the police or free man (who were left by workers who had left their place where they were supposed to stay like a spare) can be. <sep><sep> And this is a contribution that LALIT is continuing to make in our daily militant work while our other political actions. <sep><sep> Soldiers when they march or when they talk to people, their physical toughness always points at. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If an employer wants to lay off a person, under what conditions can they do so? <sep><sep> The fact that the majority of intellectuals in this country have continued to keep their heads firmly stuck under the sand has not prevented the crisis from worsening. <sep><sep> They have made a public appeal to the Prime Minister now on sovereignty. <sep><sep> There are those who have sugar cane, those who have sickness and sugar cane, those who produce electricity, those who don't produce electricity, etc., so their interests sometimes conflict. <sep><sep> The Creole language, as well as Bhojpuri, have been profoundly insulted, scorned, devalued, and harshly repressed by the State during the colonial period and even after independence by different regimes of Ramgoolam, Jugnauth, and Berenger. <sep><sep> It has been emphasized that fundamentalist religious organizations do not have the capacity to bring about any real anti-imperialist struggle at all because they themselves have benefited from the support and backing of the Chinese State for many years. <sep><sep> Neither the working class nor the educated have benefited from the SC or HSC. <sep><sep> There were strong points made during the shipwreck crisis of the Nordvaer, and sit-ins when people refused to disembark from the ship. <sep><sep> Members of LALIT, Kisna goes to Palestine, 2007 (for the second time). <sep><sep> It is from the American military base in Diego Garcia in Chagos that the Americans launched their attacks against civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Grandparents, understand that there is diversity in views, so that the more progressive, the more voices can express our opinions in a democratic way. <sep><sep> The press article and radio program they use to maintain contact with the masses. <sep><sep> * Holding meetings - small and public; meeting with existing associations (non-criminal). <sep><sep> Good agricultural land in Mauritius, it is under the control of private sectors. <sep><sep> Among a series of people, some of them who were against the Creole language, have evolved, changed, and started to work towards introducing their mother tongue. <sep><sep> If we look at our internationalism in the workplace, there are different stages in the LALIT's practice of internationalism: <sep><sep> Whether it's in Reduit or Bobasin, these speeches are mainly about who is responsible for breaking, who is selling the blood of the workers in Mauritius. <sep><sep> But as a true punishment, it was a legacy. <sep><sep> He said to us, "Because no other family should die due to illegal labor." <sep><sep> That is, a year, since Mauritius's economy has been so closely linked to Europe, between tourism, textiles, dyeing, a crisis in the Eurozone has inevitably created problems in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was caught by the blade of his hunger, deep in his clear-as-water eyes, a small sweat on his forehead. <sep> In a transitional program, we do not look at problems as individual issues but rather as a total resolution, then after we can analyze all these problems and solutions together, right. <sep> This represents a form of repression against Lalit militants. <sep> and it has also been presented as something that follows the logic of the Illovo Deal and the Sugar Industry Efficiency Act amendment. <sep> We can also discuss how "Mauritianism" has become a political ideology and also a political strategy. <sep> Amidst Lalit's fight against wrong policies, Timi's focus was on all those who were being shot at by the lake, things were changing. <sep> Now here in Grand River, we are aware of what is happening, we are aware of the serious crisis. <sep> Likewise, the country is divided into 2 categories: those who can afford to pay the Income Tax and benefit from a subsidy on university fees, and the rest of the people. <sep> I don't know if they are checking something specific or if they are causing trouble. <sep> So the lady had already visited a series of villages, and on the walls of the small town that still bore the marks, signs of the Authority had been painted to indicate where the water would come in next year, with Fate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The owner of a large percentage of the best agricultural land, and a lot of agricultural land are being converted into buildings or IRS and its golf course;

NATO is leaving Afghanistan, and as in Iraq, a catastrophic situation is being left behind. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means the need for all kinds of other means to have this basic requirement, based on agriculture and livestock. <sep><sep> There is currently a conflict between Governor of the Central Bank, Manou Bheenick, and Finance Minister Xavier Duval regarding the arbitrary exchange rate between the rupee and foreign currency. <sep><sep> The reason for this is multiple (the working class was relatively strong where there was a revolution, even if the percentage of the population is relatively low in terms of agricultural income. <sep><sep> * Even if there are times, the State will temporarily resolve conflicts between different classes, ultimately, it imposes its "lord", a "lord" who is the ruling class, it establishes. <sep><sep> You can choose which team you will provide service: an interpretation team to translate what visitors say and what Mauritians say (for visitors), a team handling audio-recording-DVD players, a team welcoming visitors from outside. <sep><sep> As for the obligation imposed on candidates to form a community on the Nomination Paper for all candidates in the election, in the 1983, 1987, 2000 elections. <sep><sep> Following a question from the Socialist reporter, who asked about support for a traditional political party in favor of the Palestinians, it is not for electoral reasons. <sep><sep> These 3 elements are what will determine the working conditions. <sep><sep> - To organize a formal visit to the Trochetia boat by a delegation including the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, to Chagos (including Diego Garcia) this part of the "Mauritius" territory defined as such in the country's Constitution. <sep><sep> A family owned company will not solve the problem of unemployment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the SIDS campaign, we do not find any hint of political and economic questions that have brought the economic fragility that the small island states suffer. <sep> <sep> Prof. Juggessur took a stand against subsidies on electricity. <sep> <sep> Before that, Minister of Foreign Affairs Arvind Boolell announced that the Republic of Mauritius is "actively" working towards recognizing Palestine as a state. <sep> <sep> "To enter Palestine, you do not have to go through Israel's immigration," he said." <sep> <sep> He also spoke about how Diego Garcia's sovereignty has come into question as people are being held there in a Guantanamo-style detention. <sep> <sep> With the flu on the rise, Berenger continues to boycott parliament from the inside while threatening resignation. <sep> <sep> His family, friends, and supporters embrace him, poets write poems that praise him, the leader of the Communist Party in the world almost entirely opts to criticize him. <sep> <sep> When he was young, his first contacts with politicians were negative. <sep> <sep> If you want to know how they navigate the river, you should look at the film! <sep> <sep> Today, the boss, when his system is in trouble, wants to change the Constitution of Mauritius, for example. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, country here, according to the employer's vision, is supposed to have luxury tourism hotels, IRS, resorts offering entertainment for foreigners, private marinas, exclusive parties, on the coast and also a good inland destination. <sep><sep> Remember that JUSTICE has become a 30-year-old organization that has signed our counter-report to the United Nations. <sep><sep> It has stabilized it to make people like ourselves and other people, have a place to put us if we do not find ourselves neither here nor there, in these communities. <sep><sep> There is the matter of the Israel plan to reroute Miray - a plan to surround the village of Marda, which lies between two settlements, in two mirays. <sep><sep> So when you are a person in LALIT you need to have 2 seemingly contradictory qualities, on one hand courage, determination and solidarity and on the other hand patience, empathy and willingness to understand others. <sep><sep> The LALIT 2013 February seminar was an internal LALIT militant seminar to analyze the current situation in depth, and to discuss our strategies, orientations, actions and methods. <sep><sep> It is a government that comes from the workers' movement, its name is the "Labour Party". <sep><sep> We need to remember that we are dealing with desperate men. <sep><sep> Cehl Meeah, who had positioned himself for a nomination in the PT-PMSD Government after 2010, had to defend himself against allegations of embezzlement of mining money that had been charged against him. <sep><sep> Why have the Chagos illegally detached from Mauritius in 1965 before independence? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, Tariq Ramadan has admitted that there are "institutional" issues behind certain problems that seem communal. <sep><sep> There is a file in the latest Mauritius Times by historian S. <sep><sep> They are acting in such a way that their approach is logical to create a 5th community (like Ziz Balancy was trying to do in his time) and then to stabilize best losers. <sep><sep> In South Africa, they are happy to use images and symbols in construction to illustrate the importance of using the mother tongue. <sep><sep> Therefore, according to Lalit, Ashok Subron has said, the MSM-MMM electoral arrangement is very dangerous for the future. <sep><sep> They went to listen to the old folks who reminded them of the landmarks where they used to serve water before the government installed public taps everywhere. <sep><sep> Last year I was in Port Louis market and I was surprised to see that they were selling oranges from Jaffa there. <sep><sep> On Wednesday, the 19th of January, another member of Lalit, Lindsey Collen has had a separate quarrel with Ram Seegobin, which had been brewing since the 19th of December 2002. <sep><sep> Kate was cooking potatoes and cheese in the oven and for dessert, she made a flan and a salad. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the Revi (reunion) was founded, we dedicated a part of it to the "Rezo" network in our region: Reunion, South Africa, Comoros, Madagascar. <sep><sep> For example, another place to say that the Prime Minister can declare "state money". <sep><sep> meaning there are easy facilities for planting that produce food, whether it is in Mauritius or Rodrigues; <sep><sep> it is a form of privatization in licenses that you say people for education will have to go to a private institution because the government is no longer providing it. <sep><sep> Diego does not realize that for those living in the countryside, like the Sanchez family, there are not many snakes or no finished snakes but rather many lizards. <sep><sep> In many villages, there are demonstrations against the migration and colonization and the majority of Palestinians have no illusions about the resumption of negotiations. <sep><sep> One morning we will wake up, we will open the Constitution, it will not be included. <sep><sep> At the same time, the MMM-MSM re-make has not really made a big impact. <sep><sep> At the same time, the period where I am in a sector where class consciousness is at its lowest. <sep><sep> in the union sector, only the unions themselves, it is not possible for us to have all the answers to guide a deeper analysis on which we can draw a direction for our members. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Education for Workers Federation has just issued a Press Statement which says: <sep><sep> They have just approved 2 ERa and ERi laws that are supposed to weaken the Worker and Union Classes in relation to employers. <sep><sep> We had a very difficult debate with him. <sep><sep> It will become very easy for Ramgoolam to blame all of this on Xavier Duval, forcing him to quit the Government. <sep><sep> On the other hand, it is a good note that the director of PMSD has nothing to say against this cascade of price increases we have been experiencing. <sep><sep> Hopefully, a lot of memories will be able to record when needed, a phone card, a role for each of our teeth at 7. <sep><sep> There was a Sugar Levy, a duty imposed on the dice, a tax that is heavier on industry than on plantations. <sep><sep> Like all the civil servants who are about to retire, he was already negotiating for a vice-presidency, a small contract in a ministry and why not, a ticket for the next election. <sep><sep> At the election level, when we vote for a party, we are actually voting for a single head of a very bifurcated man (2 almost identical alliances) which in fact is a unique system of a capitalistic liberal party. <sep><sep> World Creole Day allocation, four organizations (ABAIM, Federation Playgroup, Education for Workers, Foundation for Children Earth of Peace). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the fact that a certain number of parties that are participating in the general elections, they are shamelessly campaigning in a communalist or fundamentalist manner, this press has made them aware of their real intentions. <sep><sep> Yesterday in every democratic country, it's impossible to impose an ID Card on everyone. <sep><sep> Clearly it is no longer in his interest to negotiate for everyone. <sep><sep> When he started having contractions, Sami called Dharam Raj who was eagerly waiting to take them to the clinic. <sep><sep> It's time for us, together, to take a stand and start questioning the current system that is dominating us, because our future is at stake! <sep><sep> 'As I was passing by I thought to come take your news.' - 'Ram! What a nice surprise! Come in, sit down. <sep><sep> At the same time we say that the trade union struggle doesn't automatically create conditions for the advance of socialism, at the same time we say that in their flames, the trade union struggle represents the vanguard of the working class which is essential in the struggle for socialism. <sep><sep> This means that a capitalist economy different states have come together to form a Europe, as they have found a way to avoid the kind of crisis that often occurs in capitalism. <sep><sep> A second point that he makes, which is also interesting, is that when he explained how social constraints due to tradition, such as marriage institutions, provide sanctions for a woman who diminishes her value. <sep><sep> So when assessing the Party, it is worth looking into our strict functioning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the 2 terms, he redecorated his house room by room in the same place. <sep> <sep> Therefore, anywhere in the world, officials conducting investigations, they conduct inquiries and then make arrests. <sep> <sep> And in normal times when a leader is attacked by politicians such as Jean Claude de L'Estrac, Aneerood Jugnauth. <sep> <sep> So after the resignation of the MSM in the Government, we had these meetings. <sep> <sep> Especially when there is a state that discriminates, and all kinds of community organizations are growing such as Hindu House, Voice of Hindu, etc. <sep> <sep> Reflect on whether it serves to support a political party that represents the interests or the "enemy of the proletariat". <sep> <sep> It is these economic and strategic factors that are causing this instability. <sep> <sep> We find it unproductive for the development of our party, to participate in this campaign. Ram Seegobin has said that we would rather build an opposition force outside parliament, based on a program. <sep> <sep> LALIT is inviting the public to a forum debate at Site Richelieu, Monday April 10th at 6:00 pm at the Village Hall. <sep> <sep> For ME, that means giving the first 4-8 or 5-10-year-old children in each primary school the books that came first in the CPE in their primary schools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here, we had a meeting with Minister Zaffar Etranzer. <sep><sep> According to the Israeli association B'Tselem, between February 27 and March 3, the Israeli army killed 106 Palestinians in Gaza, including 54 civilians, among them 25 children and teenagers under 18. <sep><sep> In a year where land ownership issues have been a major concern, Lalit has launched its "Agriculture and Agro-Industry" program, focusing on land ownership issues. <sep><sep> For us, what is important is Mauritian Creole and Bhojpuri Mauritian, the mother tongues of children, and their oppressed language. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, there are threats in Mauritius to remove subsidies on basic food items. <sep><sep> Back in 1860, there was an advancement of the term "ecology" in the same sense as we use it today by a German biologist, and the term was used by Marx in the same modern sense. <sep><sep> This was done in Orl LPT, Grand River North West, starting at 2:00 pm. <sep><sep> Together, these 5 organizations wrote a letter to Herve Aime requesting what steps need to be taken regarding the Chagos issue. <sep><sep> Vote on a budget to promote the export of agricultural and agro-industrial products, similar to what the MTPA (Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority) has, where tourism is concerned. <sep><sep> Also, there is another important question that has come up regarding how Lerop funds are being used, and how it aligns with our campaign. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is worth the pain to keep them separated in our heads, when we think, to understand their articulation. <sep><sep> However, Navin Ramgoolam has a different nature. <sep><sep> He proposes electoral reforms that will amplify communal virus in the electoral system. <sep><sep> Up to today, we have the book by John Bellamy Foster which shows that the foundations of Marxism, its subject themselves, are firmly rooted in ecology, based on what Marx called the "metabolic rift". <sep><sep> There is a series of luxury products produced by workers, which the same workers will never be able to afford. <sep><sep> Almost 100 years later, we are facing a great global crisis, and now, almost 100 years later, according to mainstream bourgeois economists, what is happening in the newspapers like "The Economist", like "Financial Times" is all being forecasted. <sep><sep> The final evening was designed as Ashok and Pravind Jugnauth. <sep><sep> And Ramgoolam fired shots to announce that his Government had opted for a political decision to make the sugar industry become a cannabis industry, and profitable, through all kinds of IRS, etc. <sep><sep> When Roland Fozoo told the Magistrate that he had work problems, and when he needed to come to Court at any time, the Magistrate presented an excuse. <sep><sep> His newspapers continue their assault on Ramgoolam because they and their employers in general prefer Berenger, argue against him, and they would be very happy if he joined the Government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this is what will make the difference between whether this crisis, it will bring a barbaric space, where there will be bloodshed, terrible camps, and a start of a new system, a new system. <sep><sep> In the Sugar Industry, with VRS and Centralization, more than 10,000 workers have been laid off. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin will invite Jimmy Jean Louis to his program on Radio Plus on the current affairs hour, Sunday 13th February. <sep><sep> Instead of the deep interest of all women, children, the majority of men, all the creators on our planet, and all the plants on our land. <sep><sep> There was a very informative British television series called "Yes Minister" that showed how even when a Minister wanted to do something slightly progressivist, it wasn't so well aligned with the bourgeois State. <sep><sep> And it is an analysis that has been developed and reactivated by all members of LALIT. <sep><sep> The army is saying that the presence of Israeli and International volunteers is provoking the colonies. <sep><sep> Certainly the police noticed that something funny is happening. <sep><sep> Today one of the 2 principal coordinators, Noor Adam Essack, has, too, been subject to this Resistance rice. <sep><sep> He needed to give a lesson to make both ends meet, but at the same time he didn't give the lesson, he preferred to go to the godown or to his mom who did everything to attack his son in agreement with his zipper. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A meeting between the leaders of the parties Biddya and Hares was held today. <sep> In the canal there were sharks, alligators, crocodiles, anacondas, boas, rays, lizards, piranhas and other carnivorous fish. <sep> We are also announcing to the Government that we are no longer bending the rules as we used to. <sep> The National Economic Development Council (KNDE) report on development plans was very well received by a small group, and the demonstrations organized by MNL attracted large crowds. <sep> Therefore, Ram Seegobin will not be on Radio One Sunday as previously announced. <sep> Everyone knows that there is corruption when there is discretionary payment. <sep> Wednesday evening, the MBC Tele-Objective program, as a real government watchdog, organized a debate where 4 people were in favor of the Local Government Bill. <sep> This program took place on Wednesday, November 9, 2005 in the Barenchowbay hall at the University of Mauritius. <sep> It also helps us understand why some progress can be difficult to accomplish - particularly in the field of law enforcement. <sep> S. and M. went to pick olives together with a farmer near the village of Hares, where we live. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The establishment was strong, it had managed to make the Government after Government pay it to rest in the cane field, when there should have been beautiful experimental modern agricultural forms. <sep> There was a crisis in a series of organizations that had links with the State. <sep> There are only improvements in the fund for employers due to devaluation, a devaluation that worsens the situation. <sep> If they don't leave, they stay there, they will have a problem. <sep> In the secret ballot, all employees vote not just members of the union. <sep> Furthermore, many environmentalists expose themselves, with their complicity with private companies and imperialist governments, as complicit against the environment. <sep> This means that GN 230 says: Each association must keep its minutes, documents, reports in English, Creole, French or Bhojpuri; <sep> Music, painting, writing and poetry artists, all support Lalit. <sep> Second, where universal human rights defense falls within the "welfare state", Navin Ramgoolam in his speech of proclamation promised that pensions will be a right "without any form of replacement". <sep>In 1983, for the 1983 elections, we analyzed that, when MMM took power in 1982 with PSM, MMM applied a very liberal, ultra-liberal policy that in fact favored the historical bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But there was a part, especially a majority, which was not a member of Lalit. <sep><sep> We also find in this educational system, which lacks coordination between the different sectors involved. <sep><sep> Classes, be they in, or not in English, in the capitalist era (which became predominant for the first time from 1790 onwards), have 2 main social classes that have emerged. <sep><sep> The situation is becoming so serious that many commentators are asking if the European Union can survive as an economic entity. <sep><sep> So, as Lenin and Trotsky were leaders who were created by a strong and mobilized working class, 7 years after that Revolution, Stalin was a leader who was created by a weak, fragmented, and exhausted working class. <sep><sep> A possible witness, Toorab Bissessur, has never come out with witness testimony. <sep><sep> Where electoral reform, which is also a pretext for a coalition, is hitting against the best loser system. <sep><sep> And it has also been emphasized that education is an inherent right and that all children should have the right to a good school. <sep><sep> Q: Can Mauritius plant crops other than sugar cane, with our climate, cyclones, etc? <sep><sep> During these 5 years of Travayis reign, we have also found conflicts between the Travayis government and the historic bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The program that unites the trade union movement and the political movement is in a dangerous phase, the working class in a deadly dance. <sep><sep> When giving aid, the Government, UK, and USA need to renegotiate, divide it in half. <sep><sep> With a television, Paloma and her mother become a privileged family, beginning activities that the Diego family does in the evenings by watching television. <sep><sep> We salute the courage of all these volunteers, Deputy Lerop and international activists, many from Latin America, who have participated in the Freedom Fleet that was bringing humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. <sep><sep> Among the first conclusions we can draw from the analysis and history we have developed: it is when the State has separated three issues that are intimately linked and inseparable. <sep><sep> The USA says we need to eliminate this committee because we need to reduce United Nations "overheads". <sep><sep> Young militants, among the work they do is to ensure that decisions taken by the government are implemented, and at the same time, if they are not being implemented, they are looking into and understanding that there is a problem. <sep><sep> As usual in his news conferences, Bizlall does not make any mention of another "Collective for an integrated fight" that he started several years ago. <sep><sep> Today, they leave territories occupied to go work in Israel and then eventually return. <sep><sep> For example, in the police force, there is a military structure with a hierarchical system that oppresses male and female police officers compared to other work sectors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Is life a feast separated from its mother's life? <sep><sep> But a bit, it reflects, after all, the economic policy of a government, and we all know that Alliance government has a pro-capitalist policy, even though it protects certain capitalists more than others. <sep><sep> Representatives of Doctors of the World were talking in favor of having mobile clinics. <sep><sep> The working class must, together with its vanguard, act together with a political party that represents its interests and not the interests of other classes. <sep><sep> Money for advertising from the government has been allocated in a selective way to fund pro-government publications. <sep><sep> Who was in the Minsters' Cabinet with him? <sep><sep> Then in the FSSC, he faced another challenge from Imrith against Benydin, did not succeed, took 4-5 unions, left, formed another federation. <sep><sep> He is speaking in a public meeting, in a solitary moment, where everything is happening in a ritualistic and slow manner, and with a breeze. <sep><sep> Within the Social Alliance, the Labor Party has elected 32 MPs, PMXD 2 MPs, MMSM Dulloo 2 MPs and MSD Baichoo 2 MPs. <sep><sep> We find that the people worldwide must continue to fight against the big multinational companies that are pulling the strings themselves, with American military aid, and on the behest of IMF, the World Bank and WTO. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and officials began informing the population about the existence of the Rape Crisis Unit in the Casualty departments at Candos Hospital and Jeetoo Hospital. <sep><sep> Its program, its democratic structures, and its working principles. <sep><sep> While the Minister of Outer Islands has to know which procedures are to be followed to visit the Chagos, given that the country's Constitution defines Chagos as part of the national territory, which has been reaffirmed in the new Local Government Act. <sep><sep> In 2006, Mauritians experienced a depreciation of the rupee by more than 25% in one year. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we have noticed that the MMM has started a hysterical campaign against this amendment. <sep><sep> It was only at 18:10 that a white van (15 seats) with 5 uniformed police officers and 2 civilians descended from Zheng's place, left some documents, and quickly drove off again. <sep><sep> And mainstream Mauritius politics has abandoned economic, political, and social grounds. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said that there is a vital issue that neither the government, nor the parliamentary opposition, nor the press are addressing. <sep><sep> If this doesn't put you in the "political class", then it is a funny definition of the "political class". <sep><sep> Lalit has also formed a party to boycott Israeli products, which has begun to gain worldwide support. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the election, his argument, Ram Seegobin was invited on the RFI radio to discuss the 'model' of Mauritians in the election context. <sep><sep> As such, on the campaign money, the company's slogan "Bizin servi Larzan Lerop pu KREE ANPLWA PA DETRIR ANPLWA", this Larzan Lerop size is currently a reality. <sep><sep> There are bees everywhere where tomatoes and cucumbers are grown. <sep><sep> The government has officially announced that the mother tongue will be used as a medium - meaning to learn size and literacy - in schools. <sep><sep> Like La Commune, not just in Paris, but in the communes of Lasinn, in Ongri. <sep><sep> Vijay spoke on the "progressive boss", the step that MMM adopted before going nationalist, where he started shouting "one people, one nation". <sep><sep> For example in 2008, because unions have for many years been advertising the concept of paternity leave (5 days) as a new right, it has been granted. <sep><sep> We will explain the way in which the government is putting pressure on the election in the declaration of respect for the election in constituency No 3. <sep><sep> This amendment is like a virus that will destroy the State and public institutions with communal logic. <sep><sep> Now, when you go to protest together with Pravind Jugnauth and Berenger, what are you doing? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes the word "work" refers to a physical thing, something we can touch. <sep><sep> We believe that all schools and colleges should become equal. <sep><sep> Here is a paper: It begins with a situation: "Only through fundamental changes in the health system, where the pressure on the planetary surface that poses a real possibility of avoiding ultimate ecologic destruction." <sep><sep> when it recounts daily details, it also reflects on the sanctions that have been imposed with the time that has passed. <sep><sep> But, this claim gives a slightly stronger idea of the reasons why a legal framework is needed to work in a capitalist system. <sep><sep> Unions have entered into this logic that needs to be licensed, providing people who are licensed with opportunities. <sep><sep> And when this happens, it is only corrupt prison guards who are killed by the mafia who have the power. <sep><sep> On the verge of everything, with Palestinians, others, services, taxis, and buses in a lake beyond the control of soldiers. <sep><sep> The MSM Directorate is messed up with Soodhun because he said things against the MMM. <sep><sep> Certainly in the event of a violent crime as serious as this, where there is theft, assault, forced sodomy, conspiracy, kidnapping, and where violence by more than one man is more common, the DPP is obliged to take the case to the Supreme Court. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since March 2010, the government has decided to acquire a ship to create a hospital for senior citizens, a geriatric hospital. <sep><sep> Therefore, there is a need to plan ahead for this trend, to strengthen our side, to make people understand that PT-PMSD, MSM, MMM are not to be underestimated. <sep><sep> His speech was part of the launch of the new "LPT Lespas" that all members and sympathizers of LPT have created together in the last 3 months. <sep><sep> It pointed out that together, the earth has lost value in America in such a drastic way. <sep><sep> Minister Sithanen proudly announced that he has raised a lot more money this year. <sep><sep> But he also noted "The other voices," then noted that this is not the official Lalit website. <sep><sep> We agree that Week-End has been very biased for over 30 years, in favor of MMM. <sep><sep> At the beginning of 2012, Xavier Duval announced that he is conducting a study on what the newspaper has called "the potentially explosive Euro Zone crisis." <sep><sep> In the newspaper, Ashok Subron talked a lot about percentages; he claimed that almost half of Lalit's members resigned. <sep><sep> People around the world have been participating in their actions since 2001. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There must be an ability to justify, to convince even more people that these claims will represent the solution to our problem. <sep><sep> You have a slight advantage over Ble-Blan-Ruz Aneerood Jugnauth, with whom they have (ironically) formed a coalition 3 years later, in any case. <sep><sep> But this 3rd level indicates that workers will only get their rights through a class political struggle, through seeking political power. <sep><sep> However, in his press conference, Bizlall invited workers to come and support their trade union for Labor Day in the Taxi Square in Bobasin, without saying that the union is organizing the assembly. <sep><sep> This is how Timi started his political career. <sep><sep> The central and regional government also need to ensure a good distribution of animal food so that there is no black market. <sep><sep> The trade union, on the other hand, does not automatically create conditions for socialism. <sep><sep> Would a long lasting war also be possible without foreign intervention? <sep><sep> Today when there is a drumbeat, but also serious issues and processes based on the concept of Moris Island of Dreams (MID), it becomes interesting to read and reread this poem. <sep><sep> In this case, MMM no longer plays the 100% bourgeois card. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he felt that they would now eat in his hand, he asked them what according to them should do to check and control the Dharam Raj police force. <sep> <sep> The first location he got, he made contact. <sep> <sep> Many, many organizations, many individuals, have brought their contributions. <sep> <sep> He said there must be a socialist revolution that will end this type of global domination. <sep> <sep> Most people will say, "Language is a means of communication." <sep> <sep> At the beginning of the year, the GWF mobilization was held on Mars 10th. <sep> <sep> Question property issue: workers working on land must have control over decisions on what to plant. <sep> <sep> When my eyes opened, I found myself in a tiny, cramped house, on a mattress. <sep> <sep> A living worker is working and a dead worker is working, who has lost his name, and he makes this reality when his name is called "the machine that is part of capita. <sep> <sep> What is happening in the campaign when people who are not working are taking the land, taking the land for the IRS, taking the land for speculation, turning agricultural land into residential areas, and many people have lost their jobs? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT, for 4 years now, as you may know, has been analyzing the systemic crisis in the Mauritian economy, with a focus on the textile and sugar sectors. <sep><sep> Clearly, Minister of Industry, Yatin Varma, wishes to introduce a law, especially when the DPP has announced that it is difficult to prosecute under an existing law. <sep><sep> Just before the elections, there was a well-publicized demand to have 30% women in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> We also need to alert everyone in the Indian Ocean Region to the Pelindaba Treaty for a Nuclear-Free Africa now in effect. <sep><sep> Afterwards, he gave an interview to the newspaper where he said he was "done with the union movement". <sep><sep> The bank said "Alright, you have a good job, here's your loan". <sep><sep> Present at the LALIT Press Conference were Rada Kistnasamy, Alain Ah-Vee, Ally Hosenbokus, Cindy Clelie, Ram Seegobin, and Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> This determines the way we view class society. <sep><sep> Today, at the beginning of 2005, we can say that all the major classics of Marxist economic theory written between 1847 (The Communist Manifesto) and 1917 (The Russian Revolution). <sep><sep> The children have shown us their uniform and have shown us a second game a bit like the cup game, and we have drunk the lemon juice quickly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That's why we should focus on this issue. <sep> <sep> Vehicles cannot enter or leave the village. <sep> <sep> The excessive electricity rates imposed by the electricity supplier and the Central Electricity Board that consumers have to pay. <sep> <sep> Its second facility to ensure its longevity is its ability to send its employees and members of its household to the MSM, when the MSM is the strongest, and return to the Labour Party without causing too much damage. <sep> <sep> And Lindsey said, and gave him a copy of the interview. <sep> <sep> So today we are in a situation where the capitalist system has become bankrupt. <sep> <sep> Similarly, in another location, in 5 years, it will be withdrawn. <sep> <sep> Conflict between the Minister of Technology, Mr. Pillay, and the Chairman of Mauritius Telecom on the issue of prices and liberalization of this sector. <sep> <sep> However, I believe that instinctively, especially in Mauritius - people know, people are very happy to follow politics. <sep> <sep> But, especially one thing that I have done in the beginning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But unfortunately, a friend who was coming from Reunion Island who went to stand in the municipal election there. <sep><sep> There will be seven wise men who will listen to testimonies about negative remarks about children when they use their mother tongue in school, and they will make their findings public afterwards. <sep><sep> The PRB report has created frustration among all civil servants and para-statal workers and unions are preparing for mobilization. <sep><sep> But despite that, there have been several radio programs focusing on the economy. <sep><sep> In 2005, the Social Alliance had PT, PMXD, Dulloo Party, Baichoo Party, FTS, MR: 6 parties fought against 3 larger parties: MMM-MSM-PMSD. <sep><sep> But, it has always been difficult for him to take power. <sep><sep> But, what will happen if you go for separate negotiations? <sep><sep> And we are developing a political coordination, an internationalism. <sep><sep> So, the WANTED group leaders have started reinventing the game, with 20 points "We want everything correct". <sep><sep> "This is the 'lof' that Cuttaree is actually preparing in secret. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And if Berenger believes it is possible to obtain a great wave of international solidarity for Mauritius to regain the Chagos without at the same time dismissing the issue with global hope for peace. <sep><sep> To create a strike among workers in the security industry is not easy unless you get strong support from other unions in that sector. <sep><sep> There is a strengthening of MSM, so Pravind is making a strong push. <sep><sep> We symbolize it as a laser beam crossing with a hammer. <sep><sep> They have a tendency to ignore problems and demand for their sector in isolation instead of encouraging the unionization of all sectors. <sep><sep> "The economy" decides not only the "price" of each objective, each goal, but also its value - its value in utility, and also its value in humanity. <sep><sep> And many people still don't know that it's already like this. <sep><sep> It can be said that nationalized sectors, despite ideological debates and campaigns by the media, such as Telecom, Air Mauritius, and SCB have done relatively well. <sep><sep> And there will be more pressure still because we have already started to hear from a Finance Secretary. <sep><sep> This scenario has already made the Opposition unstable as Leader of the Opposition needs to be able to rally behind him a majority of opposition deputies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He wanted to do a degree in Paleontology, a field that was very new at that time and only a few people were doing. <sep><sep> ISSUES CONCERNING THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. <sep><sep> He has also uncovered another scandal in the way the Labour government under Tony Blair abused its power to re-appropriate in 2004 what the colonial government illegally did in 1965. <sep><sep> Since that day Kamini became interested in him, not as a woman interested in a man because Kamini was not interested in flirtatious guys. <sep><sep> He wanted to gain some experience in real life. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, in all the cities, towns, we find Bangladesh, China, Madagascar workers working in construction, in leisure. <sep><sep> Historic political blocks that have been in power for more than 60 years have recently started to break down. <sep><sep> When there is this fatigue since conditions and peace settled by NRB until through negotiation, all kinds of problems are arising. <sep><sep> So, we are predicting that we will enter a political crisis period, forming part of this systemic crisis. <sep><sep> They are able to block this development, but in the end, Ah Teck won the Lottery. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> In the sugar industry, a new centralized molasses and VRS preparation plant is being set up, with numerous skilled artisans and workers. <sep><sep> There was no talk of it being sick. <sep><sep> With the MMM proposal, this will open the door for bayer de fon, technocrats, and candidates that some people referred to as "sponsored marionettes" to be on the proportional list. <sep><sep> The global food crisis will worsen over time and will be even more serious in Mauritius, with an energy crisis involving fossil fuels finishing and delays in the development of solar energy, wind, hydro, etc. <sep><sep> And after a committee has decided their case, after a minimum of 2 years, that is after 6 years. <sep><sep> LALIT made this "great leap forward" when it identified the suffering of all children when their mother tongue is repressed, not just children with difficulties in school. <sep><sep> Serge Jauffret, from UASI, who was also invited as a speaker, did not manage to attend. <sep><sep> But look! A new leader and his entourage more corrupt than ever. <sep><sep> - The historical bourgeoisie established on the strength of mostly owning good land and all the molasses, which also controls other sectors of the economy (especially machinery imports, food, fertilizers, pharmaceutical products, etc). <sep><sep> or records as the case may be, to be translated into English or French for the purposes of enabling the Registrar to exercise his functions". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And very often, there are people who are not too happy to enter this wilderness. <sep><sep> Here he determines, on the other hand, by how much work has gone into producing these goods. <sep><sep> Why has America initiated the peace process, re-started negotiations between representatives of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas (who is practically a pro-American person) and Israel? <sep><sep> With the comrades of the Lalit Detid Group, we are each trying to develop certain concepts that we find in books. <sep><sep> all voluntary teachers who have organised, run and nurtured our literacy courses and at the same time contributed to the development of the pedagogy that we are using now. <sep><sep> And it was in Horl that Alain Ah-Vee made his speech where he placed Creole language at the center of the celebration. <sep><sep> RA - Resistans and Alternativ are still waiting and envisaging strategies for Electoral Reform following a dramatic deadline in the press. <sep><sep> When I say that the trade union had an inspirational element, the people who took part in it at that time are saying, "Why are there employers, Government and the state that believe in it?" Everyone is saying. <sep><sep> Eventually they become more popular, encouraging communal division among the population. <sep><sep> On the 3rd day, the bosses make them do the same thing, come back to the office. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (If you want to receive an invitation, contact a member of LALIT.) <sep><sep> LALIT has been running a campaign for 5 years on the need to create this kind of stable employment. <sep><sep> We stayed on the road in two groups until 9 :30. <sep><sep> instead we get children who can reflect to understand the world around them, to look for solutions to change the world and to change it. <sep><sep> The bank gives you the money, you sign a document indicating that you have the right to it, worth Rs 500,000. <sep><sep> Many have mastered technology to put these products either in bottles, in bags, in wooden crates or in plastic bags. <sep><sep> There is a private network of cistern trucks that deliver water if individuals can pay Rs1700. <sep><sep> I don't make this call to national unity, I call it chauvinism. <sep><sep> He tells you to do all this and he tells you "That's what democracy means." <sep><sep> Dirty Zone France, where 50,000 people work for Rs 3,027 per month, for a long time working. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Afterwards, as people started playing with the emotions, tell yourself what you need to get, what you need to get. <sep><sep> Now we will need to seek the approval of the British Government to file a case against this scoundrel, or if his grandmother has enough money. <sep><sep> In a confederation, there are 7 federations, then everyone benefits. <sep><sep> So Mauritius too, MSPA is asking for support to come back. <sep><sep> The conflict takes shape when the Government encourages CEB to increase electricity production rates that do not fall within the IPP framework with the establishment. <sep><sep> In their court, they built a little edge where Nann was giving lessons and where they were holding neighborhood committee meetings. <sep><sep> In the Lalit Economic Marxist Court Saturday 12 February, Lindsey Collen gave a detailed introduction on "What is peace?" and "What is capital?". <sep><sep> Lalit has suffered an amputation from these two blocks. <sep><sep> He found this was not paying, so he became nationalist, and bourgeois nationalist, in the period 1978-79. <sep><sep> Comrade Vijay: In his expose, Rada was explaining this special deviation that existed at the time when there was a social consciousness. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the Middle East, NATO and Israel are making many preparations. <sep> When you go to a demonstration with MMM on a problem of 100 workers in DWC, what are you doing? <sep> Very rare in history have we found such a political expedient, with the Zini State putting so much emphasis on an individual representing a Constitutional institution like this. <sep> Here in Mauritius, all individuals are different in various ways. <sep> Engels demonstrates how the State only takes shape when there is an "excess" in society. <sep> This problem of an association called FREEIT.ORG it also has developed a faction internally without any debate. <sep> A member of a family has been corrupted, and then their personal role is to support the family legacy. <sep> Before this, according to their Linked-In CV, they even worked for the US. <sep> We are pleased to find that when some editorialists understood the strategic implications of Resistance to the Committee on Human Rights in UN, they at least put a safe distance from this conflict. <sep> Take a service to the village of Marda to find the coordinates in the village. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The British government in Parliament has said that they will not detain anyone here because otherwise the US government would tell them. <sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna also went outside Caracas. <sep><sep> Where we need to strengthen and give ourselves the ability to have a voice in a very serious situation for the working class when the capitalist system is creating disorder in human life. <sep><sep> The European Union is limiting production and exportation of its own discretion, so that it complies strictly with the WTO court. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said that the "winning formula" he has will be best for the people, and will not propose any program. <sep><sep> In the country Kamomia, there was another kind of problem. <sep><sep> LALIT did a lot of work against Apartheid, and we participated in SOMAAP and FRAAP, from both sides. <sep><sep> Lalit is organizing a film screening and debate on Wednesday 17 November 2005 at 6.00 p.m. at Orl LPT GRNW on life in the shadows of apartheid that the Israeli state has built in Palestine. <sep><sep> But most importantly, Timi had gotten caught in a trap where drug traffickers were selling drugs and goods. <sep><sep> It is in the license that it is supposed to ensure the welfare of the people who vote for a government, so you had to believe that it was "democracy". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This allows the speakers three main points to guide Lalit's participation in the General Election campaign. <sep><sep> And this production is expected to reach 50% of the actual. <sep><sep> It's not a crisis that can be solved by changing a few people, or by changing parties in government. <sep><sep> People still remember the arrests of trade unionists, attacks on journalists, threats to cut freedoms. <sep><sep> It makes you believe that it is giving more democracy to the economy, but it is simply increasing the number of capitalists. <sep><sep> -The bourgeoisie, a bourgeoisie that becomes stronger through controlling the state, most often directly through the Labor Party (not only in cane and textile, but also in commerce, industry, construction etc). <sep><sep> LALIT, we participate in elections sometimes it is a tactical decision, each time with elections it is not easy for us to survive politically. <sep><sep> Shimanda Mungur and Nilen Vencadasmy are publicly in Block 104, a group formed by Rezistans and Alternativ (RA). <sep><sep> Because if we look at the factors that are affecting the environment more, one of the most serious is energy production, whether it is diesel, coal or bagasse, or for example to see how many cars, planes, boats etc are using diesel. <sep><sep> 2. What the government needs to do is to regain ownership and control of these 4 key industries (Medine, FUEL, Bel Vue and SUDS), with one goal, among others, to encourage diversification and food security; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Given the consciousness of the workers employed, they were extraordinary - meaning they understood what they were being asked. <sep><sep> There was an international inspection conducted by all of us. We all know Doctor Baradei. <sep><sep> The Second Factor Award that determines their circumstances. <sep><sep> The Registrar stated that, according to the law, it is not permissible for unions to financially support a political party. <sep><sep> They are not in a position where they can propose alternatives. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, during that week, another operation organized by the American Embassy has taken place where a meeting was held to attract young Mauritians. <sep><sep> A sector that creates jobs quickly, produces locally to face food crises, and at the same time creates employment in a moral setting. <sep><sep> But it was clearly evident to everyone that the key issue was at the root of the problem. <sep><sep> Rama Sithanen's strategy to "open" the economy has exposed all industries, all working sectors, to the global economic crisis. <sep><sep> During the 2005 election campaign, we had already warned that prices would rise due to the rupee's depreciation, resulting in an increase in unemployment and massive layoffs in the entertainments sector, as well as the closure of traditional and textile sectors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What can I do, God's work! Without knowing who, how, why a person ties a shoelace in a certain way. <sep> <sep> I understand that it is rare for a woman to be able to take care of children speaking in a certain way in Africa and in other parts of the world, women are organizing to resist occupation. <sep> <sep> Navin Ramgoolam has often made it known that he wants to finish his term, that is to go up to November 4, the parliament dissolved by him. <sep> <sep> without even exercising the European funds that the government is giving it, to create jobs. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin: Here in Mauritius, in the 1940s-50s, among the mass of people, there was a political consciousness, a class consciousness, which was very high. <sep> <sep> In an article to analyze the PRB Report in Le Mauricien on October 15, Bizlall takes some space to make his usual grotesque comments about a member of LALIT who signed, on behalf of LALIT, an analysis of Electoral Reform and Second Republic. <sep> <sep> When we find that their point of view is in the White Paper on IRA behind a language that everyone in Mauritius does not necessarily understand, this presumes for us to continue our demands on the use of our languages. <sep> <sep> Everyone needs to hold hands with their comrade, from the side, then cross hands behind their backs. <sep> <sep> A minority, lives by stealing the work of others, controlling that stock, putting those two together, and making a greater stock of it. <sep> <sep> Dangerous or not, I have decided to let my vision guide me. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is what they mentioned in their Budget Speech in paragraph 296: 'Targeting will also be extended to the subsidy on SC and HSC examination fees. <sep><sep> We have also observed the role and political presence of SAJ since he slipped into his shoes in Reduit in 2011. <sep><sep> His book is a compilation of speeches presented at the Theoretical International Seminar organized by LALIT on 25 June 2006. <sep><sep> Through this amendment, section IRA, which made strikes illegal, becomes unconstitutional. <sep><sep> His second deep language was in the struggle against apartheid. <sep><sep> To explain the existence of an abusive relationship, he explained it through the dependence of a family on its partner. <sep><sep> Crossroads, you see Karann, prevent him from losing his way; If you see Karann, prevent him from stopping a train that would crush him. <sep><sep> When SILU goes, when Lepor goes, it's the same total suffering. <sep><sep> He also wanted to say that a bourgeois landlord abandoned in Russia in the time of the Czar in 1917, is in the same class as an entrepreneur in the BPO sector in Cybercity today. <sep><sep> This capitalist reality that we have just described is in crisis today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are well aware, we feel more Mauritian when there is competition, when we dance, when in other countries, when there is a cyclone. <sep><sep> The meal was delicious: octopus, stuffed bread with pineapples and lemon, a hint of garlic in olive oil, custard dessert. <sep><sep> With the work carried out by the Creole Academy of Mauritius (AKM) in 2010-11, today there is a strong push for the Creole language to become a launching pad for education. <sep><sep> In the past, the MMM-MSM Government had already done important work where a Technical Committee had decided on a Language Harmony, a standardized orthography, presided over by a Committee on Vinesh Hookoomsing. <sep><sep> Then, the situation does not allow.' - 'Country children weigh on their parents.' - 'Why do you say that?' - 'An old story.' - 'What story?' - 'You know, a long time ago, before she got married, your father had a little bird. <sep><sep> So, how come came up this idea that chance Marx did not insert his reflection into the natural landscape? <sep><sep> He pointed out that there is a conjunction between these typical excuses and justifications. <sep><sep> This book has also been released in a Creole version, a Creole-English version, and an English version only. <sep><sep> "Soviet" had another meaning at that time, which had nothing to do with what Stalin did to make the USSR what it became. <sep><sep> The context in which we are holding this Conference is quite particular, it is in the context of celebrating Independence and the Republic. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A significant event, in 1952, the classification of 'General Population' and the segregation of the 'Indo-Mauritian' and 'Sino-Mauritian' communities took place. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna's smile quickly reignited hope. <sep><sep> 1,000 dunums of land (the equivalent measurement for acres, I do not know the conversion) were bought by Israel through force. <sep><sep> Upon hearing the stories shared by comrade Lindsey in the last strategic seminar on 1st of June, one can realize the significance of each story, and the work experience of worker Anne. <sep><sep> At that moment, Infinity had not consulted or included the "executives" for November, December, and January. <sep><sep> We have also worked as much as possible with other associations, especially where the women's movement and trade unions are front and center. <sep><sep> Severe condemnation against Bush and the US Government for supporting the state of Israel. <sep><sep> And we will always support Israel's right to defend itself against legitimate threats". <sep><sep> Precisely because where there is a concentration of workers, there is social control, which also represents a military, police, and legal control that frames the system. <sep><sep> To conclude this section, I would like to salute the strength of the comrades who were part of the Editorial Committee of the Lalit de Klas Review at the time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since Bush came to power, America is adopting an ultra-militaristic policy and is positioning itself as a true imperial power in the world. <sep> <sep> In 83-84, they used repression against the Lalit campaign which had started to develop a strategy based on dissent. <sep> <sep> Since 1983, we have had this strategy, and it's working. <sep> <sep> The Commission has already looked at many cases where there are allegations of discrimination, whether it's in recruitment, promotions, or dismissals. <sep> <sep> The Nation, the Boolell newspaper, has a similar stance. <sep> <sep> Differences between various demands from U were found, indicating that one request can encompass various dynamics. <sep> <sep> And then they stop, the Motherland people everywhere, saying, they are breaking the coconut husk. <sep> <sep> Educational research shows that schools need to provide 6 - 8 years of instruction in English and French as a prerequisite before teaching Mathematics, Science, and Economics in this medium - as if children must have a strong foundation to learn through curiosity. <sep> <sep> It is located near Diego, in a corner of the Marine Park with other small islands. <sep> <sep> At a time when the capitalist system is still entrenched, amidst an even bigger crisis, it and its government are trying to make the working class bear the burden of this crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They used to live in a reality where the worker drove his own company. <sep> <sep> Yousouf Mohamed got the shock. The cart passed in front of Ziz Seetulsing. <sep><sep> Jean-Claude thought that all forces needed to meet to relaunch the democratic process but at the same time he knew it was already too late. <sep><sep> They agreed, and we ran a good campaign. <sep><sep> Its difficulty would have faced what is a section 47 2 (d) of the Constitution of Mauritius which places this First Schedule on the same footing as fundamental rights. <sep><sep> In 1983-1984, Lalit embarked on a campaign on agricultural policy, where we did slide shows. <sep><sep> Those who are unionized, they hold their meetings, just like the executive of the Lepor did, then make a decision on when to lift the military embargo. <sep><sep> He wants to say that children try to acquire what is shown to them through English and French, schools force them to destroy their linguistic progress in Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> - Meanwhile, the crow's beak is always losing its color. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He mentioned that the Sithanen budget does not have the same national issues like somaz and unemployment. <sep><sep> What the government and employers call "social", should not be separated from "economy". <sep><sep> Clearly, Xavier Duval is acting as a spokesperson for employers (especially in exports) who are demanding measures to depreciate the rupee. <sep><sep> It has even come to a ridiculous situation where Ashok Subron and Serge Jauffret are on the negotiating table with Shakeel Mohammed, while Jocelyne Minerve, who was in the same negotiations, is working outside. <sep><sep> To fill in this vacuum, we are blindly heading into chaos. <sep><sep> To put it in one sentence: it makes you become outside yourself. <sep><sep> In the face of all this, when we look at the situation in Mauritius, especially on a great first of May, which do we find? <sep><sep> On that day, he says he "does not beat", he says he uses psychological and scientific methods. <sep><sep> On the occasion of the WORLD CREOLE LANGUAGES DAY, 4 organizations, Federation of Pre-School Playgroups, Fondation pour L’enfance Terre de Paix, ABAIM. <sep><sep> AGOA provides preferential access to manufactured products in Mauritius and 48 other African countries, including our T-shirts, underwear that may enter the American market duty-free. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, wait, what is the role of the police in preventing such types of violence inside the home? <sep><sep> There was a generalized conspiracy to do anything that could prevent Berenger from becoming Prime Minister. <sep><sep> They were just waiting for their moment to come with a damning accusation. <sep><sep> Because we are successfully combating theft, we believe the law is a good thing because it protects us from theft. <sep><sep> 4 different members of LALIT prepared 4 dishes with a distinctly Mauritian flavor. <sep><sep> The present pretext is that it is "useful to protect the sea from oil and other first materials that America wants". <sep><sep> MMM, for electoral reasons, does not defend the historical Creole bourgeoisie, but it nevertheless agrees with the historical bourgeoisie of the West. <sep><sep> The LALIT party has delegated one of its members, Alain Ah-Vee, to participate in a Conference in Ahmedabad, India, from 22 to 25 January where he will investigate how LALIT can serve as a different group and bring militarism to their country and the world. <sep><sep> On Tuesday, 10 May, at a Press Conference of LALIT at the LPT building in Grand River North West, Rajni Lallah launched a "program book" that will guide LALIT militants during the electoral campaign. <sep><sep> She spoke about the use of the mother tongue, saying that when it is suppressed in school, it is absurd not to speak Creole in Parliament, and an affront to our collective memory when we have to do minutes in French. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that 40% of workers today are working for a small entrepreneur. <sep><sep> And is continuing to draw a handsome monthly income in Creole, with his website being more filled with profoundly written texts in Creole. <sep><sep> Besides working in offices and shops, everyone was saying their names looking for water. <sep><sep> The Obliz Tablisman is reorganizing his office to allow plantations to enter the agricultural land on the cane. <sep><sep> They will be licensed by a VRS 2 system (Voluntary Retirement Scheme). <sep><sep> Israel, with the help of the USA, has consolidated its position in Cis-Jordan through its "Miray" and its colonies, while it is also organizing a retreat from Gaza. <sep><sep> This may plunge us into the crisis we fear. <sep><sep> And on other occasions, such as the mother tongue in schools, where it maintains absolute language proficiency. <sep><sep> Immediately after an energy crisis with oil prices nearly $150, as well as increases in the prices of essential goods and food. <sep><sep> So, we ask the question: why does Navin Ramgoolam want to have a 3/4 majority as he is used to saying he wants? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT, we will continue mobilizing to force the government to reorient its economic policies towards food production on a large scale. <sep><sep> Let's take as an example the formalities of a conversation when someone gives us new information. <sep><sep> When 'Mauritianists' say that all Mauritians must regroup under the flag of 'Mauritianism', they are bringing together workers and employers on the same platform. <sep><sep> It has also exposed the mansion issue where the State of Israel stands on the grounds that Hamas is doing this. <sep><sep> The Privy Council will start sitting in Mauritius from the present year. <sep><sep> Because of this, in our three minds, Sadou Prenses Prathna has always been a small and big thing and the idea was constantly in their minds. <sep><sep> The literacy has given Timi the greatest confidence in her life. <sep><sep> Then people meet in the Central Committee, in the Commission, in other institutions, every 15 days, every week. <sep><sep> There is also a contest, with ESC saying that it has to decide who the winner is based on the "merit" of its seat and that the winning candidate must submit an affidavit affirming that the community he represents. <sep><sep> When he speaks, he will talk about the Fourth International, an international organization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He represents a threat to peace for the people of Mauritius and other countries in the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> A Financial Minister is being appointed to handle the population outside the country to find jobs. <sep><sep> It's somewhat rare for us to accept sitting on an issue that the State has initiated. <sep><sep> There have also been a series of arrests, arrests for various criminal offenses. <sep><sep> *The government needs to invest and get people to work in food production and agro-industry to transform and preserve food; here too, we do not want a bureaucracy to dominate but democracy. <sep><sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna have explained how their visit here was organized by ICA - a Kibin institute to develop strong solidarity with organizations from other countries. <sep><sep> As things are right now, we find it necessary to hold this Press Conference to clarify our stance. <sep><sep> However, there were two recurring problems that often prevented Timi from sleeping: the unemployment market and squatters. <sep><sep> We also find it important to denounce the irresponsibility of previous governments. <sep><sep> Now, at the moment of your arrest, you have the right to legal aid. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So it was a very important period and it was also a time when Marxist analysis, class analysis was becoming more widespread in Mauritius mainly through the MMM which since 1969, 1970. <sep><sep> But, the year that followed, they all, in the police service. <sep><sep> In South Africa, there was only a dictatorship from the 23rd to the 42nd, 35th. <sep><sep> Every year, the Chinese government imposed pressure to close military bases. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, he had a problem with alcohol, but he overcame it, stopped drinking. <sep><sep> Taking a certain amount of privileges, withdrawing them from former ruling classes, keeping them, and finally the lamas found it broken with his hope. <sep><sep> Given the systemic crisis in which we are, which will become even more dangerous, we must, at least think of having a force from the Government to finance the MBC / TV breakdown in two languages, Kreol and English. <sep><sep> We can also expect labor disputes when finalizing candidate lists. <sep><sep> The Advance group placed a candidate against the Labor Party for the first time, but it eventually launched a takeover bid on the Labor Party in 1953. <sep><sep> The Chinese government, after sabotaging the Indian Ocean project, began to influence the politics of countries like Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mauritian Creole is not yet officially recognized, but it is an optional language, so the language needs to have its spelling, grammar, and vocabulary. <sep><sep> Google has already introduced people to email addresses through Facebook during the movement in the rest of Tahrir Square, a name Waed Ghonin. <sep><sep> We should not start classifying children, their parents, their teachers between races/religions when we speak the mother tongue. <sep><sep> There was a moment when the Sega music was so much fun that Karann said to Karonn: "Wow! I want to dance." Karonn replied: "Wow! I'm already ready." <sep><sep> We need to differentiate between demands and requests. <sep><sep> so it is good to promote each economist in his work - all this is not a weakness. <sep><sep> Here is a group of people in the Bush administration cabin and their connection to large capitalist companies. <sep><sep> He put on traditional costumes for all the different ethnic groups to show that he was just like them. <sep><sep> There is also a confusion of class, or rather a strong consciousness, where many people in writing, from Gilbert Ahnee to Finlay Salesse, believe that they are "bourgeois". <sep><sep> So all students who want to follow a university course, can follow, and in return they must work to develop their land/region collectively. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Provide us the necessary organizational capacity to carry out this program, implement this strategy. <sep><sep> Since the year 2000, MSM-MMM-PMSD have shown that they are truly in the American corner. <sep><sep> And this collective struggle, their struggle that unions have signed on behalf of all workers with employers. <sep><sep> Because people also their share, a tenth of the share over there. <sep><sep> And Alain Ah-Vee, on the panel, he has already been to Pelindaba, when they shut him down. <sep><sep> - In the case of Kanal Dayot, where the LALIT building was, we have a concrete example of how bureaucratic blockages can be responsible for regrettable events. <sep><sep> Depending on the times during one of those bananas, if it refuses a work loaf that the work bureau offers it, the allocation is cut instead. <sep><sep> We had said that it is not repression that will solve the problem of lawlessness in this country, but better housing. <sep><sep> Today these 2 sectors no longer have price guarantees nor market guarantees. <sep><sep> And class struggle is the struggle that people exploited bring against this exploitation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And, a grave side effect of this destructive policy, is the emergence of a literacy rate of 40% in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen agreed with this position, and explained how these organizations that begin to share subsidy money play a key role in the progress towards community sharing and establishing relationships between religion and politics. <sep><sep> LALIT is distributing this first track as part of the campaign for the Partial Elections announced for the 29th of April 2005, to replace Chady. <sep><sep> When the Chagos Refugee Group won a victory in the year 2000 at the High Court in London, it had a great importance in the balance of political forces. <sep><sep> Imprisonment forms part of our society, in that sense. <sep><sep> Or else people find that they are having difficulty in whatever they say, because they are in a job that does not pay enough. <sep><sep> So, when we do this work, we develop a series of what we call "front lines", battlefronts, at times. <sep><sep> There are moments of calm, idyllic, but they are too calm constantly and make us fear that something terrible will happen. <sep><sep> Additionally, what is very important is that Barack Obama is a politician who was elected on the basis of just 2 points of a program that made his victory extremely important: <sep><sep> LALIT: Not only gather, but come together and reflect and act together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are different connotations in each language that correspond and pass through society. <sep><sep> Yesterday was never just a bib, it. <sep><sep> He was among the special guests of Martin King who reminded of the devotion with which Kamini, a nurse at the Central Hospital, took care of him when he was very ill. <sep><sep> A work that has been finished for a long time, since before the general election, to show that this crisis is coming, while it is coming and when it is finished coming. <sep><sep> That's why many children are not happy at school, leave it, do it. <sep><sep> Elements in the press have worked according to the bourgeoisie agenda. <sep><sep> And this privatization is also a key to attract international investment. <sep><sep> We have already developed a program that presents an alternative. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, we are observing some worrying actions from the US imperialist maneuvers in Mauritius. <sep><sep> MMM has not been able to overcome any economic or political different phases of crisis on crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a way to refuse the President of the State of Israel's request to postpone his Miray trial. < sep> <sep> Because, there is a rule now that this is not true. < sep> <sep> And we have found how the Workers' Party is represented as a "state bourgeoisie", meaning it serves this Post-Colonial State to favor different sections of the emerging bourgeoisie to consolidate themselves, but with a very particular historical bloc around it. < sep> <sep> Now, the boss can't just offer a truck for transport. < sep> <sep> It was a bit surreal when we were sitting under the trees at the edge of the pond, drinking coffee and eating figs while the tears jeep passed. < sep> <sep> A vegetable market is passing, the mosque calls the azan or the soldier tears announces the coup. < sep> <sep> Take someone for a matter that you psychologically model, convince him, make him buy into your "project." < sep> <sep> The government is doing everything to impose its economic policy. < sep> <sep> We call on all workers and non-governmental organizations to avoid communal conflicts and refuse to get involved in meetings of local and sectoral assemblies. < sep> <sep> Release political prisoners unconditionally, including National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi; < sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And just like Advance had its newspaper, this group had its own: L’Express. <sep><sep> Recently, MMM Paul Berenger, in his proposal for electoral reform, took an identical position to the Blok 104 affidavit approach. <sep><sep> Because when I did research for this speech, I found that he really did an extraordinary job. <sep><sep> And where everyone is becoming aware of the nature of the campaign and how it is unfolding. <sep><sep> Then an entire village is imprisoned in their homes while the army is guarding a 'protected' visit that has become a prayer on Jacob's tomb. <sep><sep> The trade union movement in the sugar industry has been accepted and is even advertising VRS, advertising Blueprint. <sep><sep> Otherwise, we are heading towards a very, very serious social crisis. <sep><sep> All this means that the Government has abdicated its economic and social responsibility, and has rather decided to protect the private sector at all costs and to harm all the people in the country. <sep><sep> But there were also those who thought his approach was not meaningful and it was rather demagogic because Caprinin had a great ambition for Jericho at some point and he certainly wanted to light the flame. <sep><sep> 8 He passed anti-union laws to weaken the strength of workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are many ups and downs to get to where you want to go. <sep><sep> But the real problem was in the wheel bearing; the bearing was like an engine that was spinning uncontrollably. <sep><sep> However, they have no reason to stop anyone, when they stop him. <sep><sep> Many had to leave, not happy, crying because they had to leave. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the legitimacy of the President of the Republic comes from the legitimacy of the political majority of the National Assembly. <sep><sep> He made an appeal to young voters to do as he did: reset all blocks, and vote for Lalit. <sep><sep> Many people went missing after the meeting ended. <sep><sep> The Chagos residents are seeking compensation for the heinous treatment they suffered when they were evicted from Chagos. <sep><sep> Even those who were not aware of this issue were having difficulty breathing. <sep><sep> He referred to the way the Prime Minister gradually eliminated power from all his Ministers, then seized power from the President of the Republic. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Ministry of Education has started to use the mother tongue in its preschool sections and has also started training teachers to use the mother tongue in 10 of its primary schools from 2010. <sep> We took a stance to criticize the petition organized by UNRAW-SPEAK, which we believed was giving the USA more power, even in other places such as Chagos, besides Diego Garcia. <sep> We have the right to disagree with what a regular citizen does and thinks, but we need to agree that the equal system is "correct". <sep> Is this campaign not being used for the Zini State to prepare for the upcoming natural disaster? <sep> Today, we can also include the request for Minister Aime to go back to the ship all together. <sep> A decision was made to convene an International Conference on the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace in Colombo, Sri Lanka. <sep> Ship the book with valuables and planes with their team with nuclear missiles. <sep> In LALIT, we are saying that we need an economic and political alternative that will make agricultural development and dependence on a large scale. <sep> We are not saying that the slave has sold his labor force and his mother. <sep> Devianand Narrain and Alain Ah-Vee talked about the Education for Workers.  <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When you accept capitalist logic, you are playing a role as a revolutionary socialist. <sep> <sep> When it wants to, it can put a veil on it. <sep> <sep> Because if I have to tell my life, tell my suffering, it's a book of 365 pages. <sep> <sep> This will help us develop tactics and strategies that will advance the struggle, advance the historic mission that the working class must bring. <sep> <sep> In addition to losing his job, Kolet also suffered when he lost his land, the land where his house and family used to stand. <sep> <sep> The only reaction that has been there since Hurnam's party, MMM, is Secretary General Collendavelloo, who has adopted an ultra-legalist attitude and at the same time declared that only Hurnam himself should decide what he should do. <sep> <sep> The need to produce food Mr. Monty has said that instead of importing at a high price, there are several food products that can be produced at a local level. <sep> <sep> A man can marry 4 women at once, and if he wants a 5th wife, he can simply divorce one and marry another and start a new family; <sep> <sep> So if there is internal democracy in the union (which clearly does not exist) then another management will take control of the union in this sector instead of ruling with a minority, sometimes very small, by the worst manipulation. <sep> <sep> Rama Valayden has left, fortunately he was about to take a decision, but he is no longer General Secretary. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When appropriate, LALIT has taken the initiative to coordinate action with former President of the Republic, Cassam Uteem, particularly against Israeli aggression. <sep><sep> He has shown his political prowess, if he becomes more powerful after a municipal election, his chances of entering the government increase. <sep><sep> The challenging team, has found it difficult to succeed, as negative vibes have developed that are hard to shake off. <sep><sep> Allegations of corruption, Lindsey Collen is not implicated at all. <sep><sep> When we look at 1936, we didn't see class struggle, we only saw our problems as workers, all united for one cause. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the results of the last General and Municipal Elections have brought the MMM to represent the electorate, especially the urban bourgeois class, especially in Beau Bassin-Rose-Hill. <sep><sep> The young leaders were encouraged to say what others were hiding behind closed doors. <sep><sep> A member said that for a good while now, the workers thought that either Mr. Trade Unionist, Mr. Deputy, or Mr. Finlay Salesse, many people for a while now thought that these individuals could save them. <sep><sep> But like LALIT has successfully resisted when fundamentalists and xenophobes, together with the State, attacked LALIT by targeting Lindsey Collen, once again LALIT is coming out stronger from this new situation. <sep><sep> And the press does not show the public that it is a ridiculous matter. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And so far apart we are as individuals, we will not be able to galvanize a nation as we desire. <sep><sep> Like all teachers of primary schools had to leave their homes very early in the morning to go to work and return late in the evening, they shared all the work at home. <sep><sep> It is a symbol of the difficulty that the political bloc, Lalyans Lavenir, is going through. <sep><sep> This is propaganda that is fading because of the "status quo," as they no longer have any arguments. <sep><sep> We know Mr. Patel made a speech with his shareholders. <sep><sep> If he is correct, it is essential to pursue him, as we are all equal before the law." <sep><sep> This is the issue that Fron Komin pu Lavortman chose to address for its 1st Debate Forum organized in the council chamber of Beau-Bassin-Rose-Hill on Friday 19th. <sep><sep> But even for these people, our proposal is still an advantage for them, for their children. <sep><sep> You are making people forget that it is Pravind Jugnauth with Berenger who started this process that brought the Lalyans Sosyal where it is today, where universal subsidies are being withdrawn. <sep><sep> During the electoral campaign, the Labor Minister and Deputy descended to the ground to campaign for Pravind Jugnauth, who won a resounding victory with great enthusiasm. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he returns, he starts a website for other federations. <sep><sep> So we have instability because we have a regime that is no longer dominated by Workers. <sep><sep> Furthermore, we can say that it is normal for LALIT not to work too closely with the leadership of any trade union bureaucracy over a long period of time. <sep><sep> In a speech at a meeting, Navin Ramgoolam was going as far as the refrain 'Stop eating the grass of hard work'. <sep><sep> Employers continue to appropriate a party of work values that everyone else creates with their everyday courage. <sep><sep> This watchman today shows that Mauritius is also being stung. <sep><sep> He has also exposed the role of the US government in supporting the Israeli government in the occupation and illegal construction of that barrier. <sep><sep> Delayed Trwazyeman, now there are 2 counter-reburs playing on the government. <sep><sep> According to Code Pink, which is coordinating logistics for this international action, international delegates will enter Gaza on December 29. <sep><sep> Let me express my happiness to you, still happy to you ... too late. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian Government has accepted the presence of military bases. <sep> Instead of an alliance with "Israel" as MSM/MMM is predicting, constitutional amendments risk provoking dynamics similar to those in "Lebanon"! <sep> As for an alternative economy, they do not know of such a manifesto already in place since 2005. <sep> The government is also encouraging the establishment to move forward with the construction of shopping malls in certain areas, also on good agricultural land. <sep> And this is what we have managed to accomplish, up to a certain point, despite the pressure and media scrutiny. <sep> Face mass demonstrations with Lalit and Movement for the Liberation of Fam Lane 1977-81, the most spectacular mass displays, more political, together with Lalit and Movement for the Liberation of Fam: <sep> There can be 2 teachers (each with a different mother tongue) sharing 2 classrooms, so that every class has two mother tongues. <sep> I only have three expressions that I would be happy to contribute to today's debate. <sep> In the book, for example, u will have the chance to read a wonderful article by Jean Claude Bibi, a former member of Lalit de Klas, who explains in detail. <sep> He said that he had read many books on Palestine, but when he read "Partitioned Palestine", it was the first book that had really affected him so much in his ordinary life living under Israeli military occupation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, a working-class organized demonstration must be aware that there is a need for this political struggle. <sep> <sep> You know, as we fight communalism, we must not forget that during many banana bunches, 50 years ago, this "community" was found with religion. <sep> <sep> If we lose this "millennial" knowledge, we will not be able to regain it. <sep> <sep> Because otherwise, how would Berenger become Prime Minister, explaining 33 criticisms against Cehl Meeah? <sep> <sep> He would make bureaucracy even stronger than democracy. <sep> <sep> In other words, they did not have "rights" all the time, but a small favor that now cannot be afforded anymore. <sep> <sep> But what the contract also mainly determines is 3 things: <sep> <sep> There has been a terrible rise in the price of groceries, more hunger. <sep> <sep> But now, there is a difficulty for young activists, being able to explain many things, and things that seem complicated in a clear and precise manner in a tight time. <sep> <sep> Suddenly, unexpectedly, a little boy about ten years old stands in front of the microphone; when he starts to speak, a silky voice envelops them all. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Just like a rose, she studies the rose, then she acts. <sep> <sep> Member and sympathizer of the LPT, representing various trade union organizations and also in the presence of people in the educational and cultural field. <sep> <sep> Kamla did not want to make her parents suffer, but sometimes without realizing it, she was saying or doing things that made her parents sad and upset. <sep> <sep> What is the duty of the MMM, one will not be able to stop it on its strong course. <sep> <sep> So, what the Minister of Finance proposes to reduce the gap between rich and poor, is that people in misery must wait to receive a "handout". <sep> <sep> -Big sugar planters without money (who also own means of transportation, etc), who are emergent bourgeoisie, and who have strict conflict and total dependence with Tablisman. <sep> <sep> We started working together as enemies to start JUSTICE in a specific period: after the death of Kaya. <sep> <sep> (a) Conflict in '82-'83, when Berenger as Minister of Finance implemented a policy that favored the historical bourgeoisie with facilities to process Bagapel Beau Champ. <sep> <sep> The Agricultural Marketing Authority for marketing agricultural products, not disik. <sep> <sep> If we had recognized that since then, we could have prevented it from getting worse, making it what it has become today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The crime has already been exposed in detail and at length. <sep><sep> A good part of it has its very well-developed democratic structures. <sep><sep> -An electoral reform guaranteeing the elimination of the communal bestloser system. <sep><sep> And often, their story is not that of people used to saying, 'go down the street', they themselves do not know what it's like when people go down the street. <sep><sep> This second element that needs to come together, is not automatic. <sep><sep> Our Program also includes our "5-year political balance sheet". <sep><sep> France does in Mauritius as the USA has already done in Seychelles. <sep><sep> We have a human rights organization separate from politics, for example. There is an organization like Greenpeace, which takes care only of species conservation and the environment, separated from a political analysis. <sep><sep> And again, no journalist has even asked them. <sep><sep> We have to advise all NGOs to refuse to take this US case. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, PLHDWU is against it. However, PLMEA is, he agrees. <sep> Last week, Yvan Martial is writing an article, the article is a bit significant, but interesting because it's about that episode. <sep> Yesterday Wikileaks exposed how the USA have "blackmailed" France to deploy its military presence in Mauritius, because for the USA it's a bit more difficult to do it. <sep> Regardless of the gathering based on religion, community, or even worse on race, there should be a "common language" to have. <sep> In 2004, we already received a rare award, UNESCO World Literacy Prize. <sep> He even created a new word, "rendering", to mean when a prisoner is handed over in secret to another country for torture. <sep> There are also places where there is supervision, magistrates, probation officers, etc. who control people. <sep> A time this sector was organized by the EU, but with a lot of difficulties, and with a very noble language. <sep> Navin Ramgoolam is on the defensive and is acting by using more repression and threatening language against those who oppose his politics. <sep> These two votes are necessary to convince everyone that working for a living must be mobilized, otherwise the bourgeoisie will lead us deeper into disaster. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Its entire literary heritage is a more precious heritage than humanity has. <sep><sep> In England, Blair never became as unpopular and this is because of his role following America into the Iraq war. <sep><sep> Whether it deteriorates working conditions, threatens unionism, or increases poverty, it is essential that the class struggle aggravates and perpetuates it, yet it perpetuates itself on the basis of principles. <sep><sep> That means from January 1 to January 7 all workers are on site. <sep><sep> Even in a period like this, where there is no great class consciousness among workers, even then, the political level and class consciousness must exist. <sep><sep> Look at how they're comparing this "do not walk" situation. <sep><sep> The third is a "pedagogical" workshop that will delve deep into the various creative pedagogical methods used by LPT, one by one. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we believe it's important to start campaigns and initiate debates on Alternative Economic Policy. <sep><sep> The second working principle is: "Go read, or re-read Marx and Engels, Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Trotsky, Antonio Gramsci. <sep><sep> This means we lack militant means to make people aware of our program, our party, our strategies, and we lack strictness to make people aware of our program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the contrary, SLO provides avocados in Rodrigues when Martine Desmarais pressures. <sep><sep> Then children who were dying were starting to release these sweets. <sep><sep> - But is this in a context where there is relative abundance? <sep><sep> But it's all useless if there is no public transport system by bus to the interior cities until late at night; and it needs a transport system that subsidizes so that it is reasonably priced. <sep><sep> This sea rally is organized by an International Front to End the Illegal Blockade in Gaza. <sep><sep> Once a year, twice a year we have a Seminar where we work for 2-3 days. <sep><sep> They claim that crisis symptoms (corruption, fraud), if attacked, will cure the crisis. <sep><sep> The government called Jagdish Koonjul Mauritius and gave him the floor to vote in favor of the resolution America. <sep><sep> The limitation it faces is that the union is operating in a capitalist environment. <sep><sep> However, today CSG limem appears to have been paralyzed following internal conflict. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we are well prepared, the license is a great sanction, a great mobilization on the basis of an anti-capitalist and pro-socialist program, it is more necessary today than it has ever been before, that it is in Moris, that it is at an international level. <sep><sep> Then he will say yes he favors Sithanen's proposal. <sep><sep> The talks (you know everywhere has those!) were making everyone believe that someone had sent him food or, if he wanted, given him a helping hand to stop breathing. <sep><sep> This REVI is following the old series of CLASS STRUGGLES and REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLES, with its number being 95. <sep><sep> In this Committee there are 12 countries that are in the Indian Ocean, besides Lasinn and Zapon. <sep><sep> The way we visit these places is to help transform class consciousness (which is currently very weak) into political consciousness and even revolutionary consciousness. <sep><sep> Discussion on amendments to the ERA law, there have been demonstrations by CTSP and JNP/GWF, all at the same time. <sep><sep> There are two types of values that everything in capitalist society has. <sep><sep> In addition, more often than not union bureaucracy is emphasizing amendments that affect bureaucratic trade unionism rather than opposing all laws that allow employers to force workers to work longer hours for less pay and lay off workers more easily. <sep><sep> When Ramgoolam spoke stubbornly, he angered the PMSD. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We support the Chagosians in their fight for their land rights, and we believe that their fight for the right to return is now more critical than ever with the military base issue, which is why the Chagossians have been expelled from the Chagos, and why Mauritius has filed a claim. <sep><sep> So often this is the role of a woman in a political party. <sep><sep> We have produced a small book on economic alternatives, focusing particularly on agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> on MBC, sharing of development and certification 1,000 rupees with all workers, subsidized fuel, first home ownership scheme and distribution of state land to all kinds of religious and communal organizations, using ministerial resources for political propaganda. <sep><sep> It will come when the government has a majority when an electoral reform is in effect a ¾ majority. <sep><sep> The Leader of the Opposition, Paul Berenger, also expressed his agreement. <sep><sep> They asked him to become their main adversary because everyone else was resting. <sep><sep> We need support from England, France, America, especially in the world for this work. <sep><sep> What he has said has exposed the violence of President Bush's comments. <sep><sep> Repeating the issue of electoral reform would only introduce a single loophole. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is happening in Sri Lanka is not an isolated case. <sep><sep> Jean Claude de L'Estrac is resigning from Le Sentinel, and Gilbert Ahnee has resigned as Editor of Le Mauricien (he is going to Le Sentinel, but it is not yet clear in what position), and Jean Clement Cangy has retired. <sep><sep> * Establishment of a new concept called "private property" as a means of serving society. <sep><sep> Creating situations that may not work out, is not advisable. <sep><sep> However, the mistake being made here is that you can introduce these concepts for a while through propaganda, but you cannot eliminate the reality of exploitation that people bring against oppression. <sep><sep> The Class Struggle tendency, very alive here today, was shifted by the MMM blockade when it was found that the MMM, which was taking up class struggle before, from 1980-81 onwards. <sep><sep> On the other hand, in Ut, we were ourselves present, on the Independence Walk when we organized a vigil march with former President Cassam Uteem against the military aggression of the Israeli State in Lebanon and Palestine. <sep><sep> We will end with another National Platform for salary compensation, in which there will be MMM, MSM, and UN. <sep><sep> The reason why Cameron wanted Navin Ramgoolam to sign once. <sep><sep> To get out of The House, where I am still living once again, there was a long time where the only way out was through the olive grove path. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In his very speech Bidze, when he says that a major problem that arises "only" 50,000 tonnes of steel, he is not wrong. <sep><sep> Today in England, in America, there is a powerful anti-war movement that can bring 3 million people to the streets like this. <sep><sep> All this shows a high degree of bankruptcy in our democratic system. <sep><sep> What Lerwa Ramgoolam says, the same thing – the Labor Party has no position on BLS, the Government has even less of a position, the State has even less. <sep><sep> Many unions make workers believe that unions can make you win anything. <sep><sep> And even if it made him a deputy in the "Parliament" under colonial rule, his political power has been built on this political and union mobilization since 1936. <sep><sep> And this will be a party that was created to fight communalism, although it exacerbates it, it must instead strengthen its yellow communal bases to keep its various electoral supports. <sep><sep> According to us, there is no doubt that Paul Berenger will be the Leader of the MSM-MMM Alliance. <sep><sep> And yet, despite the end of Civil War, 100 years later, blacks have started fighting. <sep><sep> They have started negotiations to merge. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Trade Union Trust Fund (TUTF) has been another instrument that was responsible for bringing union divisions and creating a new federation. <sep> <sep> He had a disabled child and his family rejected him because he was married against their wishes. <sep> <sep> Three Sadhus were arrested and as they were doing good, they preferred to wait for the sun to rise. <sep> <sep> and where we take a position in favor of decriminalizing homosexuality, decriminalizing abortion, so that everyone can feel free from the State. <sep> <sep> He enjoyed writing poems and comic sketches. <sep> <sep> and it is the UK and the USA that have illegally acted and have violated all UN regulations, are keeping watch over the nuclear issue in Diego, and have rooted out the Chagossians. <sep> <sep> The former oligarchy always had a "pardon" from the State for everything its members did. <sep> <sep> and Ministers like Sushil Kushiram, and like Bérenger, like Pravind Jugnauth, who as Finance Ministers of the former MSM-MMM regime, had started speaking that language for the first time when they were spouting nonsense. <sep> <sep> Given the constraints of time, I will focus more on the "Bourgeois State" in this session. <sep> <sep> We need to unite people on a class basis, Alain Ah-Vee concluded. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are reclaiming rights against the British Government in a British court. <sep><sep> But, with the Carcassonne Report, there will be developments on Electoral Reform. <sep><sep> On the 13th of June this year, almost 3 months ago, Ashok Subron resigned from Lalit, and after him, a dozen others followed. <sep><sep> What has happened in Mauritius, he explained some points that Comrade Yves highlighted. <sep><sep> But, what has happened, what is passionate, is when he finished annotating his work, when he went back to re-read Marx with these allegations in mind. <sep><sep> One morning, after a period of stability, with a big smile, Aziza announced that she believed she was pregnant. <sep><sep> African Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, (Pelindaba Treaty) -UN General Assembly document A/50/426. <sep><sep> And immediately she made sure that all activists of LALIT from SILU-UASI and GWF were informed. <sep><sep> Consciousness against communalism in the electoral system has increased significantly in recent years. <sep><sep> When we say "full guarantee" we mean that the profit is guaranteed by the Government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A coconut tree can live up to 1,000 years if well taken care of.<sep> We received many international messages, and from other organizations in Mauritius.<sep> It is true to say that in Mauritius there is a social class, an intellectual bourgeois elite that often forms the social basis and a particular political party that has momentary importance, and also the main newspapers.<sep> However, since the 70s, the parties were quickly dissolving.<sep> Once a week, you can attend 3 meetings.<sep> In the mills, from 22 down to 6, all those workers with a lot of trade union experience left.<sep> Finally, in 2000, Ziz Seetulsing strongly advocated for the amendment of that law in Parliament once.<sep> In other work areas, LALIT has recently published an article on the successive fragmentation in federations and trade union confederations, where certain roles of trade unionists are located.<sep> Why not! When Ganga was talking to Sir Ralph, he just gave a little smile and told his wife that she should know where his priorities were.<sep> what an economic crisis because of the overproduction of diseased fish that was causing Mauritius as a country, a regular global financial crisis. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The State of Emergency has been declared in Pakistan, and Musharraf has once again been appointed Chief Executive. <sep><sep> He tells the capitalists that the Workers want to be favored. <sep><sep> The victory we have achieved, along with Education for Workers, is finally when the Creole language has been formalized in education, this script is being used. <sep><sep> I will tell you the time when it will go down, he will regret it. <sep><sep> We all remember how the US security services almost took control of everything, including several Police Departments. <sep><sep> They are seeking to divert all economic, social, and natural resources to serve their own economic interests. <sep><sep> We in LALIT are insisting, in this context too, putting forward demands for land for workers' VRS and a Blueprint for them to be able to collectively plant in the form of large enterprises, together. <sep><sep> Its backbone is facilitating a development that is not under historical bourgeois control. <sep><sep> "You feel a freshness and tenderness that still emanates from this poem, a poem that remains for me a small literary gem. <sep><sep> 17 Nov 2011 - Navin Ramgoolam meets Paul Berenger to discuss electoral reform! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 5th Demand: "Freedom of Information for the People" Act. 
<sep><sep> Particularly it appears that he intends to write in his report that Kaya has minor injuries and there is no sign he has suffered any violence. 
<sep><sep> For example, Lindsay Riviere, when he was editing Week-End (Le Mauricien), always praised MMMSP every time MMM did something in favor of working class. 
<sep><sep> Why does PM Berenger not want the voters of Constituency No.3 to exercise their democratic right to elect a replacement for Chady? 
<sep><sep> We discuss on the food crisis, on economic problems worldwide. 
<sep><sep> The press even blames you, when you do something so simple. 
<sep><sep> Here, every present organization (anti-drugs, environment, peace, Article IX (article in the Japan Constitution which states that the country will never have a military or an army). 
<sep><sep> It was crushed mainly by the revolution in Russia in 1917. 
<sep><sep> Surely, it was a black kite looking for a piece of its bait, which everyone knew belonged. 
<sep><sep> In this absence of mobilization, in this absence of national debate, we find that Rama Sithanen operated in a rather unusual setting, a setting determined by Navin Ramgoolam and Paul Berenger, and they are looking for, politically. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have acquired more experience in the field of campaign development. <sep><sep> This makes it even more difficult for a judge of the Supreme Court to determine whether someone belongs to a particular community by observing his lifestyle [as required by the Constitution]. <sep><sep> All our family, friends and neighbors are starting to be affected by the pandemic. <sep><sep> JEC, with its leadership more aggressive towards GM, MEF, is antagonistic towards the government. <sep><sep> It is imposing its power by changing labor laws to favor employers, installing CCTV cameras in public places to monitor people more closely, building more prisons, and introducing a new Identity Card with digital fingerprints encrypted on it. <sep><sep> They have the possibility of going to Europe without a visa. <sep><sep> Everyone is very troubled about what to do. <sep><sep> The indications so far this year suggest that capitalist economy is continuing to sink into crisis. <sep><sep> In Lasinn today, the totalitarian bureaucracy of the Communist Party and the State has a monopoly on power and, in order to maintain their privileges, they refuse to let the working class and peasants have an independent voice. <sep><sep> We can wonder why there is this kind of State because during colonization, the State was light (in Loaland, in France, in England). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With an argument based on class equality and popular emancipation. <sep> <sep> This weak trade union movement is happening in an economic crisis context where the traditional sector continues to decline rapidly. <sep> <sep> There are all kinds of factors that can intervene between now and April 29th, making it politically impossible for PM Berenger to move forward with his plan to dissolve the Assembly. <sep> <sep> An alternative agriculture does not simply mean a rejuvenation of agricultural work, like a "return to the land" in a romantic way like Rousseau and his followers used to promote long ago in Lerop. <sep> <sep> They want to know why we in Mauritius are interested in the Palestinian people's struggle. <sep> <sep> Given Prime Minister Ramgoolam's attitude towards the British and US governments, it is not surprising that the government is not taking any initiative after this historic turmoil, which also represents a potential threat to sovereignty in the struggle. <sep> <sep> Justice is the association fighting against police brutality. <sep> <sep> When the working class weakens, and global unity weakens, especially because electronic machines have replaced it (an objective fate), then parties like the LALIT also weaken. <sep> <sep> The government is making workers bear the burden of the crisis in the patronage system, which is the responsibility of the employers. <sep> <sep> Socio-religious forces have joined forces to focus on goals, which they must achieve, as things move forward with reforms. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That said, they are saying, for the Zini State. <sep><sep> A Crisis that is bringing a work system on fewer days and a higher salary (compensation for less salary than CPI means a higher salary, and also the Employment Rights Act provides better salaries as well); <sep><sep> Therefore, somewhat inactive at times, but with MLF we network with them for 30 years. <sep><sep> However, in the 70s, behind this slogan and MMM political strategy that was closely linked to class struggle, there was this connection. <sep><sep> Does the term "Mauritianism", as a description of a culture, seem to become a political ideology, a political strategy to counter other ideologies? <sep><sep> - Dig a big hole in your yard and bury your physical self. <sep><sep> *Taxing individuals directly through income tax, those with wealth of course, those in poverty not just a small percentage but a larger proportion of their income; abolish taxes like VAT insistently. <sep><sep> There was delegation participation in several political conferences: the South African Communist Party conference, the anti-capitalist ecological conference, the Lalit conference. <sep><sep> "Is the Government killing Bhojpuri and Creole?" is the exact title of the book that LPT launched yesterday. <sep><sep> These 4 clusters will enable a series of projects, in agriculture, fisheries, refineries, ethanol production, and electricity production from bagasse (and coal as well). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we know that a common conscience does not lead us away from progress. <sep><sep> But, if you question the foundations of the law, you can find that behind all the laws, there is power. <sep><sep> At the same time when there were 2 attacks against A.Jugnauth in Stanley and Gran Bassin. And where D.Bahadoor (Human Service Trust) described A.Jugnauth as some "a tiny creature smaller than God". <sep><sep> We have workers who have already been in past strikes. <sep><sep> Whether there is less work, you will work for a 6-hour day. <sep><sep> After this meeting, Ragini Kistnasamy and Rajni Lallah had a technical meeting with Mr. Appadoo, the Minister's officer in charge of this case. <sep><sep> This is how we find certain discrepancies when transport worker unions ask the government to increase bus ticket fares to ensure that transport companies can increase their profits! How are we to find that Bizlall finds dairy and textile to be main sectors. <sep><sep> Yesterday when using the mother tongue, it develops reflective capacity. <sep><sep> This generation perpetuates violence, against guard, and against detention, as well. <sep><sep> In the education sector, at the primary level, we find that unions are demanding rights for private lessons. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The service from the grocery store on Zaterday brought us up to the crossroads of the village. <sep><sep> Naturally, those benefiting directly from the system are responsible for keeping it in check, especially those who directly benefit from it, they are responsible. <sep><sep> We know from the beginning that the boss will come to offer a lemonade, it is a fight that, when won, is lost. <sep><sep> There are all kinds of things that can happen that make it impossible for him to stay silent in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> Sometimes we tend to have our own ideas about being a political party, but our reflection, like what we are doing here in LALIT. <sep><sep> Almost every day, the ZeroDepo stores become popular on the internet. <sep><sep> MMM and the Workers' Party were not going to stick to these points in our program, if it were not for LALIT, through our branches and Commissions, year after year, we convinced a majority of people in the country. <sep><sep> When workers mobilize as a class to win their rights, then it is strong, then communalism disappears. <sep><sep> This is done through temporary resolutions of contradictions in the system. <sep><sep> Either there is a license or a board of directors that represents the interests of people who control capital, it has a relationship with production. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes we have a political party whose practice is to do nothing and avoid their program. <sep><sep> In that case, it should be the same to confront the consequences that may arise from the distress. <sep><sep> In reality, other forms of power intensify the influence over people in order to make them all bend voluntarily, convincing us that this inequality is not only "inevitable" but also "natural". <sep><sep> About fifteen thousand people participate in these movements. <sep><sep> When Issam, Alla, Namarik, and Samara speak, they remind us of the atrocities of the Occupation, when we hear how many members of their families and friends have died in the resistance to the Occupation. <sep><sep> And this depends on their strength - guiding this contest in a direction that can produce something progressive. <sep><sep> When the PTr Government is overthrown, in order to survive, they rally support on the basis of a clearly communal, sometimes racist, even a campaign against a bourgeois section. <sep><sep> The Medine boss has come to the press and stated that actually he did not want La Chaumiere, because that would ruin the development of his Hotel, IRS. <sep><sep> Given that we are always in a patriarchal society, where women are often responsible for nutrition, as if there is a way to take this responsibility, We ask: <sep><sep> What is more important is to look at the new legislation that exists, in terms of work, which affects people in their work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>During the 6 months, instead of continuing with the opposition to the laws that were voted in 2008, it – entirely - and all its logical basis - only opposed certain amendments of these laws. <sep><sep> The Lalit Party is saying that we need to put Lalit Diego on the agenda. <sep><sep> When I was in the West Bank in 2004, I met many Palestinian parents who recounted the same harsh reality of Israeli armed violence against Palestinian children. <sep><sep> We also held a special session to analyze the demands in the context of Tunisia for a “Constituent Assembly” in various historical contexts, in different countries. <sep><sep> They mobilized members to win the first Award for minimal working conditions in this difficult sector. <sep><sep> So what is now necessary is to abolish the compulsory quota in the Best Loser system. <sep><sep> We must mainly reverse the reality that when we wake up in the morning - more than 80% among us, we have to go and look for a job, otherwise we are at the end. <sep><sep> We shouldn't just say, "Well, that's a big thing, we can't do anything." <sep><sep> It is a duty for us to do to future generations because they will see life as a commodity. <sep><sep> This is a factor that has had a crucial importance in dismantling apartheid in South Africa. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MMM, MSM, PMSD, PT are all proud of that. <sep> This fragmentation, its anchors are rivalry between different bureaucracies. <sep> What we are talking about in general is that we all agree that there is a "downturn" in the class war. <sep> After the initial reaction, some say "yes, it is interesting," but very quickly everyone realizes that we need to reset. <sep> In a meeting with the private sector, it painted a different picture of various sectors of the economy, and found that it is in the French Zone. <sep>  What we are saying is that we need to combat the patriarchal system that has created this inequality. <sep> You are exposing your life, while I am making you look even more foolish. <sep> The excess involvement of the US embassy in all kinds of penetration in Mauritian society. <sep> It has talked about the need to mobilize to force the Mauritian government to vote on a motion at the United Nations General Assembly to refer the Chagos to the International Court of Justice. <sep> But also based on how we behave ourselves. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Momem, Lindsey Collen, went to an International Seminar on Lager in Johannesburg, where she talked about Diego Garcia and the importance of its location for a permanent political base in a political context. <sep><sep> We are telling people that there is a different relationship and way of life. <sep><sep> And this is at a time when we are facing a serious social crisis with widespread insecurity, rising prices, depression, and various other threats later down the line where there is growing pressure for devaluation. <sep><sep> They said how almost everyone used to have pets in the good old days of the 1970s. <sep><sep> - Between the positions of LALIT and the Green Fraternal Party on reparations for slavery. <sep><sep> So there are people in the world whose figures, returns, and dividends are astronomical. <sep><sep> LALIT is ready to provide assistance in building this kind of movement. <sep><sep> Only a 'United National Government' would be able to lead the country with thought and give hope to the people. <sep><sep> In the face of rising unemployment, it is LALIT that is proposing an alternative economy that does not depend on sugar and textiles, it is LALIT that is calling for unemployment benefits and pensions, and the right to strike for workers. <sep><sep> In 1987, there was an example that had become noteworthy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now they have started pouring sewage water on olive trees. <sep><sep> In the first week when only establishment anger will exist, there were delegate meetings in Port Louis from each establishment, 3-4 laborers, 3-4 artisans and this meeting lasted only one day. <sep><sep> In one year, because the economy of Mauritius is closely linked with Europe, between tourism, textiles, and agriculture, a crisis in the Eurozone will inevitably create problems in Mauritius. <sep><sep> our Family Commission, Diego Commission (which is initiating a front-end as a practice), our Youth Commission, our Palestine Commission. <sep><sep> Those who oppose progress, such as neo-liberals, lease capital, from capitalists in production and from global working-class. <sep><sep> Now, let's come together to sow love in the land of our country. <sep><sep> They came up with a new Bill that passed through Parliament. <sep><sep> and when we succeed in making the ruling classes shoulder the burden to get out of the current crisis where their economic policies have brought us. <sep><sep> 100 local women's associations in all villages and towns that are members of the National Women's Council have mobilized to support this bill to legalize abortion. <sep><sep> This little progress that our mother tongue has made in 2012 can help to stop us from drowning in this linguistic irrationality in our language. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Together, we understood exactly what we are targeting when we are bringing our campaign: how good our campaign is not only to "get" on each point, but we can make it "right." <sep><sep> As a result, despite its keen smile and understanding, as soon as a need arises, it enlightens its path. <sep><sep> * Privatization involving a significant number of public sector workers. <sep><sep> For example, in Iran, there is a democratic election; there is a President, but he is subject to the Supreme Council of the Revolution, which is not elected and consists of 100% of the very great Islamic theologians and their political title is Supreme Council of the Revolution. <sep><sep> So when we are thinking about the importance of this Municipal Election that is coming on October 2, we need to understand well this new political, economic, and social context in which we are. <sep><sep> The Zini government believed there was no problem if it had a budget deficit, while other Governments in other countries should not have debt, but it, did nothing. <sep><sep> and it should also include such a thing as vulgarizing laws and the Constitution, abolishing the death penalty. <sep><sep> The military has detained them in a long-range space in Checkpoint. <sep><sep> Otherwise, the capitalist system would have fallen on a grand scale. <sep><sep> The youth are the future of a country so, if you want us to have a promising future, you should treat the youth in a way that they deserve so that they work for a better future. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is almost entirely focused on the positions that MMM and MSM hold, and the Federation of Trade Unions is doing things to make workers forget. <sep><sep> Other countries' sailors have gone to play basketball against the Mauritian team, and the US Embassy has donated basketball equipment to the team. <sep><sep> For example, when there are different mother tongues in one class, what do we do. <sep><sep> But our program is coming out of reality and going back into reality. <sep><sep> And planning to introduce a metro-tram to bring about a general upheaval in the public transport sector. <sep><sep> It is an economic context where there is a serious crisis. <sep><sep> If he has money, if he wins the lottery, then he can regain a relationship with his production, and certain production. <sep><sep> This is what happened with the economic relaunch just after independence, and with the departure of many colonials. <sep><sep> And many people think that his "yearning" was even before that, in the time before 1976 when he made his debut as a deputy. <sep><sep> These measures have led to significant reports on the Enron company, which has been implicated in collusion with Andersen, an accounting company that has colluded to manipulate figures to show fictitious profits. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, when he defeated all his opponents he started shouting "cousin, cousin", "they will have total control, them". <sep><sep> Because, the majority of us, we were against this capitalist domination, which led to this apartheid. <sep><sep> When getting married is often more about powerful and wealthy parents dictating the rules of marriage. <sep><sep> And indeed, it has either completely overturned the monarchy as in France, or cut its power as in England, until it becomes a joke. <sep><sep> This will also satisfy all kinds of "vested interest" supporters and communal seats of power. <sep><sep> In the 30s and 40s, workers and small farmers together are organizing against the exploitation of the land. <sep><sep> Even though the Prime Minister has changed his position, and he publicly speaks in Kreol. <sep><sep> There are many organizations, many individuals saying that Greenpeace is a hoax, including LALIT. <sep><sep> That night Timi spent the night in her husband's bed. <sep><sep> There were many signs of a workers' movement against the system that caused these crises. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some say all this suffering is the work of God. <sep> <sep> This is how I knew LALIT, this is how I knew that in Mauritius too there is a group of people who are fighting for a better society, who value humanity. <sep> <sep> What Minister Soodhun said was simply a face-saving device against the critics that the Mauritian government is facing at the international level. <sep> <sep> For the past 4 years, LALIT has been conducting a campaign to focus on the economy rather than politics. <sep> <sep> It’s not just a matter of changing the “size” concept, but rather a different approach. <sep> <sep> Even though the press may find it funny that Lindsey Collen is not here today, it's because she was invited by an organization to go on a literary tour in Lautris. <sep> <sep> For the past 2 years in all press conferences, on the radio, in interviews, LALIT has been warning that the government and people have a very strong and determined view on discrimination and oppression. <sep> <sep> L’Express believes that it is necessary to ensure that the MMM is invited to events and that it decides who its leader will be! <sep> <sep> However, a smokescreen is being raised, meaning it was in the cards long beforehand. <sep> <sep> But, it is not easy for the Working Class to recreate it as she did in the past. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And they even opened an El Al airline, meaning an Israeli airline. <sep><sep> If the mother tongue is repressed in school (for example, through the absence of school books in the mother tongue), learning other new languages becomes very difficult for the child. <sep><sep> Changing underwear is a defined occurrence, not outside that occurrence. <sep><sep> On Tuesday, 27th April, 4 LALIT militants were distributing LALIT leaflets on the campus of the University of Mauritius, in the context of analyzing the LALIT model for general elections. <sep><sep> We need to evaluate his approach step by step as he is reorienting the economy. <sep><sep> These 2 international prizes are proving LPT right in our favor to promote the Creole and Bhojpuri languages. <sep><sep> Thanks to family organizations in the past years, cooperative societies, and now there are NGOs working to bring great progress for the community. <sep><sep> The results of the National Program for Bilingual Education in Guatemala have shown how students who learned in their mother tongue have succeeded. <sep><sep> A beautiful symbol, we can find it lovely, we chose it in the store, these products that have made it, that have won its heart, for it, it's so well done. <sep><sep> Many displaced families have lost their cozy places that are now forced to sell linen or cakes on the streets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Otur Beebeejaun, who comes from the MMM, also has significant influence within the BAI economic group.<sep><sep> Ramgoolam has not been able to approach the MMM for any pre-electoral alliances (before 2015) because he had too many people to satisfy as a Minister.<sep><sep> Today, we are reflecting on this class, where it is heading.<sep><sep> Moreover, within his "block", he already had the MPA (Mauritius Planters' Association) and SILU and UASI representing candidates like Bidianund Jhurry.<sep><sep> So, I decided to offer a helping hand, and I reflected that the working class has the potential, strength, and knowledge to ensure this sanction.<sep><sep> I also emphasize that he very clearly won this majority based on a mandate.<sep><sep> The resignation from Rodrig indicates that this was not discussed democratically within the party, but that’s because he avoided becoming involved in the Party's affairs when he was in Mauritius in March-April 2004.<sep><sep> Therefore, we had many reflections on strategic issues.<sep><sep> After this election, PMT has never held back the reins.<sep><sep> Unionism cannot diminish since it also affects the employer.</sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a moment where there is no large, widespread mobilization of the classes that most use the language, but even so, with a little help, it is at a time when our prayer will bring the Creole language to the National Assembly as well as to the Registry Office. <sep><sep> In a meeting organized by LALIT, on the 1st and 2nd of November, Rada Kistnasamy made a speech on the failure of traditional political parties to create an alternative economy to the textile and sugar industries. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy, who presided, said that on Wednesday, the 11th of November, the Full Bench of the Supreme Court overturned the verdict in the Balancy case regarding the Best Loser issue. <sep><sep> On Sunday, the 1st of May, Lalit held a gathering to celebrate Labor Day. <sep><sep> According to Addameer, the number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel continues to increase. <sep><sep> Monday, all sectors of the GWF, icons of all sectors of the FTU, are under attack, and there is a general strike now. <sep><sep> Other speakers were Veda Balamoody for MMM and Joy Beeharry for the Labor Party, and both were interrupted by shouts from the audience during their speeches. <sep><sep> As the country was heading towards general elections and there was no intention to field candidates, he decided not to resign as a councilor and member of parliament so that Dinesh would not be put in the spotlight. <sep><sep> In the car, we found Mayk, a farmer (aged 65), his wife (aged 60), and his daughter (aged 45). <sep><sep> Lastly, from last week, the Government has introduced a series of amendments to the Employment Rights and Employment Relations Acts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is not just our problem in Mauritius, here. <sep> <sep> It is for this reason that the USA, UK, and France have systematically sabotaged this process. <sep> <sep> How is it possible that, facing UK and USA naval offensives, one can keep secret one's own strategies? <sep> <sep> Nine members of the Laliberte Flotilla crew have lost their lives. <sep> <sep> The fact that it continues to do so all the time, this accumulation of work, he says, turns it into an "actor" in the process. <sep> <sep> They have also made fortunes from "windfall gains" through taxes on transactions when buying land and getting Mauritian citizenship for members of the jet-set. <sep> <sep> Where you are struggling for party representation, it could mean power for the community, and where for the community, for the party. <sep> <sep> Is this action the result of his plan, how has it developed? <sep> <sep> In Mauritius, unions, associations, the fight against authoritarianism, it is necessary for unity. <sep> <sep> EPILOGUE TIME PASSES Despite his age - he was in his seventies - Timi was in good health. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are many things I don't know, I don't understand. <sep><sep> Every time there has been repression against any member LALIT, the Party has shown total solidarity. <sep><sep> In this region, there are all kinds of colleges: government colleges, private colleges, denominational colleges. <sep><sep> Together with 600 other protesters from all over the world, they were surrounded by the police and tear gas. <sep><sep> But does the leader know what to do outside Parliament? <sep><sep> So when someone is elected, as this goal in the State, they must respect the institution of the press, despite the war that may occur, and that will happen. <sep><sep> We must know who has played, many of whom have been appointed. <sep><sep> Now, when taking a species "Mauritianism", which is not very well defined, as a matter that can go against communalism, supposedly fighting against communalism. <sep><sep> We easily recognize that there are negotiators who frequently make appeals to Navin Ramgoolam for his intervention in the industrial relationship. <sep><sep> Everything he initiated his FMP, PMT, COCU, everything. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> * At retirement age of 65, a policeman is at grade man for a period of 5 years. <sep><sep> They go to work directly in a group of 22 people in a car located under a mountain, elsewhere in the cliff, so communication, organization is difficult. <sep><sep> This means that, without a police union, hierarchical superiors can abuse with impunity, and make the police service of a country look bad. <sep><sep> So, this gives us another example, like the police force at national level, where the trade union movement affects the economy in general, and the economy in general affects the trade union movement. <sep><sep> The educational experiences of LPT, Playgroup, Terre de Paix, Prevok-BEC have proven that using the mother tongue as a foundation works. <sep><sep> In many African countries, for example in South Africa, multi-lingual politics have made great progress, and ACALAN can be a guide for our Academy. <sep><sep> Then, start turning to other areas as well, maybe the beginning of putting together all the reports, reports from other unions as well (are they holding firm to their commitments to attend meetings in a week?). <sep><sep> In 2013, with the tensions between China and Russia and in Brazil, China and India face serious problems in agriculture, we can expect a significant increase in food prices. <sep><sep> Many Ecuadorians lost their money in the bank, and emigrated. <sep><sep> Today we don't even have to worry about where they are buying, they can even let them close and set up a security company to watch over it, then sell it later. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, there were L'Express, Le Mauricien, Le Defi, MBC. <sep> <sep> But in today's contemporary era, one needs to ask oneself whether the working class has been informed about the shift from capital in production to financial capital. <sep> <sep> Who should decide what to produce?" and they choose to act on various other fronts - public gardens, decriminalization of ganja, best loser, primary "union" field in a somewhat restricted sense, the environment. <sep> <sep> In Ziyet, this month, Kisna and Yannick went on a Brigade, a revolutionary tour in Venezuela and Cuba. <sep> <sep> There is a list of State of Zion military interventions that are quite shocking and give an indication of the weaknesses of the capitalist system and its dangers for humanity. <sep> <sep> A delegation went to meet with trade union journalists to brief them on the actions of the Gaza Freedom March and the latest updates. <sep> <sep> We must remember that, among workers, all workers, all of us, in normal times, tend to believe that we have a special relationship with the master. <sep> <sep> This followed a national campaign against privatization led by Lalit. <sep> <sep> It caused a stir because fundamentally the Labour Party is above all, its main interest being that of the state bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> Therefore, we can see where we are going in the future more clearly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For this capitalistic section, enough force has been exerted against the historical bourgeoisie, workers had to seek real working-class solidarity. <sep><sep> And we continue our publications with the book party organization in the world. <sep><sep> The carpet under his feet became muddy, his lens and his slippers became muddy. <sep><sep> We find that people who represent different state institutions have changed because the government's police have changed. <sep><sep> We will have to integrate our analysis of these 2 new industrial laws to replace IRA and the Labor Act in our campaign for an alternative economic policy. <sep><sep> The evening ended with a small concert where everyone participated. <sep><sep> Note that Berenger recently used an increase in the powers of the President of the Republic as a trap in the “vals alliances” that were recently experienced. <sep><sep> Immediately take measures to support farmers who grow food and raise livestock. <sep><sep> A voice cried out: "We are breaking!" The crowd began to break the stage, garden; they started marching in the direction of Majakaro Square. <sep><sep> Lalit is beginning so that women and men have work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In situations like these, it disappoints people who are looking for union work. <sep> <sep> Indeed, the press will go as far as the pocketbook of the party that doesn't tolerate these frauds, which is Lalit. <sep><sep> With it, an archive of knowledge, a library of history, has disappeared. <sep><sep> and Lasinn, Canada, the Latin America and Australia in a second round of these times. <sep><sep> They ordered to say that there is a political training that is proposing an economic alternative to sugar, textile, which brings three years of enormous difficulty. <sep><sep> These riches are in all forms: books, analytical documents, articles, letters, tracks, speeches, and there are electronic documents on our website. <sep><sep> demand that answer the economic and social crisis that we predicted was coming. <sep><sep> there is a toxic substance found in certain fish and other seafood. <sep><sep> I can say a successful government has had, from Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam's time, what we call "predictability, reliability" and had a harmony in our policy for our fight so that our sovereignty is sacrosanct and our territory is not in peril. <sep><sep> When a mother cries for her suffering child, this brings a great curse. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Every time I listen to the radio, for a moment I think I'm in Mauritius and I hear an announcement for a meeting. <sep><sep> Village elections, as we know, have been abolished by this government. <sep><sep> And just like in the past, ever since the Advance Group took control of the PT, the party had a fairly good grip on two newspapers: <sep><sep> While in LALIT we call it "state bourgeoisie" (and we introduced this term in politics in our publication LALIT DE KLAS in 1976, and in the Review of African Political Economy, 1977), we are not saying people working in the state apparatus, no! <sep><sep> Our politics is firmly based on this, because we believe it brings progress to society. <sep><sep> Ally Hosenbokus assumed the presidency, and Alain Ah-Vee took the floor on behalf of Lalit. <sep><sep> Our experience in Bambu shows us that many young people, they clear, they make all kinds of efforts to eventually achieve a goal later on in Debreille, in a plot, for them to plant vegetables. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy and Alain Ah-Vee, who went to Palestine to participate in solidarity actions, testified. <sep><sep> 20 comrades Issam found death and Issam's mother and Alla lost 10 members of her family in a single blow. <sep><sep> When a family has ten men every ten, it is a recipe for disaster. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Although Lindsey Collen has never received any summons to appear in court. <sep> <sep> If we don't understand history, we won't understand anything in current society, nor how to change it. <sep> <sep> There are several narrow definitions, and there is a strong emphasis on what the state should be. <sep> <sep> In a LALIT Seminar on Sunday 31 August from 10:00am to 2:00 pm, Ram Seegobin analyzed the current global situation and Rada Kistnasamy analyzed the situation in Mauritius during the "Medpoint affair" crisis. <sep> <sep> In such a cold country, it's hard to adapt, but people are so hungry for life here. <sep> <sep> To establish a Rape Crisis Unit in all General Hospitals in Mauritius and Rodrigues. <sep> <sep> We have it in practice, in books, but it's no longer a hidden crime. <sep> <sep> The media and NGOs must not be complicit in this kind of propaganda. <sep> <sep> Hence, there is a significant difference in production, through work, establishing market and capital values, and the values of American money printed as a reserve by many countries. <sep> <sep> The machine gets blocked during elections and all the votes cast in that machine disappear. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One day, Balram was told that it was time for him to write his short essay of about fifty words. <sep><sep> But, we are talking about "work" in capitalist times because in capitalist times, work has become an activity that is not personal, but has become a social matter. <sep><sep> Sun Trust's owners even pursued the government and made the State, under the MSM-MMM regime, pay them Rs 45 million in damages for breach of contract. <sep><sep> All that the Government is proposing are measures to make money flow into offshore companies: all kinds of facilities and tax concessions to make and sell agricultural land (IRS). <sep><sep> This joke, it relies on Marx's analysis in 1859 on the fact that the economy is the "basis" of society. <sep><sep> [Here, someone in the assembly has interrupted to say that maybe he should call his column "Nonsense". <sep><sep> He wants to say that if they behave well in prison, they are eligible for a certain amount of time off their sentence that they have earned. <sep><sep> His democratization is challenging the historical bourgeois monopoly, challenging the monopoly of electricity production. <sep><sep> While Nann was talking on the phone, the sonet rang. <sep><sep> He also exposed how there cannot be real negotiations when it comes to the Palestinian military occupation, since the negotiating partners are not equal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bryan took 3 expressions, and he finally found out that a little bird told him that his friends Yves and Reeaz had understood that there is a global level of intelligence. <sep> He is responsible for saying that only 1/12 of people are not in a "shortfall", based on the fact that he worked less than average in the last week. <sep> Ram Seeogin said that there is a deep economic crisis situation, leading to political, social, and even humanitarian crises in different parts of the world. <sep> You cannot have vague demands, like asking for "more justice", for "better distribution", no. <sep> Yesterday, the US has put Seychelles under pressure, possibly signing an SOFA, behind the back of their people, their Parliament, and even - for the first time - behind the back of their Cabinet. <sep> Today, even though Prime Minister Paul Berenger is gaining prestige by preparing for SIDS and the Presidency, and Finance Minister Jayen Cuttaree is considering the possibility of becoming the Director-General of the WTO. <sep> Lalit has not yet submitted to either the Sachs Commission or the Collendavelloo Select Committee, as the MSM/MMM government has stated that the Communal Best Loser will be retained under electoral reform. <sep> A letter has been sent to Jaffa importers in Rodrigues. <sep> and which affects the possibility of a stronger military base in Diego until today. <sep> And it is true that the police need to take measures to rectify this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he went to apply for the police; 'No, you are not a Mauritian like you! <sep> Too often the State hides behind the excuse that it does not want to give the press information. <sep> In recent years, we have found corruption in the Indian Ocean and in Africa where in the absence of an organization like LALIT, only a few individuals have made little progress, and in some cases, it has even encouraged a clear political leadership. <sep> Here we never knew what secret funds were paying him indefinitely. <sep> All three sizes are still loaded with unanswered questions, and I do not think it will be answered in the near future. <sep> There is enough money to spend more than 500 million to redecorate the new offices of Prime Minister Berenger and President A. Jugnauth in Reduit. <sep> On the condition that the historic bourgeoisie did not interfere when "other families" entered the bourgeoisie. <sep> He was elected against the representative of the banana plantation owners, Álvaro Noboa. <sep> So maybe it was worth it today, when we finish looking back at all those political parties "while we are organizing," today we are only briefly reminded of a political party. <sep> There are countries where their NHRC has a monopoly on human rights, in licenses, an organization like JUSTICE has no right to exist. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They went to form the Front Sindika de Gos, together with RGEA in Rodrigues. <sep><sep> The Government has started the Morisyen Creole Academy in October 2010 with enough technical means to decide on the spelling to be used by the Government, describe Creole grammar, prepare children's books, provide teacher training so that the Government can introduce Creole language as an optional subject in schools. <sep><sep> The PT that we know today isn't just the PT of the past that brought union rights and universal suffrage. <sep><sep> We are also commemorating the 79th anniversary to show the strength of a mobilized working class, to show the power present in this mobilization. <sep><sep> Marxist literature can best explain the State. <sep><sep> NHRC has continued to refuse to make its "procedures" public, as is done by all similar organizations. <sep><sep> The Government claims that this measure is to have a control over consumer prices. <sep><sep> As work was moving smoothly, Timi was selling his goods to buy a bigger one. <sep><sep> In the courses provided in Mauritius, are we learning to use our knowledge, or are we learning by heart technical aspects? <sep><sep> It seems to be a problem that, in turn, brings all kinds of other problems with it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you take environmentalists, trade unionists, and other individuals, you bring them all together. <sep> People have to think and find alternative solutions, they will make the Government know. <sep> This is important, whoever is employed, because then, in this case, there is no transmission of experience from old workers to new ones as usual. <sep> It is not just appointing "tribal leaders" for 2008 to rank 3 in the government, but it is playing a dangerous communalist game. <sep> Alain Ah-Vee also said that in these actions, and in all our political work, it is to change the balance of power in favor of the working class. <sep> But, the State apparatus, the Cabinet Ministers, is mainly dominated by the MSM. <sep> This introduction will help us prepare for what is to come in the Wednesday session, meaning the 2nd of November. <sep> Focusing on women's liberation (New Women’s Manifesto, what it symbolizes) on food security (Focus on Food Security, a key Manifesto). <sep> Questioning how different International volunteers differ from agencies like USAID. <sep> When it was finally discovered that Enron's facade was hollow, several thousand people lost their jobs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Finance Minister has taken action to control inflation by acquiring foreign exchange, increasing the value of foreign exchange, and decreasing the value of the Rupee. <sep><sep> We have done a lot of work in the 5-10 years of the program, it may still not be enough effort to expand our party. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, COI chief Jean-Claude de L'Estrac continues to say that "Bolom Ramgoolam has sold Diego", suggesting that it is quite absurd that a leader of political parties in a colony (such as Ramgoolam, Duval, Bissoondoyal were) is more a representative of the private sector, as in the case of Paturau, had the authority to sell a part of a country that still does not belong. <sep><sep> The Labour Party has shifted from a Social Democratic movement to an ultra-liberal project. <sep><sep> It is a great risk and two legacy that creates a link between the Upper House and the lower house of parliament. <sep><sep> It also provided guidelines on the size of the tongue that has been present in our political education session and program meetings. <sep><sep> During a Press Conference on Saturday, January 26, presided over by Cindy Clelie, Ram Seegobin announced the INTERNATIONAL LALIT CONGRESS 2008. <sep><sep> Often in LALIT we say in this situation, Great Britain, the British State, has acted like a thief, it took the Chagos, and America acts as a reseller because it received things that were stolen. <sep><sep> They have tortured and carried out renditions with kidnapped prisoners over there. <sep><sep> What has the Mauritian government done to uncover the truth about Kaya's death? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> In Mauritius, like in any other international country, for example, what is happening in Spain where the weight of the capitalist crisis is shifting onto the shoulders of workers and the poor people. <sep><sep> Instead of MIE, there is an institution that promotes the mother tongue; it is creating a professional training team. <sep><sep> The British government has issued an Order in Council Law for the first time to prevent Chagossians from going to Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Even Karinn, who was initially hesitant, eventually joined in reluctantly. <sep><sep> A political education series in Flacq finally ended last Saturday, November 22nd, with a very interesting session led by Alain Ahvee on 'What is a Political Party'. <sep><sep> Among the 18 students who enrolled for the course, 16 have taken the exams. <sep><sep> If I am late, in the morning, that is to say, if I am doing something against other workers, they will need to work more to cover for my delay. <sep><sep> Lawyers in the criminal field, as well as hospital doctors, also speak this "beautiful Creole" for the same reasons. <sep><sep> They don't know they need to learn English and French formally in school for 6 to 8 years before they can use it as a medium. <sep><sep> It can be in a lawsuit, as I said, or in a work sector or in a "general" field. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> WSF, in which they have put militant educational books, has become a bureaucratic organization that excels in organizing meetings only for debate, for research but not for political activist work. <sep><sep> In 1997 Le Monde Diplomatique published the draft on the Internet. <sep><sep> When we talk about alienation in the Marxist sense, when it is explained where it comes from, there is a bit, and there is an interesting mix in these different meanings. <sep><sep> We protested against the law, 2 laws that are very anti-worker and represent a threat to workers, but in 2008 these 2 laws were finally voted in. <sep><sep> The value of his actions has doubled in blood. <sep><sep> It exceeds what is released according to David Hume by 12.7%. <sep><sep> Through this campaign of the workers' association, a movement against imperialist warfare took shape. <sep><sep> It is not surprising that the sum does not match reality in which people live. <sep><sep> On the contrary, they are busily integrating the internal Mauritian economy into the capitalist economy, which produces more inequality, creates economic crises, and is responsible for ecological crises. <sep><sep> - What is making you sad? - The fact you entered my life. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They almost have no limbs, all limbs have been licensed, have received VRS, Blue Print. <sep><sep> There is no explanation other than it is like a punishment because it is on the outskirts of the village and it has refused money, compensation or any other attempts to make it leave. <sep><sep> He presented 2 evenings with Laurence, Sofi, Linda, and Medje, a book he personally prepared. <sep><sep> Note that MSM is very popular and Sanb Komers Sinwa is very popular, and he even invited to the Communist Party Congress in Lasinn. <sep><sep> The government should not take anyone from Mauritius for an imbecile, Seegobin said. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, in the office, there was a little talk about the importation of icebergs, in the rural villages retired women and men were trying their luck. <sep><sep> For 2011, LPT is launching a new "stedigrup" on the issue of Kreol grammar. <sep><sep> Will textile not be affected by the recession in Europe and China? <sep><sep> On the contrary, it was located in social union work in the 80s, and the political leadership role of Lalit de Klas, and compared it with the leadership and "social work" launched by the church in IDP, for back-footed politicization of young people outside MMM and Lalit de Klas (which will become LALIT). <sep><sep> We were also warned in our bed about the dance tactics that Mauritius is adopting to put all its weight on the contestation of Marine Park between the court Drwa Lamer and the British state. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Rajni Lallah has made several successful trips to Israel: <sep> <sep> And today, the USS McFaul is upgrading its Aegis Ballistic System. <sep> <sep> Among these reformist programs, there are some that are quite minimalist, they advocate for small reforms, and there are some maximalist ones, advocating for larger, more widespread, more important reforms, but they always end up with just the same old reforms. <sep> <sep> The CIA has even released software to a company where a single agent of the CIA can monitor "a dozen characters" each with their own fictional story. <sep> <sep> Among the poets whose work they read, there were Rowin Narraidoo, Umar Timol, Rajni Lallah, Emmanuel Richon, Henri Favory, Vijay Naraidoo, Lindsey Collen, Mohunparsad Bhurton, and Patrick Ramdhony. <sep> <sep> Agro-food industry - There is a new and dynamic bourgeoisie sector (such as Sarjua, Surat, Hassen Tahir) as well as Medine and other establishments, the companies in the Seafood Hub sector are also growing. <sep> <sep> For a woman to do business, she shouldn't have to be part of criminal law. <sep> <sep> LALIT's publication was a clandestine, underground one, underground in two senses. <sep> <sep> We express our solidarity with Atma Shanto and the Sentosa workers. <sep> <sep> It should be noted that in LALIT, we have often criticized this kind of licking boot attitude and label it as "the best loser!" - but there are certainly other groups that say that too. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Among the candidates in this 2 major alliances that have conducted the biggest municipal campaign in its political life, could have received municipal votes, like Baichoo could have received. <sep><sep> You can tell your friend "I voted for LALIT, me!" <sep><sep> Yesterday, Nilen Vencadasmy announced several times that the first action of the new group Collective Action Mauritius (the WANTED group has a new name) when he is in London, to see what happens in the Privy Council case. <sep><sep> Last September, we had WANTED 15,000 Youngsters with Jameel Peerally. <sep><sep> Finally, it is the case of Asha Rampadaruth where Bizlall went into a legal battle with former SBM battalion for an increase in his severance allowance from one million to 2.4 million rupees. <sep><sep> - There are deadlines: The UN Human Rights Committee has given until the end of February for the Government to explain its intentions; the Municipal Council is supposed to take charge this year. <sep><sep> It is a position that separates the issue of sovereignty from strengthening the Diego Garcia base and letting negotiations be opened up by the Mauritian government for economic interests. <sep><sep> Today, there are many people who work on contract, or work on a seasonal basis. <sep><sep> We find strategies like moving our political program forward, bringing it closer to the priorities of the working class and bringing it closer to the real power without the power of the elite. <sep><sep> The religious movements have made room for fundamentalist parties, which were politically organized, while the bays were flooded by a Quran "civil society". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian Creole language should be included in a policy that we can describe as: mother-tongue based multi-lingual education. <sep> <sep> Moreover, within the British Empire, and during the Second World War, where the anti-fascist resistance and revolutionary movements in Asia and Africa were gaining momentum. <sep> <sep> During the United Nations General Assembly speech, M. Abbas received an enthusiastic response from the majority of members. <sep> <sep> They will come knocking on our doors when they start selling off the land of Mauritius. <sep> <sep> It is clear today that with the financial crisis, global recession, and the complete breakdown of the capitalist system, there is chaos and unrest spreading worldwide, and it's now time to address it. <sep> <sep> The issue of "reunification of the Mauritian people" along with the issue of "closing down the military base on Diego Garcia" together. <sep> <sep> The trade unions SILU and UASI have been firmly established after the 1979 strike; establishment has prevented the establishment of its own shop; the establishment has been firmly in control recently. <sep> <sep> Especially in the education, family life, the situation at work, will all come back to the question of general elections. <sep> <sep> And everything they know that their uncle or brother has prevented them from doing, threatening, putting them in prison, making them commit crimes to participate in campaigns of any other party, or to abstain from the elections like 25% of voters did. <sep> <sep> The US imperialism is no longer what it used to be in the 1970s. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A nation that is dominated by another is a nation of slaves. <sep><sep> He stated that his work is consistent with the work of classical educators like Jean Piaget and Vygotsky, starting with what the child or individual already knows, and then moving on to the Lacanian ideas. <sep><sep> A month later, in a press conference, as reported in Le Mauricien on April 6th, Bizlall announced a training session “A collective of 13 trade unions at the initiative of Jack Bizlall”. <sep><sep> We, in Lalit, attribute this disaster that has befallen the MMM to the fact that it has changed its strategy, based on “class unity, not racial unity” to a new strategy based on “Mauritianism” and nationalism. <sep><sep> For this Sunday, 1 May, from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm, there will be speeches, messages from the Moris and international organizations, music-health, and poetry. <sep><sep> The political crisis stems largely from the economic crisis. <sep><sep> Have you already heard, when talking about “fundamental rights”, when found in the newspapers, in democratic countries, in France where the French are calling for a Commissioner for strikes? <sep><sep> What we want to do today is stop this process of centralization and mechanization that began in the 80s and has already destroyed many sugar plantations, it continues. <sep><sep> When you close down the Development Works Corporation (DWC) and encourage development workers to set up a private company and they can even buy pure equipment from DWC. <sep><sep> The amendments he is proposing seem simple (according to the newspaper LExpress): Keep 62 elected MPs at the constituency level, keep the 4 first prize Best Communal-Racial-Religious Losers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and also put en duty for the first time in the sovereign history of Mauritius on Chagos! <sep><sep> So, it's a time when the issue of a response, a challenge to the system, is on the agenda. <sep><sep> it will be able to conduct research at a high level, it will be able to make an academic contribution at a high level. <sep><sep> But, in the political struggle, we have to, our minds must learn to work like this. <sep><sep> We can understand that the Government is hesitating between "Les" and Air Mauritius heading directly towards Lasinn, and also looking towards "Lwes" when approaching Mauritius with France's Sarkozy. <sep><sep> But, we have to denounce union bureaucracies in proportion to the power we have to make their members understand the reasons why we are denouncing them. <sep><sep> 1. The Academy administration does a lot of work because there are a lot of skills gathered in a single structure <sep><sep> Their economy is bitter and almost entirely dependent on Israeli economy. <sep><sep> and it was much stronger politically than Lalit and MLF (who had famously organized the demonstration). <sep><sep> It was a Euro-Creole which had inherited a legacy on the Azure side - land, city, business in the hotel industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are also insulting people residing in Rodrigues and Agalega, who are also, citizens equal to us. <sep><sep> This means, they must acknowledge certain truths, they must expose the actions of the 2 bourgeois Alliances that are hiding, being responsible for the drug trafficking and follow-up crimes: <sep><sep> RSP Congress had taken place on 6-8 June 2009. <sep><sep> In our publication LALIT DE KLAS no 2, we have a statement that, meanwhile, the government is favoring the development of a state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> However, within our LALIT, we demand less repression, fewer police, and after the class society, no police. <sep><sep> There is the hunger strike of Jeff Lingaya, which is continuing after the 9th day "under perfusion" (meaning "with serom"). <sep><sep> Firstly, if we recall the purpose of the Lalit Film "For an Alternative Political Economy" made by Asher Woodward and Grace Goldfarb for us at the beginning of 2007, we will have an indication. <sep><sep> Already in March 2004, when problems within the Lalit youth group became evident, Ashok Subron systematically blocked all possibilities of a political resolution and he had opted for a confrontation strategy. <sep><sep> They believe that if they bury their heads in the sand, then their problems will disappear. <sep><sep> A house or even a child will be swept away right after the launching of a descent  in the air that makes Paloma drop even lower than a seasonal worker who loses all his dignity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They say we need to democratize the economy, but for them democratizing the economy just means that those who control the economy should share a little with those who have ambition to become capitalists. <sep> This means that workers have become even poorer, and all exporters, including establishments, have suffered. <sep> The book focuses on linguistic genocide in schools and on language diversity. <sep> Analysis of the economic crisis: its local and its international dimensions. <sep> There is also a connection between this lady and the women's movement. <sep> She has also put pressure for the Employment Rights Act and the Employment Relations Act to allow for better labor conditions. <sep> She explains that there are different types of "missions" being pursued: for literacy, for ecology, for education, for energy production, for social activities, and for health. <sep> Comrades Yannick and Kisna have said that there is a practice in Kiba resembling LALIT: in all activities in Kiba, there is food and drinks available. <sep> - Your grandfather, your father and your family were all Burbacks. <sep> For this, we need to reflect deeper, build our courage, and move forward. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation on the economy is so serious that the Existential Block History is under complete threat. <sep><sep> Working-class must mobilize independently from bourgeois parties (MMM, PT, PMXD, MSM, etc.) along with pro-working class allies. <sep><sep> A rock and debris blockade on the road to block vehicle circulation. <sep><sep> 'All of this power! Power!' - 'But the children believed it, they followed it, they put it on their flags,' the Prime Minister smirked. <sep><sep> When the police block the village, no one can leave their houses. <sep><sep> It all happened in 1983, after the MMM-PSM Government crisis, and after the simultaneous crisis in the MMM itself. <sep><sep> Call it a transitional program: it represents a transition from where we are today, to where we want to be, and it is in 3 parts: <sep><sep> Now Finance Minister Duval is announcing universities and private health as new sectors that the government is promoting. <sep><sep> Israel has blocked all access, its army is attacking as it wishes. <sep><sep> What is interesting is that all these confrontations are still going on today. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Due to Israel maintaining its blockade, the supply of food, medicine, cement, and materials for decontaminating water in Gaza remains prohibited. <sep>
<sep> Or do we need to prioritize a political solution? <sep>
<sep> At this level, most trade unions do not take action. <sep>
<sep> (It may seem harsh, but the process will shed light.) <sep>
<sep> Because every woman has the physiological capacity to have children, it is a woman's job that many women cannot avoid. <sep>
<sep> For example, there is a bodyguard, there are prisons, there are armed forces in place, for society to function. <sep>
<sep> A series of concrete blocks, a meter aligned on mortar to prevent the circulation of any vehicle. <sep>
<sep> The reasons given for their resignation are quite varied. <sep>
<sep> All this indicates that LALIT has positioned itself for a very interesting period starting in 2013. <sep>
<sep> Since Independence, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 families have been employed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, the explanations of the banking crisis given by journalists and university professors discredit the economic crisis. <sep>
<sep> This means there are two (or more) parties (or alliances) funded by the bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> Strong! The extremist movement plays into its hands, encourages it, and uses it subtly. <sep>
<sep> Besides, in the market, they had a good reputation; their merchandise was well appreciated because it was very fresh; and they did not put a hand in the customers' pockets. <sep>
<sep> If it is not possible for us to get out of here, we make a gathering, and in each gathering, we say "Let's go take power". <sep>
<sep> And there was a session on internationalism as a strategy. <sep>
<sep> The European Union has become an economic union before becoming a political union. <sep>
<sep> So every time a Worker is in power, everyone accuses him of "favoritism", when in fact the Worker is implementing a program on which he was elected. <sep>
<sep> His university thesis was on Epicurus, the first great materialist, and his first mission was to conduct research to legitimize the law that prevents peasants from "touching" the land estate in Lalmayn. <sep>
<sep> The PTr/PMSD government has faced a series of denunciations from the Opposition and the Press. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We sincerely hope that this new government's strength in the early stages and support for all its actions in the political battle will lead to the abolition of communalism in the legislature. <sep><sep> We have discussed other programs on specific timing. <sep><sep> Will we use "Nazi" methods to establish who the "descendant of slaves" is or not? <sep><sep> Another point of contention, we try to convince everyone here, it has been played, just as it is used to being played. <sep><sep> Then when someone said that his uncle's aunt said that the neighbor's cousin's cousin in the country of Toulsiwala has a lady friend who can perform miracles. <sep><sep> - Need for agricultural diversification and agro-industrial development on a large scale for increased food security. <sep><sep> LALIT often succeeds in providing an ideological framework for the working class. <sep><sep> Until it exterminated people who had participated in the revolution. <sep><sep> In other words, in politics, we have to find the "anti" thing and its goals at the same time. <sep><sep> We tell you what problems there are in the country, if necessary, we will use force, you will never pay. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we all take the Service to return The House and consider other possibilities. <sep><sep> Many parents were abandoning their deformed children on the surface of the burning coal train. <sep><sep> come to our MARXIST ECONOMICS session which will take place on Saturday 12 February, GRNW, 3.00 pm. <sep><sep> But the law wants to examine the true value of a worker who is working. <sep><sep> On this issue, assistance has the right to comment on a television scandal and abuse in Mauritius, in Medpoint, Neotown, as well as on MBC. <sep><sep> Action and method in the current context In LALIT, we find it politically useful to have a presence in the press, even if it is a bourgeois press with all the limitations that it entails. <sep><sep> The government must regain control over foreign exchange from the private sector to prevent rupee devaluation. <sep><sep> - Since the Report has become public, we have witnessed a "debate" and insults between Ivan Collendavelloo and Emmanuel Leung Shing. <sep><sep> If necessary, the government should give a prize (Rs 100,000 or more) to the best translation of each school text. <sep><sep> But if you make a little effort, your stubbornness can rise to the occasion.</sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is close with his father and children, he is close with his father and mother. <sep><sep> The police sometimes, in a moment of anger, make a girl over 18 years old marry a military man from her family, when she goes to live with a boy from another community. <sep><sep> We have discussed pressing questions and rights concerning the sea, we have studied IRS and the major development of the Medine establishment. <sep><sep> In short, this is a system where total voting will lead to the formation of a Government. <sep><sep> 7. Were there serious clashes between Navin Ramgoolam and La Sentinel, during a long period, at that time how was there a reconciliation? <sep><sep> We must not forget that a promise made by the MMM/MSM government in 2000 was to create 10,000 jobs per year. <sep><sep> * We are mobilizing people on the need for a strong military base and to unify Mauritius. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we consider it important to focus on stopping all police brutality. <sep><sep> It brings a new development that recognizes the ideology of institutional variety, its multiple ideological apparatuses, and elaborates on Marx and Engels' other perspective, which is an ideological approach to consciousness. <sep><sep> Why should the plantation be given access to derocking, Road Map Boolell said that it must sign a promise to plant nothing but bananas for 7 years? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means "economics" concerns size by the excellence "sociologists": one group (class) of people and another group (class) of people. <sep> Workers there are almost coming to know that workers from another country are in need of a class consciousness level, so in their generosity, they were sharing 200 bananas of experience with me in one day. <sep> Then we have a big element like BAI who's in insurance, then he's entered into importation of other things, then he entered into banking, he entered into health, clinics. <sep> He told about the similarities we are finding in the facts; one fact with the MMM/Ptr transaction talks and other facts that are still being played on whether Sita Nen will get a ticket. <sep> The political shape that this financially driven capital reign imposes, we call it "neo-liberalism". <sep> Then in 2007, the Workers pulled their plan Strategic Options for Foodcrop Livestock Sector. <sep> Rada Kistnasamy said that Lalit opposed the Best Loser system as communal, a retrograde system that classifies all parliamentarians, as well as the entire population of Mauritius, into communal categories. <sep> He was among the people who, since 1977, have created Lalit (later called Lalit de Klas), in which he became a guide for all of us, giving a sense of belonging, deeper emotional connection and a larger despair that he uniquely owned. <sep> And mother tongue, Creole and Bhojpuri, are often banned in our democratic system. <sep> On Saturday, September 4, the Lalit Youth Commission organized an "introductory workshop" on how to use comic strips in political struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Gokhool is stealing the amount since he emptied Mamb's savings account, it seems he is not aware. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, representatives of these organizations are waiting for other benefits from CT Power. <sep><sep> After 2 years, 19 out of 20 people get their IDs and cross to Israel's shores. <sep><sep> This double money crisis is clearly representing an abusive usage of this money, and making its use for a good cause even more difficult in the future. <sep><sep> Without food, without drink, medically, for a week, or even a moment. <sep><sep> In other words, it is a way of avoiding the kind of communism we have. <sep><sep> where the queen's interest lies solely with the bourgeoisie (on the other hand, it is in the interest of all the various capitalists to be in conflict with one another). <sep><sep> We can say that it is a part of the strength of today since the SAJ inheritance, one place, and since the existence of its Sun Trust. <sep><sep> The development that has been made in the press is whether the Mauritian economy is resilient enough, or whether it does not minimize against crises. <sep><sep> In parallel, there were a series of other more advanced but similar "Welfare State" forms. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The police even arrested people, trying to disperse the illegal demonstration. <sep><sep> In public, what is the reason that Ashok Subron has given for the resignation of those eleven members? <sep><sep> It is perspicacious, wildly funny, and combines his intellectual rigor with a disarming personal honesty. <sep><sep> And this year, on October 7, during its meeting, UNESCO will have a "thematic debate" dedicated to the protection of languages spoken in a country, and the protection of endangered languages. <sep><sep> In Rodrigues, it seems that the methods Alain Genave together with Ashok Subron have used are part of a set of union methods that we in Lalit find unacceptable. <sep><sep> Do you not believe how a young boy with physical courage, standing on a chair, is addressing an uncle with such insolence pointing a finger at the uncle's forehead? <sep><sep> So the governor and colonial bureaucracy here must have enough power to make decisions without having to always consult 'Saint' every time. <sep><sep> There are 2 very serious threats hanging over the working class: unemployment which is increasing every day, and prices that will have a cascade of increases because of the increase in global oil prices. <sep><sep> There is even a movement to abolish the foreign military base. <sep><sep> It is important for LALIT, because it's a strategic base for LALIT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Most measures currently proposed do not have any positive impact, neither in the short term, nor in the long term. <sep><sep> The importance of the union is the fact that it can represent the collective strength of all workers, whether in a company or in a profession. <sep><sep> Minister Boolell has denounced the initiative of the British government to make Chagos a "Marine Protected Area". <sep><sep> - Defining/constructing a good political party - with its internal democracy, its relationship with the avant-garde in the working class (which is relatively free from bourgeois ideology, because of its past struggles). <sep><sep> Baron Toupoumwa and his confidant, Captain Toutouk Touni, organized a spectacular lantern festival and a national week of prayer. <sep><sep> So, we find that different actors have different roles in different historical periods. <sep><sep> When examining historical trajectories, there are also the "historical blocks" that come into play. <sep><sep> In the 1990s, under pressure from the IMF, World Bank, and the WTO, with their neo-liberal economic policies, the government in Mauritius began to propose "privatization". <sep><sep> It may seem odd that on September 8, 2004, the Education for Workers Act was overturned. <sep><sep> But what is important is that this recent policy has contributed to getting more people to move towards these two blocks, even if they share their votes between them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They explained to us what has been happening between them since 6:00 pm yesterday (Explanation in Arabic script). <sep> <sep> We have seen a growing bourgeoisie elite, how has it developed? <sep> <sep> Expulsed from the nursery, passed through a period of curfew on the feudal system, the slavery system, the language system, and then the forced labor system regardless of quality. <sep> <sep> Step by step, they are preparing to start planting for the harvest season. <sep> <sep> This represents a major failure of capitalism, on a very large scale. <sep> <sep> If there was no South Africa, he would say the sector would have collapsed completely. <sep> <sep> For instance, all workers find price hikes as the main goal in the economic crisis that directly affects them. <sep> <sep> It is interesting to note a large demonstration on March 27, 1981. <sep> <sep> At the same time, it represented a composition with bureaucracy, which needed to be discussed with them, and at the same time, it united another group of union delegates from the public sector, private sector, and parastatal sector. <sep> <sep> Therefore, to return to Hares, it is necessary to make a detour back to the courtyard to pass through the checkpoint of Beit Iba. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government of the same country will increase the minimum wage of certain private sector workers. <sep><sep> And creating jobs, should we not mobilize to promote an alternative economy based on agricultural diversification, agro-industrial development, to guarantee food security and stable employment. <sep><sep> Vacoas Transport took advantage of an illegal strike, it closed its doors and did not have to pay any compensation. <sep><sep> We want the conference to become a unique opportunity to bring more coordination between all parties; to share experiences, strategies and the lessons we have learned in our daily struggle. <sep><sep> In the meeting of members on May 4th, no one questioned the decision of the central committee, especially no member of the Lalit youth group intervened on the suspension measure. <sep><sep> Once in a while, the streetlights go out; most of the time, the sky is completely dark. <sep><sep> This piece of land was well known for its variety of trees that were being sold illegally everywhere in the market of Bomatom Bharat. <sep><sep> It's a banned state, a lawless state that is acting with impunity because it is a protected state of China, and it receives special benefits from many European countries as well. <sep><sep> They were very attentive throughout his speech for a long time. <sep><sep> Many people are unemployed, living in insecurity between family conflicts to get by, working hard, and struggling with this, facing legal issues and other problems. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, if there are State Reforms and a reorganization of the Judiciary at the same time, there will be another kind of mobilization in favor of the Judiciary, where lawyers, especially civil society, will be involved. <sep><sep> ERA is defining these working conditions. <sep><sep> So, it is a beginning of an emancipation for our language. <sep><sep> Is it never enough? With tears and suffering, others live in misery. <sep><sep> Until finally, many people, when they talk about ecology, they are only talking about not using plastic bags or other penalties for individual behaviors that everyone should do. <sep><sep> The MMM had a well-respected class analysis, an almost sociological analysis rather than Marxist because it found evidence of a owning class in Mauritius. <sep><sep> So, when we ask you to VOTE LALIT, we are asking you to vote for Lalit candidates. <sep><sep> We have found a major mutation that comes only from the sugar industry. <sep><sep> There was severe repression in the Americas from the state, from armed men by employers, and also from the media. <sep><sep> And they work in different sections of Medine, on an immense surface. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A young person is facing a problem in finding a job, as there are more applicants than the time available for a mediocre salary. <sep><sep> The political class has focused on whether it has failed or not in its duty as a family caregiver on the issue of a listener. <sep><sep> This means that we are going to look at how the crisis affects the bourgeois political system, and how it affects the form that its State takes at a given moment. <sep><sep> A program of analysis (with a variety of disciplines - covering economics, ecology, production, history, sociology, politics) becomes a face-to-face confrontation, a series of transitional demands (taking us from today's reality towards socialism), and militant work to convince people to adhere to this program, especially convincing those with more experience, who are more reflective, who have already learned through their actions, and who are already implanted in the working class. <sep><sep> Since that day, Ram Seegobin has never made a statement. <sep><sep> Two young people from Tel Aviv explained to me how they usually pick olives in Israel for a peace project and they come to Palestine as volunteers. <sep><sep> For example, I am in the rosewood business, and I have been elected to represent my region in the central committee, not because I am a young person or not. <sep><sep> He stated that his strategy relies on "diplomatic action" and also there is a possibility for people to take the International Criminal Court (ICC) to court for crimes against humanity. <sep><sep> Also in this article, it is clear that others have followed him (whether they want to or not). <sep><sep> We need an economy that can create jobs, that can guarantee full employment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We do not believe that he is telling people which religion to become Mauritian. <sep><sep> So, this is a mandatory pretext to reduce government subsidies to the University of Mauritius, and the conversion of education into a commodity. <sep><sep> Labor Day this year, everyone went their separate ways. <sep><sep> But he had already abandoned socialist politics even before he took over the government for the first time in 1982 when MMM-PSM (PSM was the party of Harish Boodhoo that existed at the time) won the 60-0 election. <sep><sep> There is a renewal dimension that comes with this work. <sep><sep> Here, we had managed to raise the issue of strengthening the base in Diego Garcia through the Anti Lager World Movement. <sep><sep> And this also explains how there was a great jazz movement that developed in Madagascar. <sep><sep> Tunisia and Lebanon, after the overthrow of Ben Ali and Mubarak, have still not managed to establish a new constitution. <sep><sep> a situation that has lasted more than 40 years where every week Israeli bullets and bombs (supplied by America) are killing Palestinians. <sep><sep> Dear: Maybe it's worth our while to revisit this dossier that Comrade Yannick has shown in all of his speeches, to remind those who have fallen behind a bit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Basically, in such a scenario, it is perfectly normal to criticize capitalism because you are managing as a capitalist. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, PT, PMSD, MMM, MSM, they all used the sovereign question on Chagos and Diego Garcia as a bargaining tool with America and Britain. <sep><sep> - "Look at Ayoun trying to rebuild his cynical world," you can hear them say at the port. <sep><sep> When it rains, don't go hide in the store. <sep><sep> It's evident in these three waves: it's a base problem, a decolonization problem, and a problem of rights of return and reparations for the Chagossians. <sep><sep> (wounded by Israeli soldier's bullet and died in the hospital). Isn't the Israeli army nurturing Intifada? <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Air Mauritius continues to pay its pilot USD 104 when it's only USD 35 a day. <sep><sep> After all, there was a heated debate concerning Palestine and the role of the most powerful countries in this oil-rich region. <sep><sep> This conference is organized by War Resisters' International (WRI) and its partner organizations in Lend. <sep><sep> With one voice, they rightfully ask, "Hey, why should ordinary people bear the brunt of the big capitalist's speculation?" <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Around the world, especially near military bases, residents are protesting to close the bases. <sep><sep> - Even international diplomacy is turning to serve masters. <sep><sep> Here, we have a specific dialectical relationship between political parties such as MMM here, other parties in other countries, and what people think and do. <sep><sep> We are looking for this strictness - its branches (which are key), its commission, its assembly, its central committee, its documentation, its congress like today - as it looks for us. <sep><sep> In other words, events are proving that it is essential for progress that participants in history look at political reality in its entirety, as well as the contradictions between the different forces within it. <sep><sep> Ministers and MPs are enjoying hefty pensions, but for workers and poor people, the MSM-MMM government is causing trouble with the increasing number of pensioners. <sep><sep> Aubeeluck opened the forum in a room filled to capacity. <sep><sep> Is it normal for all association, unions, cooperatives, clubs to conduct their meetings in Creole but their contracts are forcibly signed with the Registrar in English or French? <sep><sep> In fact, what workers were doing was that they were uniting for peace and sharing together and distributing it equally for all workers. <sep><sep> We must ensure that we do not lose the battle for re-unification, because we are not building a real movement based on progress for all of humanity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The person was responding to a security guard who had said, "Why don't you like the police?" when Ram Seegobin said that security guards should respect private property where we hold private meetings. <sep><sep> But, Travis's favoring of "first past the post" had prevailed. <sep><sep> Pride, relentlessness, and mother's tears inflating her heart. <sep><sep> Lack of political orientation, in life. Some people don't work. <sep><sep> I listened to my friend Jane with great attention, but I also have another element to answer the questions she asked. <sep><sep> This means it is an institution with a pro-capitalist clear political agenda. <sep><sep> So, in response, there was another conference at the University of La Réunion on the theme "History and current affairs of the Diego Garcia military base" organized by Professor Georges Gauvin. <sep><sep> "The law gives me rights, I don't agree that anyone violates the law. <sep><sep> And, funny enough, even if we wear masks and dive under the sea, we won't understand big things anymore. <sep><sep> This Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS) that the Government presented to Europe for compensation for reducing disaster risk (European money, measurement accompaniment). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then at the end of last year we entered the countryside for village and municipal elections. <sep> <sep> Also, the issue of literacy in Creole, the mother tongue language, Creole and Bhojpuri languages, they are working-class languages. <sep> <sep> More than 50,000 workers and artisans in sugar and textile (part of the PWU-Jugdambi and AGWU as well as OUA-Rima. <sep> <sep> The Parish Priest had been entrusted with the responsibility of St. Antoine in the Afro-Creole region near Montagne Pous and the parish committee had decided to organize a festival to welcome him. <sep> <sep> So, the planters are challenging, and their interests, where politics intervenes. <sep> <sep> Demands have been made, so the Government here, like the USA, UK, Lalmayn, to spend money. <sep> <sep> This kind of demand also ensures food security in a period where food prices are starting to rise again. <sep> <sep> There are work permits for workers who already have a job. <sep> <sep> Anil Gayan had to resign and talk about "The Mauritian State" instead. <sep> <sep> His lumpen label, big lies, and arrogance prefer to go to Rama Valayden and his MR. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is how we can confront the crisis in an appropriate manner. <sep> <sep> For me, sketching out one or two fractures caused by the current capitalist system that blocks and will continue to block democracy and freedom until those fractures are fixed. <sep> <sep> It expressed a balance between what is sad and what is happy, between reality and ideal. <sep> <sep> They went to the Court of London because they are claiming their rights as British citizens. <sep> <sep> At the same time, he sold all his belongings to go live in a home. <sep> <sep> Then, he had to think about how he could prevent his wealth from exploding with government subsidies to agriculture. <sep> <sep> It is evident that the process of the Indian Ocean ZEE is a hindrance to the resistance of US military presence on Diego Garcia. <sep> <sep> And just when the Air Mauritius scandal is ending, the MCB-NPF scandal is starting to gain traction. <sep> <sep> Harold Walter and Maurice Paturau said when they appeared before the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on the circumstances surrounding the excision of the Chagos in 1982. <sep> <sep> Israel does all the dirty work that America can't do because the political cost would be too high if America did it themselves. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Currently in Birze, there are no measures to diversify production in agriculture and agro-industrial development on a large scale. <sep> <sep> Political activists have prepared the track (by understanding how a strike can unfold, where it is going). <sep> <sep> And you Wip whether you agree to vote in favor of a constitutional amendment allowing the use of the mother tongue in the National Assembly, if such a process is ever presented. <sep> <sep> The main difficulty in this new sector of work is the ability to organize - due to the long working hours. <sep> <sep> And this is what Paloma is not doing enough to ensure that she deserves Diego and is not good enough for her. <sep> <sep> People seem to have responded to the rhythmic Mauritian rhythm that A4 music represents. <sep> <sep> We have heard Kreepalloo and others when they are making a call to "the vision of our Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam" on TV. <sep> <sep> Because Pravind Jugnauth is making statements that contradict Annex B. <sep> <sep> But, despite this, there are some factors that hinder the development of our party. <sep> <sep> After half of the time, they will sit on roses, but elsewhere. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the Kotez experience and surrounding area in particular, along with Grand Baie-Bain Boeuf in general, had already laid the foundations for a special program. <sep><sep> Workers are going into workfare, there are workers on contract in construction sites, workers in SMEs (a fragile sector). <sep><sep> What we have found so far, from the revolution of 1789 in France, or even the rise to power of the MMM in 1982, is that we have subsequently been transformed into a "cash cow". <sep><sep> After that, he asked his family to bring him food in prison. <sep><sep> On 1st September in Grand Rivière, Kisna Kistnasamy and Yannick Jeanne reported their participation in the "Revolutionary Brigade" or the "Revolutionary Tour" 2 weeks in Venezuela and Cuba. <sep><sep> When constructing a building after laying its foundations, as long as you look and continue to build scaffolding, you can continue to climb higher. <sep><sep> When legalizing abortion, it is said that the law will tell you what you are allowed to do, and what you cannot do against the law. <sep><sep> We're not going to overlook all these points, but we need to keep them in mind. <sep><sep> The MMM, one of its priorities since the Militant Students Circle. <sep><sep> We are pioneering this fight to bring home at a price that everyone can afford and to regularize the conditions of all inhabitants of state land. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it's a time, a thing that unites Mauritius, the opposition, the government, the Mauritian public. <sep><sep> One after the other, they have a hard discourse in the United Nations, and at the same time they are looking for commercial benefits for the patron of Mauritius against the threat of that hard line. <sep><sep> They were taxing them, e.g. those who were good with the rain, or even those from LaSuede to Langleter across the Indian and French lands, all were taxed by the Vatican State. <sep><sep> But, social science, I have studied social science, it has been flattened before the dominant bourgeois ideology. <sep><sep> Then, American companies started to invest in the UK, it began after the 2nd World War, and they began to take control over English companies. <sep><sep> Systemic crisis to overturn the balance of class forces - the forces that each capitalist class section, each working class section, and the different types of alliances between different classes have. <sep><sep> It can nurture us, and we can sell it. <sep><sep> After a good moment, it managed to control its panic. <sep><sep> Finance Minister Jugnauth will soon present his first budget (Friday, 19 November). <sep><sep> Thus, the government is actually hindered by the hundred young people waiting to get into the labor market. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, in sectors like the Sugar Industry, where there were 12 premises, the boss made all workers take 6 premises from the beginning of the year. <sep> Here, the police saw them, saw LALIT and when they detained lawyer Sheila Keetaruth, they accused the bosses of violence and harassment against their lawyer. <sep> Meaning that people become aware of how all mobilization forms part of a single unity through the creation of a "program". <sep> In all matters, one also needed discipline, knowledge, and observation. <sep> If there is a social crisis on a national level in Mauritius, it is not good for the tourism sector as a whole. <sep> And it is a good system, a good law, a good Constitution". <sep> Meaning, either the worker does no extra work or does no less work than they are supposed to, they need to stick to the designated hours and finish at the designated times, stop working when there is a break, and resume work when the break is over; <sep> When the working class regains its strength, then parties like LALIT will become stronger. <sep> And in this kind of period is when the term "historic block" is used. <sep> By 1937, he had organized a trial against 53 leaders of the Bolshevik Party, most of whom were in the Opposition of the Government, and finally 19 of those 53 were officially accused of treason. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means repression for an insider regarding a protest against George W Bush in 2002 is still burning in front of the courthouse in 2005. <sep><sep> But I am becoming a burden for everyone. <sep><sep> Today, when evidence has shown that the mother tongue enables cognitive and academic development in children, some people continue to persist, insisting otherwise. <sep><sep> When there was the AGOA forum, we organized protests, gatherings here, and it was a kind of regionalism. <sep><sep> There is a need to mobilize for a new process of society, an alternative economic policy. <sep><sep> SIT should take action in the sugar industry in all zones, 20%. <sep><sep> Water problem: When there is too much, there is flooding, when there is none, there is drought. Like Mauritius, Rodrigues also suffered significant damage to agriculture after heavy rain. <sep><sep> Second example: Once again, looking to strengthen its position -- its personal position -- in GWF's perspective, the CAWU union is clearly not enough, despite the manipulation that we have just mentioned. <sep><sep> Faced with the proposal to reduce the price of rice by 39%, which the current Government is proposing? <sep><sep> In history, other social classes that have made revolutions, like the bourgeoisie, had already "taken economic power" and its ideology was already dominant when it finally took political power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And so, in a sense, alone, far away. <sep><sep> Meaning they do not accept this logic that ethanol, bagasse, and all that can help increase revenue. <sep><sep> They know that they did not object by force. <sep><sep> They did not have the right to talk about "capitalist class" (should say "elite," even if it means the same thing). <sep><sep> On 13 October the FPU (and its other "international" federations, if we can call them that) held a demonstration. <sep><sep> "Our second poem is 'Christmas every year' by Shyam Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> It is a bit, as Rajni Lallah says, a celebration of frivolity: a celebration that begins without warning and where there is no need to wear nice clothes to go out. <sep><sep> Participation in the demonstration in front of Parliament organized by CTSP (2009). <sep><sep> Without a military base, it is difficult for America and its European allies to maintain their strategic power. <sep><sep> Answer: You know in Lalit there are no less important or more important posts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we are not used to Jean Mee Desveaux, but in his very controversial interview, he said ONE thing that Ram Seegobin said that he believes is worth citing, among many other things that are not worth citing. <sep><sep> And in that same Alliance, as we are accustomed to with the Labor Party, his speech will be well finalized, surely on Friday night. <sep><sep> Rogers has just made Rs. 20 million available for 4 years to NGOs for HIV-Aids awareness campaigns. <sep><sep> This just shows the sentiment that existed at the time. <sep><sep> Conflict between the working class and the capitalist class, it also, it shakes the political landscape, much more than a cyclone. <sep><sep> He could influence Shakeel Mohamed's position, even Yousouf Mohamed. <sep><sep> Important acquisition attempts like example, but they will not bring socialism. <sep><sep> Education and Language Commission (which has had a great victory with Creole entering schools in 2012), Web Commission (perhaps a commission that will meet more), and an international commission. <sep><sep> This closely resembles what happened with the Privatization Fund where there was a separation from the budget where the front organisation Telecom entered several separate funds, out of democratic control of the National Assembly. <sep><sep> After that, he went on to put forward something called the Political Committee FPU, which became FMP, which has joined together with OMT to become PMT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this Press Conference, Berenger went further. 
<sep>Family should seek refuge in the gynecology section, and her case must fall under 4-5 conditions: either the family is pregnant and at risk of serious physical or mental health problems if she does not undergo an abortion. 
<sep> We are in a position to intervene to promote our program, a revolutionary socialist program, a transitional program (we will explain this concept better later, if you wish). 
<sep> Legislation, women's liberation, Palestine, Creole language, land (in the scandal signs of Neotown), food security, military aggression in Lalibi, Diego Garcia, Independence. 
<sep> We must convince you that, in addition to fighting in your union, there is a political struggle that must be brought about - otherwise, you will not have all the basic rights. 
<sep> And financing from the State of Israel, and other countries that support it like the USA. 
<sep> We have started using our health and music to support the movement. 
<sep> In many constituencies, there is a great doctor between the first and third in a team (between 3 constituencies). 
<sep> When Finlay Salesse, a journalist very respected by Radio One, mixed a personal opinion about the issue of sodomy with the opinion of the station (influenced by religion), he stopped. 
<sep> An ambiguity is that the law specifies that the woman must be 'quick with child', a medical term that corresponds to when the first baby movement is manifested, so it cannot be done. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When there is no space for dialogue for good conduct, prison becomes uncontrollable. <sep><sep> But most people in Jericho preferred to worship themselves with their own made-up stories for a comfortable life. <sep><sep> Now families are getting in touch with organizations in Jerusalem and Ramallah to continue legal action and prepare responses for the court. <sep><sep> Since the 70s and 80s, LALIT has been supporting initial actions to advance the struggle for the liberation of Chagos and Diego. <sep><sep> The book "Ti Bato Papye" is selling for Rs 50 a copy. <sep><sep> In 1976, it was easy to compare, as elections found MMM on one side, PT on another, and PMSD on yet another. <sep><sep> This section says it can be included in the proportional system a section to say that the party that wins the most seats after "counting" guarantees a majority after proportional representation. <sep><sep> Even though everyone knows that The Chinese State is taking care of the Military Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> This is a sign that this 'systemic crisis' that LALIT is warning about and that is coming is becoming increasingly difficult to hide. <sep><sep> Everyone would be equal before the law; no one would dare to disrespect the law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If more than 11 people are in front of Parliament, he will tell you 11 have rights, you come at 12, but I need you. <sep><sep> These other laws, unlike the law that says, according to the American Constitution, "All Men are equal", did not specify any "except the blacks". Yesterday, the American Civil War, one of their big guns, one Abraham Lincoln, is to stop slavery in the south. <sep><sep> An awakening has occurred among the "age chauvinists", to make them realize that their words are discriminatory between young and old people alike. <sep><sep> The "5 values" that can easily be accepted by the same parties of rights. <sep><sep> You are proposing them a strategy called "mauritianism," a strategy of confusion. <sep><sep> LALIT will reach the Great River North West on May 1, as a family, to continue this political preparation. <sep><sep> The working class in general will debate enough on a common program, to have enough authority on a conscious program. <sep><sep> And, it takes all kinds, this struggle. <sep><sep> Yesterday was right, because Bérenger was not even elected. <sep><sep> Regional democracy doesn't just mean voting every 5 years, and then waiting for the council to do what's necessary. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The political leaders that Lalit praises are those who create dynamics and explain how we have many new members and many young people. <sep><sep> We, the people of Mauritius together with the African and American people and the English people, are making a strong base, there's no doubt. <sep><sep> There is a company in the tourism industry, New Mauritius Hotels, which this year has declared more than 2 billion rupees in profit. <sep><sep> The main reason is clear: In school, children are taught in a language that children do not speak everyday at home, in the streets, in their environment. <sep><sep> There has been much reflection among all new members on what would interest other young people in politics, especially in areas related to branches. <sep><sep> It seems that in this era, this style of action is gaining ground, where there is a fusion of individual grievances and where they are creating mobilization around them. <sep><sep> and Practical Work through educational games, poetry, health, reading tables like Picasso. <sep><sep> It is serious that unionists do not seem to realize the significance of this proposal. <sep><sep> So, when we look at how these people who might have been somewhat good at some point, and the Council has indicated where they have ended up. <sep><sep> There is evidence that this proposal could be realized in full neo-liberal maturity, it seemed impossible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Just like a mirror that knows how to reflect, a mirror 788 kilometers longer than Israel has been started to be built in the occupied territory in 2004. <sep><sep> Since the general election, we have been preparing for our campaign to start the mobilization campaign of resistance. <sep><sep> with a healthcare system, education and universal pension, social security, governmental laws, and a system where the state provides the people with water, electricity, telephone. <sep><sep> This kind of democratic control will create in administration a public service based on a private company where the National Assembly has no control. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen continued to say "We do not know whether the press realized the enormity of this annihilation, the enormity of this curve. <sep><sep> With his own Tim's hands, Tim removed the weeds, pulled out the bad earth, planted them and on the forehead of his signified brittleness, there were large bunches that his son had given him. <sep><sep> The hawk was choosing where to drop its tears. <sep><sep> We must remember that, where LALIT, our program comes from our party. <sep><sep> Comrade Anand: Lalit is a class that brings peace to all classes, that brings equality. <sep><sep> Since that time the relationship was no longer the same. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The crisis and this poverty will dog our predictions in the next 2 years. <sep><sep> When MMM took over, it was just after a racial struggle around Independence. <sep><sep> This means that the Government is transferring children from their own group to another group through language and cultural policies because children's education is taking place in dominant and foreign languages, English and French. <sep><sep> L'Express 27 Zin 1990 announced that "Diego and the Chagos not on the UN agenda." <sep><sep> Otherwise WSF, it, it doesn't even register us! We should have registered like members of other non-political associations, or not gone there at all. <sep><sep> This means that in 3 years, when renewing this collective framework in the Security Industry, unions will have to negotiate company by company. <sep><sep> We have certainly discussed collectively not only "What we need to do", but also "What we shouldn't do?" <sep><sep> While it is a transitional program, its central element will question the system, a system that is causing problems that affect people in their real lives today. <sep><sep> Dance styles have evolved from styles reminiscent of the 1920s "flappers" to "boogey-woogey", "jive" to Michael Jackson, even "salsa" and Shakira's style for the World Cup in South Africa; music styles that have become more popular (including the roots of jazz): Ella Fitzgerald, the unique Ray Charles, several numbers by Janis Joplin and Tina Turner, which lean more towards rock. <sep><sep> So they take their leave, all their capital, and they go to produce textiles in Madagascar because it's more profitable there, so they make more profit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes Paul Bérenger claims he doesn't know that. <sep><sep> But on paper, we must understand him, and we must continue to work to develop a better understanding. <sep><sep> Another problem, a longstanding problem in all countries, but it's resurfacing here. <sep><sep> Decentralization would also make literacy work easier. <sep><sep> On a second level, Ashok Subron said that Lalit will denounce the MSM-MMM electoral agreement, which we consider regressive and dangerous. <sep><sep> He said we have to expose this kind of fraud. <sep><sep> That is how we will convince the Government, how we will convince the Opposition how we will convince the Chagossian organizations that if we do not guard this articulation, we will not get far. <sep><sep> Why did it, a simple woman, become so important? <sep><sep> Then I will look at the situation in Mauritius through space, that is to say the reality regarding freedom and democracy in various workplace contexts, for different categories of workers. <sep><sep> They are moving around in the yard, they will have a video camera to film the demolition. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, it is clear that the bourgeois and radio presenters, they are part of the Bourgeois State, and they, in defending the capitalist system, even if they have to betray the truth, democracy, freedom, justice. <sep><sep> A week later, November 25th, there was a vigil and concert at Plaza organized by the Telecommunication Workers Union in collaboration with the new Confederation of Trade Unions of Gos-Solidarity with the slogan "Renaissance". <sep><sep> Even with money, their first record donations came from small donations from poor people and workers. <sep><sep> A second funding problem is the activities of Ashok Subron in the IT sector. <sep><sep> [Auguste Follet indicated that for UASI there was Pillay, and for OUA Rima it was not an important issue.] At that time for Lepor, there was Aurelie Perrine and for Transport, there was Jimmy Gobin. <sep><sep> Amid social and economic crises, the Government plans to close its five departments to reduce its revenue. <sep><sep> These are meaningless figures, dating back to 40 years. <sep><sep> Social crises and destructive trends in society are worsening. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister in response to a Parliamentary question stated "the return of the Chagos to Mauritius will not affect the American military presence on Diego Garcia". <sep><sep> And our expo-launch is coming at a time when the Middle East is in turmoil with a visit from President Bush in the Middle East. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Ramgoolam government is not showing any political will to encourage the development of new sectors that will make the economy less vulnerable to external crises. <sep><sep> So, the coalition is holding us back in this regard. <sep><sep> Responding Lindsey, on the importance of doing as Mandel encourages us, that is to say, going beyond the way we used to think. <sep><sep> The Education for Workers celebration was a celebration at the same time as the global Creole Language Day in 2011. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, we have mobilized international opinion, academics, political class, civil society to say that the decision by the British Government to establish a Marine Protected Area is like a "Trojan horse". <sep><sep> Together we have had the idea to organize a peaceful demonstration, silent. <sep><sep> One after the other, they organized a lunchtime demonstration on the street in a night between only 2 candidates. <sep><sep> But we're also facing enemies with new labor laws and new philosophies behind these labor laws, the very nature of unions is starting to change. <sep><sep> For more than 10 years, the Jugnauth government has been signing the Marrakesh Agreement that these events would occur. <sep><sep> But in the meantime, there are already workers who are doing the same work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, this has brought a cashier in the transmission of knowledge, experience, and understanding, on how to build a more democratic, more participatory political party. <sep><sep> but it has a limitation because it needs to negotiate the price at which the worker sells his labor courage. <sep><sep> Alafen Kamomi felt 'Salam' and they all slowly fell into the trap. <sep><sep> In their foolishness, the Full Bench obliged all candidates in the General Election to declare at least one of the 4 localities in the Constitution when submitting their Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> A call from Hazi indicates that he did not manage to cross the checkpoint to go to Hebron. <sep><sep> And this in turn provokes a social crisis; domestic violence, theft, family disputes, further violence, riots, murder. <sep><sep> Some of our members, like Kisna, have spoken out against the American base in protests in Japan. <sep><sep> There, it is a situation where it almost becomes an insurrection. <sep><sep> So, during the election campaign, we experienced a rather bizarre situation, where L'Express and Le Mauricien, for example, were forced to put their headlines on the fact that the economy is in total crisis. <sep><sep> and also because of his comments against Eric Guibbeau in Beau Bassin, which led him to leave the PMSD. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This joke makes political beds, abandons economic beds, and replaces them with the search for a "social goal", which became the emblematic during the World Summit for Social Development (1995) in Copenhagen. <sep><sep> That is why we say your contribution to encouraging the democratic debate process is nil. <sep><sep> Position of the Government and bourgeoisie on Chagos by Alain AH-Vee. <sep><sep> and for every activist to develop his ability to intervene with confidence and legitimacy, with calm and serenity, develop his ability to understand the situation. <sep><sep> This will help in the capacity of children to understand the world, through the capacity of language at a higher level. <sep><sep> Maybe we should give, but it's waiting for this land and St. <sep><sep> You all expose workers to a superficial, inaccessible, cut-off world from its own reality of housing and neighborhoods, its own language, its own life. <sep><sep> *Convert industrial infrastructure to preserve and transform food products, if the factory wants to benefit from the money. <sep><sep> And it is in this story, not only the way you gain power, but you gain power through the mobilization of the working class. <sep><sep> Where possible, we call for all training institutions to gather in their country to send a joint delegation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Trickery of the Government concerning this election demonstrates a lack of respect for the voters in constituency number 3 and for democracy in general. <sep><sep> So, the first point of this communication is to appeal to all political leaders, starting with Rama Valayden. <sep><sep> Within the MMM, there is no doubt that Hurnam is creating a landmines: the support Hurnam is receiving from Voice of Hindu is turning an issue that might have serious electoral implications in the upcoming partial elections. <sep><sep> We have put our 2002 paper on our website with a title that says "Wise before the event". <sep><sep> The death of ASP Raddhoa is not just a new sad event for his family, it's not just a death that has happened before an individual has been publicly shown to be able to change. <sep><sep> Then there was a great excitement around female candidates. <sep><sep> a national monetary system and also a written and formal system for trade and capital investment at an international level. <sep><sep> She had a job at Misie Ibrahim's shop. <sep><sep> This whole place had become like a sinister region, without the lively animations and activities that usually characterize this important location in Port Louis. <sep><sep> 2005: Candidate position against the Social Alliance and the MMM-MSM Alliance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (a) It is essential that all food items have a label indicating that they are GMO-FREE. <sep><sep> This includes facilities like Laventure Business Park, benefits in tendering processes, permission for swift deliveries, government advertisements in the press, all of which are considered as a form of "facilitative capitalist government." <sep><sep> There is an article that raises the question, "What is the strategy of the bourgeois State?" <sep><sep> It becomes an ideological concept that is enshrined in the Constitution. <sep><sep> Secondly, at our time, it is more political: people in North Africa and the Middle East continue to be uplifted politically. <sep><sep> The Introduction of Creole and Bhojpuri in schools represents a significant advancement in the struggle for decolonization of our education system and the liberation of oppressed classes. <sep><sep> This is reflected in the recent protest in Rose-Hill organized by the Private Sector Union Confederation following partial elections and their transparent demands. <sep><sep> It falls on leaders like Ram Seegobin in a primary role as part of the "civil society", without providing any space for Lalit in the field of political democracy, where the political power can be challenged. <sep><sep> This depends on the existence, for example, the Lalit party's involvement in different issues. <sep><sep> Lalit had received significant funding for its election as President of America. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, the fact that we were in AKM has allowed a certain freedom for those against the mother tongue, and for those who see language as a terrain for identity struggle. <sep><sep> In 2006, Lalit launched its Education Program. <sep><sep> It even goes on to say that it is 95% certain that it is not Dr. Surnam who did this translation - which he used here! <sep><sep> Others might consider giving a tip - albeit their choice is to scratch. <sep><sep> Health is becoming a business, not a service, and even less a right. <sep><sep> It was born after the fall of the MMM-PSM government and the fall within the MMM. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy, who chaired the LALIT Press Conference on Saturday 2 February on the electoral reform theme. <sep><sep> There are certain families who even know how to raise their own line of poultry, pigs, goats, rabbits. <sep><sep> With the new Pelindaba Treaty, an African Union Treaty for a Zone where there is No Nuclear Weapons, is just becoming a joke, Diego Garcia is becoming a nuclear issue. <sep><sep> You get people like Beejadhur who are becoming very influential through the press. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So people are led to believe that the struggle is challenging the best loser. <sep> and on ideological repression - 3 things that come with the defeat of capitalist ideology. <sep> and the promotion of the maternal language, in village councils, in neighborhood work, in the fight against police violence, against military bases and those who volunteered in the occupied territories of Palestine. <sep> and when we talk, we can shed tears in our eyes. <sep> There is a paper on the campaign for an Economic Policy that we developed during the last elections, another paper on Economy and Ecology. <sep> Because they have a letter, and technically when you have a letter, in law, British citizens are "subjects" of the Queen. <sep> - Lalit says the Best Loser system must be completely eliminated. <sep> Cross your fingers (Mr. Prosper used to say 'bring them water') for the ceremony. <sep> and where dust is becoming thicker and society is becoming clear. <sep> The Historical Working Class no longer appears bright during the current systemic crisis, even if Ramgoolam is spinning his wheels with trade unionist speeches in the sugar sector, some planters and establishments are with him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, when they became more powerful, they started facing difficulties. <sep><sep> We must avoid development that damages water resources (such as golf courses). <sep><sep> But then there were protests in CNT, which adapted as a protest to preserve the coastline because the government was starting to introduce other private companies where CNT had exclusivity. <sep><sep> And it is normal that this new law will oppress some people, upsetting others, especially those who benefit, or believe they benefit, from the status quo. <sep><sep> The English version will circulate, and if the members of this sub-committee are pleased with the story, it will be translated into 15 languages along with 20 other stories from other languages. <sep><sep> It had a special license that allowed it to discover what was invisible to others. <sep><sep> It’s something that starts continuously, almost constantly, and it is resistant because of the “block” that it built, it remained solid. <sep><sep> But they always follow a sacred law: there are only 2 ways. <sep><sep> But what political force can form a resistance to the capitalist system when it ravages the environment? <sep><sep> Findings concluded that current language policies are causing confusion among children in schools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Understanding the economy, understanding economic reality and how it triggers and influences a punishment system where politics comes into play. <sep><sep> Contradictions arise, where last year saw Dev Virahsawmy getting involved in identity affairs, which Xavier Duval criticized him for as he mentioned the negative side of poor people's lives, which was seen in a communal interpretation. <sep><sep> Another issue that marked this was the fact there is an election looming ahead between the two major blocks. <sep><sep> - Why is the Government encouraging capitalism in the tourist industry by monopolizing all the beautiful beaches and shores? <sep><sep> You go to negotiate, the employer is supported from here, the trade union is supported from the other side, a table is somewhere there. <sep><sep> I don't have a complete answer, but I ask myself if the people, workers, working class, are not demobilized because in the class struggle process we aim to reach a classless society. <sep><sep> What is most important is good coordination between the state, NGOs, and society to address the problem without forgetting a multisectoral approach. <sep><sep> In short, we wrote to the Prime Minister to present a demand to introduce the Kreol language in the National Assembly in February. <sep><sep> The IMF then stated that all countries must balance their trade deficit, otherwise their economy would collapse. <sep><sep> Trends are moving towards abandoning the plantation system over the next 4-5 years. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If it doesn't get any petrol, it will be canceled. The Israeli government is currently in a hurry to ensure that a land of ruins in the Middle East is respected by the Middle Eastern people, preventing it from becoming part of the Zionist State. <sep><sep> Thus, working-class + political parties like LALIT + those with experience in the flower industry can express themselves in their work. <sep><sep> When her husband decided to enlarge their house, he built his own corner - a living room, an office, an adjoining bathroom-drainage room - and Jamouna became a single-mother-servant. <sep><sep> LALIT is a voice that is being raised worldwide against the policies of the WTO that are making poor people even poorer and rich people even richer. <sep><sep> It's not just Jack, not just Subron, not just us, all sitting together at a table. <sep><sep> Another force that has started to emerge - the pro-French-speaking lobby. <sep><sep> LALIT made the decision to support the struggle in Gaza since the last invasion, and to continue working on the issue of Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> They see it as a time when there wasn't enough to eat, where there wasn't even "cassava-sweet potato-maize" available. <sep><sep> Instead of union leaders calling for the mobilization of the working class to shift the economy from sugar cane, and to force the government to use European money to restrict the economy and create jobs and ensure food and currency security, what can we expect from them? <sep><sep> Services to be drafted in Creole and in a good format for law texts and advertisements for various sectors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So he has recommended a series of measures to the State that can reduce and limit the production deficit, as well as encourage agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> They performed so well that their skills were recognized on a national and international level, allowing Baron and Captain to become national heroes. <sep><sep> We encounter different interests in different circumstances, different moments, with people who have different relationships with us. <sep><sep> A group of 3-4 individuals in a union, together with a member as an individual, they have brought the struggle to fruition. <sep><sep> The struggle involves international movements to ensure that workers have freedom of movement. <sep><sep> 2 pillars of GWF are struggling, as a barrier is imposing restrictions on them. <sep><sep> Clearly, it cannot implement the same policies as its predecessor because the era of import substitution has ended. <sep><sep> There has been a sudden Arab Spring, demonstrations and strikes in Europe, movements of Indians in Spain, Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, student protests in Canada. <sep><sep> After the tears were shed, they did not stop anyone. <sep><sep> Instead, they are channeling their energy towards developing an economic policy that will allow the population to meet the economic and social crises that are seriously threatening us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, Lalit Conference denounced the Marine Park which borders a nuclear power plant. <sep><sep> Along with another LALIT Bambous member for example, they campaigned in a completely new way in Ward No. 14: they brought a small truck with the LALIT program, more emphasis on solidarity and a plastic bottle with glue hidden inside, all together with an empty sack. <sep><sep> Then, in 5 years, in 4 years, the Sitanen will say to you "Oh dear, the measures I have taken, have led to economic growth of 4.5%, 5%, 6%". <sep><sep> With the different plans of the government and the bourgeoisie to make the capitalist system supplant, we find that the trade union movement is being demobilized, weakened and fragmented. <sep><sep> Most government officials swear by the government and encourage their followers to plant their carrots. <sep><sep> When the amendments of these 2 laws are announced, then the GWF/JNP quickly organize a "demonstration" and after their arrest program, declare that they have won a "victory". <sep><sep> This entrepreneurial strategy that the Government is continuing, rather leads people towards poverty. <sep><sep> Instead of developing large hotels, they should develop the countryside with big boats. <sep><sep> When Timi regains his knowledge, he would first look for his children and teenagers. <sep><sep> There is a worker who knows he has become part of the capitalist system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Corruption in government is bringing about licentiousness and immunity, a production crisis where products are not able to be sold. <sep> Workers, students, youth, and families come together to defend these rights, to demand more democratic rights and freedoms, to propose true sanctions. <sep> Unity is not just a bunch of leaders sitting at the same table. <sep> Areas where there is more debate and conflict in public are financial sectors. <sep> What is happening after you have ousted Gaddafi. <sep> How can we articulate the class struggle in a more pragmatic way, for those who do not understand the class struggle? <sep> He also knew that his repressive drug campaign was supposed to be against drugs: There was a police team Morvan-Mestry, who had started on the Rault Commission. <sep> Second challenge we have is from 1935 where it is the PTr strength. <sep> * Multiplication of small businesses (SMEs), through all kinds of methods, including through the Empowerment Program. <sep> Not because it has destroyed the regional democratic system in the countryside. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Back then, luck always favored him politically, because Samazest Toupoumwa was always on good terms with people from many countries. <sep> <sep> Now, we start to get corrupt, where we still believe we can find a party in it, or some unity in it, better than the other two, when we find out they're all corrupt. <sep> <sep> Continuing on, fundamentalist religious colonies often come from colonial supremacist colonies terrorizing rural residents physically. <sep> <sep> We can see from these examples, how unique our Mauritian language is. <sep> <sep> PMSD, on the other hand, left the government when the Prime Minister started to act against the "private sector" sections that PMSD defended, a historical bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> This brings us to the second goal in the third paragraph where workers are concerned: <sep> <sep> We said we should keep village and village council elections, and conversely, establish councils for each ward in the city where people can address their Councilor after the elections. <sep> <sep> If we look at union bureaucracy, there is an extraordinary degree of opportunism. <sep> <sep> Since they leave their position in the class struggle, they understand society in different ways. <sep> <sep> This means that there is a class, to have a class struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The key mantra on the economy is "turn towards the East", but we have not made great progress apart from the announcements, such as the large investment projects in Singapore for mega-projects. <sep><sep> We will also present our program, which is a program that is quite unique in the context of this election and not just a traditional program. <sep><sep> If ever in this moment, the working class was strong enough, politically as well as in its class consciousness, it would have been a moment to take power. <sep><sep> LPT was born in the wake of the student protest movement of May 1975 where college girls were in the forefront. <sep><sep> We find ourselves in the obligation to address this letter, in your capacity as Prime Minister and President of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Disability Extraction. <sep><sep> Here, we are still talking about class struggle in relation to people's experiences. <sep><sep> The Government has declared certain areas where supposedly civilians are for security but there have been several armed attacks there. <sep><sep> Rosemay is under obligation to fire a shot through the lake to finish the challenge. <sep><sep> Families are sitting on the cliff edge drinking whiskey, we are taking care of this, eating alfalfa (a special grass and sesame seeds) and drinking date-coffee. <sep><sep> (People laugh.) What the Sithanen is doing, when agricultural land prices become a price that multiplies by 10 or 15 times like residential land. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the days of Martin King, there was kindness, a sweetness that enveloped him. <sep><sep> But before the convoy started, a servant came to tell him that a lady wanted to talk to him privately. <sep><sep> What we have done, the truth only slowly emerged, after slowly going to different meetings to analyze the situation. <sep><sep> It may seem flexible, but in reality, there are many women and children working in conditions of slavery in family businesses. <sep><sep> He proposed that there should be an "All Party" Commission (government and opposition parliament) on the issue of Chagos. <sep><sep> Obviously, when you propose your program, it is different at different times. <sep><sep> It is true that Jean-Claude had clear ideas and beliefs about what he believed was necessary to improve quality of life and bring about comprehensive development at the same time. <sep><sep> Today, Rajni Lallah said, Berenger is not talking about believing in the strike, he is not talking about Constitutional amendments. <sep><sep> The conflict between the government and the MSPA has become public after the conditions were set to strengthen the St.Felix, Mon Lwazir, Ris-an-O mills. <sep><sep> But, it is only when everyone puts their heads together, when everyone understands the crisis and its complexity, understands the nature of the crisis, that we can develop a program together, develop an alternative together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It has been a long time since Sir Ralph noticed something. <sep> <sep> These past 2 weeks have shown us all the signs of feverishness in politics in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> He said that MMM agrees with the demand to amend the Constitution of Mauritius to assist "Creoles and other Christians". <sep> <sep> In every era of history, there have been different ways to lead something towards success for us to live. <sep> <sep> This concept of beach security has changed a lot from this new law. <sep> <sep> And in a third wave, it has executed all its colleagues around him who organized this "prize" series. <sep> <sep> So, on our website, we write an article highlighting LALIT, where we congratulate the organizers, where we denounce the presence of a small communal group with T-shirts, and where we deplore Jack Bizlall's counterproductive speech. <sep> <sep> We found out last year that Minister Boolell, who had already allocated more to the Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS) which favors establishments, has been completely removed from the MAAS negotiation session. <sep> <sep> Meaning that the bourgeoisie stabilizes more than it has risen to power, even if it is a minority class. <sep> <sep> Its greatest dream, as an MLF member, was that decriminalization of abortion would become a reality. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>It hurts people to go read on our site (2) why Ashok Subron has quit LALIT. It was because we did not agree with his way of working as a unionist. <sep><sep> Or contribute to putting 2 class groups of workers in conflict. <sep><sep> PTr and SSR have colluded and incarnated this interest in the past; within the PTr there were some courses of law that were ideologically very close and PMSD. <sep><sep> In 2008, once again there was a Ramgoolam-Duval-Mohamed-Boolell Government. <sep><sep> We advocate a program where workers are at the forefront. <sep><sep> A construction worker talked about how there are health and safety issues, and when you protest you risk losing your job. <sep><sep> If it is not addressed, it could lead to a major problem in the relationship. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin concluded that on this issue, the Collendavelloo Report addresses a real problem with a strong solution. <sep><sep> LALIT says we need, for example, to implement a system where every college graduate can go straight to university. <sep><sep> One of the measures suggested was to introduce a system where College Form VI graduates can go straight to university. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The pro-capitalist politics is symbolized by Sithanen and his demagogic anti-big capital politics is symbolized by deputies like Nita Deerpalsing. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen also reminded us that long ago, Royal College used to produce global champions in chess, bridge, and other sports in books. <sep><sep> It is important to remember that it was the Berenger-Jugnauth government who allowed this to happen when they generously gave 40% of Telecom to the France Telecom, and before them, it was the Labour government who privatized Mauritius Telecom. <sep><sep> Bolema Holding decided to recruit him to implement a gender management policy everywhere. <sep><sep> It is clear that the security industry, for example, is facing difficulties where operators in this sector have even said that the defense industry, it is not viable. <sep><sep> Our 4 families have set a mirage goal of getting out of the trap that is supposed to open up for the farmers to go to their plantations. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, this Report has not been included in the war kit in the Ministry as is customary: all those who participated in the consultations received a copy. <sep><sep> And, a new thing, before Fet there was a "argument workshop" hosted by Ram Seegobin. <sep><sep> When this was exposed to everyone, in 1982, everyone, and a group of people, went to vote to get the Labour Party out. <sep><sep> You know when we decided to have this Conference, we knew that the Diego and Chagos issues were becoming a concern. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> Albie Sachs himself, and his Commission had to speak out against the communal bestluzer system. <sep> What is clear is that he did not delve into democracy as a whole. <sep> He played sports, he went to school in Mauritius, and when he looked for work, what did he do? <sep> Then, Boodhoo and his nephew were burned alive in a cruel act of crime. <sep> Are social conditions largely responsible for the fact that in some eras there is so much "drugs" and "violence" in some eras less? <sep> So, when it comes to the sermon, there has been a surge of very serious contradictions between all their versions. <sep> Together with us, he said, “A death too sad, because of a very unfair law.” <sep> The freedom of speech was putting pressure on governments to liberalize commerce and privatize sectors that the state was controlling. <sep> In 2004, when there were elections in Afghanistan, warlords started aligning themselves as candidates in the election. <sep> When he felt the peak of anger, he began to calm down a bit and started making plans for repentance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Berenger takes over the economic and political leadership of the PTr-PMSD and heads to the IMF to gain further support from the same financial institutions controlled by imperialist America. <sep><sep> The enslavement system works to serve a purpose to expose what it is: a modern form of enslavement. <sep><sep> These two laws, for example, make licensing easier, it helps create an atmosphere that diminishes democracy and freedom. <sep><sep> A special quality lies within the fact that there are youths in all our structures. <sep><sep> They are forced to face potentially difficult regional election bids. <sep><sep> Implemented through institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, WTO, and also through the imperialist US military force and NATO. <sep><sep> Because you know in Mauritius people sometimes say, "Ah, it’s impossible!" <sep><sep> Corruption and conspiracies are present in Mauritius, but they do not help us understand anything. <sep><sep> The masses have been mobilized in a context where the trade union movement is weakened and lacking in cohesion. <sep><sep> Support for this Bill was being built, but the sanctions were not entirely visible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, we were in this meeting at LITRA, at the time. <sep><sep> Sometimes, in the afternoon, they even go as far as coordinating their efforts. <sep><sep> When the decision was made in the Central Committee, it was a unanimous decision. <sep><sep> Among them, 25,000 acres, division, for big establishments, but big establishments when they pull the land in canes, always have a project, IRS, ERS, cement, industry, hotel, etc. <sep><sep> We will participate in the Zurne on the 20th of March 2004 against exploitation and occupation. <sep><sep> One of them, James Lovelock, wrote a popular book called "The Revenge of Gaia", which means 'Mother Earth's Vengeance'. <sep><sep> The MMM has sought to form its own “historic bloc” made up of multi-class canes and districts, based on an anti-establishment ideology. <sep><sep> However, I have a lot of affection for it; a lot of affection, a lot of gratitude for the light it has always given me. <sep><sep> So, there is a constant ideological struggle among the other classes in this “historic bloc”, even though the “historic bloc” itself is against bourgeois actions. <sep><sep> While organizing everyone into his harem, Stalin had organized it so that the people literally adored him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But they are using it (another abusive term) to launch their new crackdown plan. <sep><sep> For some time now, all the people have been very alert where these 2 Alliances are receiving funding for their campaigns: dirty money from big businessmen, property owners of hotels-lodges, and even from certain blacklisted companies. <sep><sep> You might hear a poor guy saying, "Even if that's the case, be careful! My husband can sweep me away!" She leaves, she goes away. <sep><sep> For this job there is an entire pedagogical team, and LPT has even appointed a Guided Professor for 156 days. <sep><sep> The olive planters on this field have replanted olive trees 12 times. <sep><sep> In a dark and eerie case the investigation had begun. <sep><sep> But he kept silent on the big pensions that ministers and deputies benefit from when they no longer sit in parliament. <sep><sep> So there was a proposal from the European Union for a reduction of 39%, starting from 2007 to 2009. <sep><sep> But, as the system of slavery became unstable, its internal contradictions emerged and slavery became illegal in Mauritius and in other places. <sep><sep> When PT-PMSD was completely discredited, the bourgeoisie needed other types of political representation so MMM had to soften. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The first person to take concrete action against the "best loser" system. <sep> In 1976, when the MMM took power, it proposed another slogan, its motto: "One nation, one people". <sep> Trade unions had been formed and had gained strength, and some of them had transformed into a political party, becoming the Labour Party. <sep> The first important point is that we have managed to put the "economy" issue on the agenda as it had never been before. <sep> This economic background led to, 10 years after independence, a greater vulnerability and economic and trade challenges for the young state. <sep> When looking out to sea beyond the island, looking towards Montagne Pouce, there was Albion on the left and Azure on the right. <sep> In the past, and even now, there is a current called the "anarcho-syndicalist" current, which, although claiming to be a political party, does not really need a full program. <sep> The findings of the International Hearing on the LPT are a strong argument for the cause. <sep> If there is a deaf ear here on earth, it is just a commodity. <sep> Lalit calls on all citizens to raise their voices against the dictatorial drift in which Paul Berenger is leading our country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, when there is no "good behavior", it is normal for a prisoner to become eligible for parole if there is a remission of sentence. <sep> In other words, we convert services such as health, education, and law into rights. <sep> Or is it just since we started to notice it (subjectively)? <sep> Since 1959, Cuba has placed a claim on Guantanamo on the United Nations agenda every year, renewing its demand to return Guantanamo. <sep> In the Global Warming Forum, people continue to call here to ask where Ashok is. <sep> Soldiers are only just landing in the houses, breaking, tearing and shooting at random inside the houses. <sep> There are 3 important things in the Balancy crisis, one concern Best Loser, 2 concerning other points: <sep> Several United Nations Human Rights Committees have criticized the Mauritius Government. <sep> MBC is broadcasting the Workers' Rebellion as a propaganda boat. <sep> The bigger the social force, the more likely they are to have good toilet paper. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This meeting was chaired by the Minister of Defense of the Zini government, Chris Bridges and his Public Relations Officer, Victoria de Lornay. <sep><sep> Playgroup has given this 6-year-old boy the opportunity to introduce Creole language in this school year, for the first time in history. <sep><sep> iii Food crisis: We have collaborated with a series of other organizations and have established a FOOD SECURITY FRONT. <sep><sep> According to classic (and completely relevant) Marxist analyses, the state arises in its most recent form from the "State". <sep><sep> The latest washing machine statistics show that domestic chores are affecting more and more families. <sep><sep> When you read this Bender's speech, we must bear in mind his central point. <sep><sep> where their practices, and occasionally they defend the same causes as the union. <sep><sep> One of the many events that occur when every year all members have general assemblies, there is a very strong union that gets a Voice in its Members Assembly. <sep><sep> because the capitalists who were exploiting workers in the Third World treated them the same as workers in Russia, their leader made alliances with the Soviet Union under the "Forward Camp" framework. <sep><sep> Before the general elections, during the electoral campaign, and after the elections, they have been silent on economic issues, more specifically on the key issue "What should be produced? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, in his newspaper, he defended the government's position on this issue. <sep><sep> There is an audio extract that some sectors are already using as a basis for discussions on this issue within the framework of the LALIT. <sep><sep> People who Timi was meeting were not just a colleague, a smile, a pout, hope, despair, a lighthouse, a moment that caught the sun, a special thing, an individual. <sep><sep> Timinn did not talk long on the phone because he knew it was very painful for his grandmother who was quite deaf and who hated talking on the phone. <sep><sep> He advanced and began to appear like a newspaper. <sep><sep> Let's look at the general way the police were behaving in their work. <sep><sep> The public was complaining, businessmen who were paying taxes and who had beautiful brothers to run their businesses were asking the authorities to act but in vain. <sep><sep> Another responsible person, Carol Benson, has already made a claim for Education for Workers. <sep><sep> Then come with the analysis sheets, sheets that will help us understand the processes behind all this series of "social realities" that Rada mentioned : scandals, favoritism, size becoming reality, melting, etc.<sep><sep> And as LALIT has been fighting for a long time for our mother tongue, we will also mobilize people to demand the introduction of the mother tongue in schools. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to rebuild our party, recruit new members, strengthen our branches, and centralize operations. <sep><sep> At the same time, Mauritius offers itself as a country to host meetings involving the African Union Heads of State with the AGOA (The African Growth and Opportunities Act) officials. <sep><sep> International media has exposed its weaknesses in this situation. <sep><sep> A new wave of militarism in which we find Diego Garcia active in bombings. <sep><sep> We will show the film "Stealing a Nation" by John Pilger. <sep><sep> This, it is possible, will become the beginning of a new phase. <sep><sep> The leader of GRC and the Chagosians Social Committee have focused solely on reparation and the right to return for the Chagosians. <sep><sep> Wherever we are, there is a dimension of WA in our neighborhood, in our village. <sep><sep> History has its own rhythm, with SIDS coinciding with Tsunamis and its devastating effects. <sep><sep> All branch members must be ready to step up, ready to defend party programs and strategies in the rural areas, no matter where they are. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite pressure on him to accept the position of regional administration minister after his election as a deputy, Tim refused so he could complete his work. <sep><sep> The working class and its political movement, represented by the Workers' Party, began with a political strategy aimed at weakening the capitalist class in the 1930s and 1940s. <sep><sep> Politicians liked to say: 'Never say never in politics.' Tim's first encounter with politics was entirely negative. <sep><sep> Palestinian resistance magazines have been present in democratic revolutions in Arab countries. <sep><sep> The criterion "distance from home to school" (instead of just region) disadvantaged people living in the countryside, as schools were located in the city with easy access to facilities (shops, libraries, British Council, galleries, etc.). <sep><sep> Following this letter, the Minister of Women's Rights has requested a meeting with the MLF. <sep><sep> So, when young women go to work in the French language zone, whether in BPOs, for the first time they encounter conflict with a representative of the employers. <sep><sep> "Excuse us if we hesitated to join your latest initiative," Ram Seegobin concluded. <sep><sep> When the natural light thawed them with its two long golden ribbons from alongside, protected by the breeze, they knew they had found their own Promised Land. <sep><sep> Big zeroes made zero, we couldn't care less about the double points. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, a lot of light outside, they also light up the classrooms. <sep><sep> Then on Sunday the 12th of November, we have a big meeting at Plas di Ké. <sep><sep> We never understood why Rodrigues only has 2 deputies. <sep><sep> I have learned that the Prime Minister gave a speech, on the 3rd of November, and then he gave me courage. <sep><sep> This means that in order to fight for a good environment, we need to regain control at the same time of our own land (our working courage) and on the economy that is destroying our land outside of us. <sep><sep> while at the same time it perpetuates an economic policy that keeps the economy of Mauritius a subordinate role in the global capitalist system, that is to say in the production of luxury products for the West: <sep><sep> Tove Skutnabb-Kangas and Professor Robert Phillipson submitted their nominations for the International Linguapax Prize. <sep><sep> In Bilan LALIT Assembly, on Sunday 19th of December, Alain Ah-Vee presented an action report LALIT during 2004, in front of the members meeting. <sep><sep> They stayed on the other side of the colony until 3:30 p.m. when we had to leave the car. <sep><sep> Or someone says something in a car park, the government sends the CCID to arrest him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Coming up to 1982, as far back as the Travayis opuvwar, the same mechanism for the development of a capitalist bourgeoisie was being established.<sep><sep>The police still have a police officer to call and defense lawyer, Jean Claude Bibi, was summoned to obtain Mr.<sep><sep> Constitutional amendments by the MSM/MMM government contain many elements for serious constitutional and political crises in the future.<sep><sep>This capitalist bourgeoisie is a dependent one, but it depends on control of the state apparatus.<sep><sep>We have worked to produce proposals, but what we maintain until today is, in the absence of a very general mobilization, the electoral reform.<sep><sep>However, GWF was a federation with a very rare history.<sep><sep>and allowing Chagossians to return to Chagos as Mauritians and in full dignity.<sep><sep>When I went to the oath of office, I was a little cut off from politics, but this spirit puts everything into question.<sep><sep>Not like the "awakening of Sleeping Beauty", but we need to find ways to awaken it.<sep><sep>Is it only this issue that plan Obeegado has allowed the Church to remove its "Star Colleges" with which they do not agree? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I have never witnessed anyone to whom children had so much affection, and this immediately created a bond when they met him. <sep><sep> The response found in what we call "pre-political work" in LALIT. <sep><sep> And this will be done through a political program and a trade union program together. <sep><sep> An animated debate would follow to clarify certain points and to deepen the analysis. <sep><sep> There is a series of licenses and a number of people without jobs are increasing day by day. <sep><sep> They have uprooted an entire people with an incredible cruelty, dragging them into their abyss so that they can gain "baseless power" for their benefit. <sep><sep> It was mentioned that this morning, Lalit sent a letter to the Prime Minister and a copy of the letter to the President, calling on them and demanding. <sep><sep> 10 Kamini's pregnancies were nearing their term. <sep><sep> Comrade Eddy, for example, in his speech found lalit as his only concern something about people who don't work, who are in dire situations, who have lost their homes, only those people who are part of the lalit party. <sep><sep> We, too, do not agree, and in terms of the law, for women. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, JNP has a new meaning that no one seems to understand too much. <sep><sep> Bizlall publicly stated that he does not agree with Subron on this strategy. <sep><sep> There's already this gleam in the research that the State is indeed doing. <sep><sep> The conflict between employer representatives (in the Mauritius Sugar Producers' Association) and the Government is worsening. <sep><sep> Because the strike is tougher, employers tend to react violently and not negotiate properly. <sep><sep> Capital, the State, and Labor then when this sector is devastated like this – 60,000 workers become 5,000. <sep><sep> The villages around Hamlet, Lermitaz, and Kotez were grouped together to form a mini-municipality called Grangob-Bonnvenn, and in this area, Timi was very popular. <sep><sep> Before this, during the toiling war, there was what was called "primitive communism"; this was also a logical point: because there was nothing stored, there were no different social classes. <sep><sep> Today, when there is such a crisis, imperialist countries, when there is an economic crisis threatening to give up. <sep><sep> Vidya Golam also highlights that the characters of the novel are not 'great heirs', 'great names' but workers who are fighting for human dignity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it is based on our program, we ask what challenges we can overcome. <sep> But, the best loser system was applied, and it went smoothly. <sep> Obama speaks of the rights of Israel to defend themselves but he doesn't speak at all about the rights of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the more extreme threats they face every day in the occupied territories, in Gaza by the Israeli army. <sep> Later, comrade Vijay had raised the concept, with reason, of the "boss of progress." <sep> All the representatives of the people were rewarded for their spirit of sacrifice. <sep> But, they were active. When MMM returned to the opposition, after 1983, it systematically excluded LALIT union workers. <sep> Today they planted an Rs600 million DBM debt, which I don't believe they will be able to repay. <sep> After they listened to around fifty witnesses they unanimously recognized the need to use the mother tongue in education. <sep> And if you never accept it, you will face serious consequences. <sep> on the other hand, it calls for more than a reform in the decisions made on the use of land and other resources. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And we are emphasizing the importance of collective work, with a common understanding as the basis of our actions. <sep> This figure represents a peaceful situation in general in Mauritius and this is what makes it very difficult for a family to rent a house, or even to apply at the NHDC for a housing unit. <sep> The crisis has been exacerbated by the mismanagement of funds and payments since the Europe plan that was supposed to be used by the Mauritian government to restrict the entire economy to absorb the shock announced in this crisis. <sep> MSM has left a mark with Rey A. Jugnauth in the 90s, especially between 1983 and 1995. <sep> Ann Veneman, Secretary of Agriculture: She was seated on the board of Calgene Inc., the first company to introduce genetically modified tomatoes into the American market. <sep> In work classes, there are some people who are really poor, as we all know. <sep> Section 49 has stated: "The official language of Parliament is English and Mauritian Kreol, but any member can speak in French or Bhojpuri". <sep> For this reason, we ask everyone to keep their phones silent so as not to create disturbance during the session. <sep> We are pleased to present a speech that Ram Seegobin made at the LALIT Conference on Diego Garcia and Chagos, 30th October 2010, verbatim. <sep> Complications sometimes arise when the number of candidates on the list exceeds the maximum number of candidates that a machine can register. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People are losing trust in the system in the absence of physical evidence on the way they voted. <sep><sep> However, these two institutions are giving diametrically opposed instructions on the crucial question of whether or not an individual can be disqualified as a candidate for General Elections if he/she does not declare a "community" on his/her Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> Tomorrow we will explode Alain Ah-Vee's speech on the strength and weakness of the worker class organizations. <sep><sep> Lalit's Demand to the Ministry of Culture and Government after Cancun: <sep><sep> So, when we found bureaucratic confusion, we preferred to withdraw our number, and the AWC was broken by the blow. <sep><sep> Some were replaced with police in uniform and batons. <sep><sep> Political form imposed by capital-financed reign, we call it neoliberalism. <sep><sep> Besides, a severe crackdown on riots, it is not a reason for a licensed director to fire anyone! <sep><sep> A big fat zero is always a zero, therefore we appreciate my departure. <sep><sep> This creates many problems for going to work, it causes problems in difficult fields and it is impossible to use forgiveness. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like Doudou Diene, former Director of UNESCO and Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, often says, racial classification persistence and perpetuation is a more serious issue than what colonialism has left behind. <sep><sep> He could have a great voice, but he had a very shy nature and used to stop speaking just a few moments before it's too late. <sep><sep> * Develop the fishing industry, especially after the United Nations approved a surface of 2.3 million square kilometers in the exclusive economic zone of Mauritius in 2011. <sep><sep> So, it is said that a man has gone fishing during the epidemic. <sep><sep> The strength lies in the constant presence of all the organizations that largely explain the fact that we still have rights such as free education. <sep><sep> This act on the website stated our position on the threats present in this sector, and weakened union movements from holding those real threats accountable. <sep><sep> Firstly, there must be a contract, which is currently still being written. <sep><sep> A lady was feeding the chickens in her yard. <sep><sep> There is a question of sharing discontent, with 24-76 percent of disputes between workers and planters that the MAB is addressing. <sep><sep> They are revitalizing resources, when necessary; they can have a greater or smaller proportion of workers on the farm, or in the associated industry; research also, binds them together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Speech by Lindsey Collen on the occasion when LPT observed after 3-4 years that the degree of the harm that it does to Moris children when the school punishes their mother tongue, because our mother tongue is our way of thinking.<sep> <sep> We also need to understand as well as possible, and to establish a bridge to a socialized society that we are targeting. <sep> <sep> This is what will determine how to plant, how to organize the plantation. <sep> <sep> Auntie mothers will find her costume, sewn with invisible fabric, very beautiful, everything. <sep> <sep> However, it can bring us backwards and even more serious, it can bring us to a communal conflict. <sep> <sep> We have managed to explain the differences between Lalit and the pre-election groups, differences between Lalit and communalist, fundamentalist groups <sep> <sep> Factors often do not know bad people who are very miserable, because they do not receive light. <sep> <sep> Where the swing is less, it often ends in the evening, either 2-1 in favor of MMM-MSM, or 2-1 in favor of the Social Alliance. <sep> <sep> People who are ready in the village, not to say you, have really shown their peak. <sep> <sep> so that the money can go to the Medine delegates to the Parliament of Delegates at Port Louis, the Parliament of Delegates at SILU-UASI National. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Confirmed now: the price of sugar has dropped by 39%. <sep><sep> It is time to take a stand against the occupation of Diego, the occupation of Iraq, and the occupation of Palestine. <sep><sep> But what the expression "to do different" describes is an incident that is not related to national politics, nor does it have any influence on the signal that is the social history of a country, either a region, or the world, to handle. <sep><sep> Any government that has come to power has repressed the mother tongue means the Creole-Mauritian language and the Bhojpuri-Mauritian language. <sep><sep> Afterwards, we learned that there is also the possibility that Ashok Subron is granted the right to vote on the name of that union in Rodrigues in the GWF. <sep><sep> (Now employers also know how to organize demonstrations against signals, other than people like Malenn Oodiah. <sep><sep> * Pravind Jugnauth is accused of a process of commercialization of heritage with the minister, in particular the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden and 4 public beaches. <sep><sep> and the Government and the Opposition, because for 3/4, there is no longer a clear signal to follow, there is no room for what, in French, is called 'false fleeing'. <sep><sep> One possibility is to follow a step-by-step storytelling style, starting to finish. <sep><sep> Since 2008, there have been many controversies over this power plant and at the same time there have been protests against the effects of CT Power, which has obtained its EIA certificate to start. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - During the LALIT conference in Novam, we received 33 messages of support from several organizations in different countries, including England and America.

- He even made Chagossians sign a document that could compromise them.

- Crazy and passionate love in the TV series "Paloma", it is neither crazy nor passionate but rather an imposed dependence.

- People from other countries often go abroad to study how to handle boats.

- Meanwhile, the Republicans are trying to improve conditions to increase the ceiling:

- For the MSM not to change the law on political party financing, it is a strong action because of the return of Sun Trust. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is called 'Master' and his wife also has no name. <sep><sep> When you read it, you will understand the nature of Ramgoolam-fish regime! <sep><sep> In his theory, he specifies 2 types of alienation: between man and nature (metabolic rift, alienation from the bowels of nature) and between man and his own labor power (alienation from what he produces). <sep><sep> The year 1990 represents a turning point in the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean and the return of Chagos. <sep><sep> He looked at his family with much love, with much pride, with gratitude that there was a place for him in this great heart. <sep><sep> And we call on the government of Mauritius to immediately sever its diplomatic ties with Israel. <sep><sep> But, at the same time, the Commission tends to become a Workers' Party tactic where electoral, rather than serious work, prevails. <sep><sep> The media functions as a flashlight controlled solely by MMM. <sep><sep> This crisis, in turn, has repercussions at the union level where PLHDWU does not agree with the nomination of external administrators. <sep><sep> There is a distance of 10 km between Ramallah and Jerusalem, but he takes a Palestinian an hour and a half and he has to pass through at least 5 checkpoints. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Neither the central government nor the previous administrations were able to address the issue in this sector. <sep><sep> It is an institution that organizes, at least, a few rare events, only on Saturdays starting at 1:00 pm. <sep><sep> Keshore Pertab, a member of the MMM central committee, has specified that he is speaking in his personal capacity. <sep><sep> We agree and analyse that most political parties are controlled by these two types of lobbyists. <sep><sep> When Prof. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas is here, all professors and academics claim to agree with her. <sep><sep> 2011 was a very different year from the others. <sep><sep> The strike of the workers of Lasinn Tangs Knits in Koromandel started last Friday, after the employer announced that there would be no overtime. <sep><sep> Sometimes the interests between different classes are so contradictory that there is no way to reconcile these divergent interests in one party. <sep><sep> People do not realize that they are risking the intellectual alienation of all children. <sep><sep> However, unfortunately, in reality of the educational field, this leads to what I was saying at the beginning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There should be "cross-fertilization, so that all our crops and other plants are contaminated. <sep><sep> Indeed, there is diversity in terms of resistance forms, whether to take resist seed or more difficult seeds to grow, whether there is time and can be difficult to take seeds. <sep><sep> The question arises, whether it is not rather sad that society has a constant role in shaping each individual (ourselves, our siblings, our peers), to a certain extent? <sep><sep> A certain Minister Mohamed discovered that there is a linguist in CNT where this management which is responsible for the problem in CNT is taking advantage of PRB, while drivers, controllers, and mechanics are surviving with a minimum wage imposed by NRB. <sep><sep> It is also an opportunity to pay tribute to all the militants who have contributed to the "Class Struggle" and LALIT - both present here in the room - who through their commitment, have made it possible for us to have this inheritance to share today." <sep><sep> Their presence has made our race even more dynamic. <sep><sep> It is not often that we have deep reflections and rid ourselves of inaccuracies regarding the issue of the Creole language and particularly without participating in sterile debates. <sep><sep> The government has also announced that it will use Morisyan Creole in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> However, they do not realize that today there are only 5,000 workers in the sugar industry. <sep><sep> Now it is making people believe that we are, former, our forces that have prostituted the cultural heritage of Endo-Creole; that we only look at our own interests and our families; that we are not doing anything to make the Endo-Creoles have a greater economic power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They prefer to eat breakfast with their coffee even if they know that the sugar industry is a risk all the way. <sep> <sep> Q: Comrade Patrick: In terms of Independence Day, we should, I believe, become politically independent, economically and territorially. <sep> <sep> There was a group of young people who were at the Youth Club in the courtyard. <sep> <sep> and all that is leading to a food crisis, which is one of the serious crises that the planet is facing today. <sep> <sep> Where workers from all over the world will have to stand solid, strong, organize, prepare and help to face this crisis within the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> In other words, we are not saying, “Yes, what is needed is more family planning!” Will this lead us to have 12 Mrs. Bappoo in the Cabinet of Ministers? <sep> <sep> People transfer those capacities that they were supposed to sweeten to a single god or to different gods. <sep> <sep> He said that there are so many contradictions on fundamental points that these three witnesses have zero credibility. <sep> <sep> There are some great errors of Mauritius who do not know themselves outside their own villages. <sep> <sep> We have to study society, organize into a group. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As for the report, there was a raffle for T-shirts and caps from Venezuela and Cuba. <sep><sep> The meeting took place on Saturday, the 21st of June, 2008 in the Council Hall, Municipality of Port Louis. <sep><sep> On another note, the country is at a standstill, and public funding is necessary to prevent bankruptcy and the risk of banks going bankrupt, especially German and French banks. <sep><sep> There are some issues regarding cohabitation due to the very small population (estimated at 350 people). <sep><sep> It all began with the "Muslim League" before the partition (Pakistan becoming a separate state with Lenn) in 1948. <sep><sep> However, it becomes more difficult to build support when one does not clearly understand the true motives behind Mauritius' actions and the direction it is heading. <sep><sep> One part cannot be stronger than the class it represents. <sep><sep> The current agricultural production system is controlled by "profiteers" who own the land. <sep><sep> And it becomes even clearer when we find Lemer Moignac, Berenger's man, shaking hands with him in front of the press." <sep><sep> Everyone is asking: 'Will we still exist tomorrow morning?'. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a lecture on "Political Education" in the general card of LALIT on 29 July 2010, Ram Seegobin presented an analysis of the historical trajectory of the LALIT party. <sep><sep> He said "I am not a capitalist, I have no establishment, I do not own a bank, I am with the people like you." <sep><sep> MMMSP, which was a grouping slightly more worker-oriented than the MMM when it split from the MMM in 1973, but eventually, it only reached in 1977, it came with its program "Democratic and Popular Mauritianism (MDP)", and it became nationalist. <sep><sep> For example, together with the Terms of Reference of the Sachs Commission, there was a "brief" from MMM, which was a party in the alliance of MSM-MMM. <sep><sep> And this seemed to bourgeois, its finality was to gain political power, and it succeeded around the late 150s or early 200s. <sep><sep> To succeed in consolidating the base in Diego, we need to raise our voice in this fearless movement and mobilization against the militaristic bases that are developing. <sep><sep> The lamp in the construction sector has slowed down because there are more projects. <sep><sep> A guardian said no to a member of the group, then insisted on bringing them to the office, by force. <sep><sep> But surely, transport workers need to reflect on the necessity of contributing to the creation of a political platform that can propose a socialist alternative to the capitalist economic policies advocated by PT, PMSD, MMM, and MSM, a socialist alternative that is responsible for the entire working-class problems. <sep><sep> In that meeting and later in several cabinet meetings, the Minister of Defense in late 1965 had discussions on the detachment of Chagos and the installation of a military base on Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have recognized that this recommendation is indeed taking shape. <sep> <sep> There are 20 spokespeople for about 350-400 families in a block of flats. <sep> <sep> But there are other bacteria that cause much more serious intestinal diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid, which can sometimes be fatal, but fortunately are not present here in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> It seems that this is due to bureaucratic red tape that characterizes the island. <sep> <sep> For example, if the mother tongue is Bhojpuri, then Bhojpuri should be used. <sep> <sep> Q: Can you explain in more detail the shortcomings of the ALL WORKERS’ CONFERENCE as a means of unifying workers? <sep> <sep> The Gaza Freedom March is a testimony to solidarity with the people of Gaza in their struggle against the blockade, and also to show the world that they will continue to live in Gaza despite the blockade imposed by Israel. <sep> <sep> The book is based on a speech given by Dr. Tove Skutnabb-Kangas last year at the Port Louis Theatre as part of the Knowledge for All campaign. <sep> <sep> During a period between 1982 and 2005, it was the MSM that ensured the development of this bourgeois state. <sep> <sep> When Former President Cassam Uteem described him, I said here, "But, yes, it's normal like that, it must be like that, all the elements together". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Power and wealth need to be redistributed from the capitalist class to the working class. <sep><sep> This is what Ram (Seegobin) was saying before me, that when there is a crisis, it is us who have to bear the burden, our crisis, our system, it is us who have to carry the burden. <sep><sep> This deprivation that the children of Sibury suffer greatly hinders the children from learning English and French well. <sep><sep> On the other hand, "Not me, WTO and globalization this". <sep><sep> He says that Lalit has a lot of responsibility for the way this government, especially the way Paul Berenger, has acted. <sep><sep> In this Resolution, he clearly states that all measures that Israel takes for "similar physical, compositional, institutional characteristics". <sep><sep> And it is necessary that, when we protest, we make ourselves ridiculous by entering into a committee organized by a National Campaign dictated by Paul Bérenger and Pravind Jugnauth, when these 2 conmen themselves introduced bribes for fake exams SC and HSC, against which we are protesting. <sep><sep> Everyone is feeling that tears are being shed to prepare for a stormy action. <sep><sep> Senator Balancy was greatly affected by creating a "5th community" for candidates who do not want to take part in the exercise of the Best Loser communal. <sep><sep> And we have left all that control in the hands of the private sector itself. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, during these demonstrations (which we have not seen since about 40 years ago), the USA and Europe are collapsing under their own weight, economically declining. <sep> <sep> When it comes to “values,” he wants to say he doesn't know what his "Program" will be. <sep> <sep> In education and in society in general, there is no request that will bring a real transformation in society. <sep> <sep> Today the suicide rate in the country is increasing and exceeds 10%. <sep> <sep> Then PT organizes another sitting of the minority class (establishment and planter), a reign that allows capitalism to continue quietly, despite being capitalist. <sep> <sep> Our slide show was made with a lot of imagination: it contained slides on sugar and rum production in Mauritius, sugar and rum production in Brazil, and on the production of rum by beet, and it was a basis for discussion and mobilization afterwards. <sep> <sep> A second cashier came to GWF, when Yousouf Sooklall, took over as union leader of the French zone, and formed FDUF. <sep> <sep> This is what thirty participants have retained as a great philosophical teacher who has been organized by LPT from November 25, 26, 27, and 28 in Orl Mama Bul Later GRNW. <sep> <sep> Therefore, among the sadness, recognition, anxiety, and anger mixed up and everyone pulled to his side at the same time. <sep> <sep> 9. Then, all this led to a seventh point: the report on forced labor in the country on the issue of mother tongue has been canceled in favor of those in favor of using it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We demand the military base to be closed down as it is becoming more and more dangerous. <sep><sep> Then, when the 2010 elections come, the PT-PMSD-MSM said, in their electoral manifesto, that they would carry out electoral reform. <sep><sep> There have been arrests and pursuits of "Rogue and Vagabond" against Devianand Narrain and Roland Fozoo when they were investigating police brutality, and in court, they defended their case. <sep><sep> It is clear that it cannot be done because if you pay it your full attention, its exact value, one thing would automatically disappear, that is misery. <sep><sep> In the list of papers that Comrade Alain Ah-Vee has given. <sep><sep> - even if no one will be happy that 15,000 young people follow an unrelated report wherever there is a report that has been reported, they will go to report wherever there is a report. <sep><sep> So, on the 27th of March, there will be the General Assembly of Anyel CAWU, Ashok Subron has orchestrated to exclude several other active members of the Central Committee who were very active within CAWU. <sep><sep> Alain also recalled that, even though this system has been abolished thanks to the resistance of its victims and the preaching of humanists, we still live today in a "modern slavery" system with this economic system. <sep><sep> So what we are doing through meetings like this is developing new appropriate strategies for this moment now. <sep><sep> This means that citizens will make the laws; citizens will make the Government and the Government will govern in the interest of the citizens. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a clash between Marx's social theories and his theories on nature for social scientists and activists. <sep><sep> So, there is a tendency to grab anything that one gets, in one's head, one says, "What will I gain from this? <sep><sep> They blame the IMF, WB, bad WTO regulations, de-regulation, and excessive liberal economy. <sep><sep> But for the moment, it knew that the conditions were not in its favor. <sep><sep> and the stress - especially at the Form 6 level, after age 16, the risk of becoming lost for a long time). <sep><sep> In the Lepers there were 3 delegates who threatened and licensed them. <sep><sep> it could be in conflict with the leader of its own syndicate. <sep><sep> We realized that our campaign needs a national gateway to gain more strength. <sep><sep> You will understand why we used political methods to build clear support. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie era, that means, was bringing class struggle and its purpose was for the bourgeoisie to take power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He left five children Nathalie, Katrine, Dado, Patrick, Bruno, and his grandchildren. <sep><sep> - Starting today in a formal way, there will be a unit that will counsel and help teachers find solutions to the difficulties they encounter in their work showing reading and writing. <sep><sep>  Then, it starts to occupy the Government, the State, different bourgeois sectors, also local bourgeois, and imperialist countries that are emerging, such as Jin Fei Lasinn and Patel in Lend with his Neotown project. <sep><sep> Ferney Spinning workers have a reason, it becomes clear on the radio that the Ministry of Industrial Relations should act as an arbitrator: it cannot be biased towards employers. <sep><sep> But, a class policy, it is in fact a shift of political power for the working class. <sep><sep> Some crimes, where people concern their class interests, are not treated with the same severity as others that involve an unknown person since the campaign. <sep><sep> Lalit explicitly condemns the way Paul Berenger is acting. <sep><sep> With this crisis, the people were hoping for a reorientation between political and economic policies. <sep><sep> We have drawn up documents, participated in actions in parliament, and held radio programs. <sep><sep> It is true to say that the written press has been well covered (not repressive) in 2004 on the issue of covering Lalit's actions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> "What is the problem with my "citizenship"; what is the problem with my "people": they overlook class differences, they claim there are no class differences, yet there are significant economic differences causing conflict within this "people". 
<sep><sep> Now, what has happened is the Full Bench has needed to intervene when the Electoral Commission has filed a case in the Supreme Court to demand that it holds fresh elections. 
<sep><sep> Did you really think you could "get away with it"? 
<sep><sep> There has been approximately a 75-80% increase in imports in the past 5 years. 
<sep><sep> According to this quality analysis, the State is made up of severely repressive institutions such as the police, army, private security guards, prisons, courts for criminals, among others. 
<sep><sep> It only goes to the UN, again and again, taking back its statement on the issue when Britain recognizes ICJ jurisdiction. 
<sep><sep> * We are against a policy (like the one the Government has pursued so far) on the drug problem that focuses solely on repression. 
<sep><sep> It could become too centralized, somewhat like the French Academy. 
<sep><sep> Martin Luther King was aware that they were near the end; that Jericho would not have a second chance. 
<sep><sep> LALIT and the Women's Liberation Movement will be launching a book called "DAYERI PALESTINN" by Ragini Kistnasamy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Your actions are decreasing the production of ampheta through the destruction of the reefs. <sep><sep> Therefore, Ramgoolam receives support from some social classes, to implement a pro-bourgeois policy. <sep><sep> At this moment, we are hosting our International Conference. <sep><sep> However, the GRC has a meeting with Mauritius State Minister Dulull (Le Matinal, 21 Sept 07). <sep><sep> Sometimes it will involve guaranteeing the latest electronic gadgets and clothing from American markets, sometimes it will involve contracting refrigerated fish, or it may involve working on a contract. <sep><sep> LALIT wrote a letter to the Prime Minister to express support for this vote in favor of the Palestinians. <sep><sep> He mentioned that the only alternative the government has is within a 6-month timeframe, to "reconsider if the electoral system based on community is still necessary." <sep><sep> Residents, comrade Alain says, are now organizing to overcome this barrier. <sep><sep> He threatens them by saying he will grant permits to replace them with foreign workers if they make such demands. <sep><sep> He also explained that according to his information, a part of these 200 acres has been used to process pig waste in Medinn, but the process has not yet started because the infrastructure for electricity and water has not been implemented. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a conflict between Von Mally and Johnson Roussetty in the Rodrigues Movement. <sep> If he has nothing but his foresight, he will survive, as he is also a worker. <sep> If Jonathan Ravat has indeed managed to serve the opinion of 75 families that civil society can benefit from, he risks being manipulated. <sep> There are certain unions in the free sector, others not. <sep> So, we find a class divide in it. <sep> Zia-ul-Haq was very isolated internationally; he was known as a dictator. <sep> After that, we have written, published, and printed all kinds of books in Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep> The cost of living and inflation is increasing, and the government recognizes that there is a need for a debate. <sep> The DSK case has revealed a weakness in the French press: the media in France are covering scandals and anti-male public figure trends. <sep> He was aware of his great industrialization drive, where at one point there were more than 100,000 people working in French zones: it was an economic boom. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the fact is that the resignation of the deminers was enveloped in a media frenzy, in Lalit we feel that certain facts need to be re-established. <sep> <sep> There is no duty among women, men and children that I have not encountered until now and this is confirmed by M.A.'s family: only resistance will end occupation. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen, member of LALIT was invited to debate on Radio-Plus this evening on the House of Lords committee on Chagos, as well as former Minister Anil Gayan, and Herve Lasemillante, representative of the Chagos Social Committee. <sep> <sep> This document states that PPP is a contract between the public and private sectors. <sep> <sep> Yosi and his eleven backs knew that storms were brewing against them. <sep> <sep> All this means everyone, even editorialists like Gilbert Ahnee who thought our "lost time" campaign was wasting time, are now making a big fuss about food security issues. <sep> <sep> So, his argument is weak. So, when you have all these attempts to create other new historical blocs, with intellectuals emerging from different social classes, especially the working class. <sep> <sep> In a meeting of the London Trade Union Council in 1863, where skilled workers were gathered, they affirmed their support for the struggle against slavery and against all British intervention where the confederation was in civil war in America. <sep> <sep> Only when the National Assembly has decided that the Electoral Commissioner may stop preparations: and according to us in Lalit. <sep> <sep> We have not gone to file it before this Commission for a very simple reason. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the media hardly talks about the reality. <sep>

<sep> Later he joined the Lallah family where he spent half of his time every week, from Friday to Monday with Pushpa (whom he knew since Pushpa was 4 years old) and her husband Rajsoomer Lallah. <sep>

<sep> In the end, the State risked committing the same betrayal that unfolded in 1965: accepting membership in our territory and accepting the existence of a military base, sometimes in exchange for certain economic advantages for the local bourgeoisie. <sep>

<sep> After that we got Jack Bizlall who had met that anarchist syndicalist current and had abandoned political terrain. <sep>

<sep> The first derivative, often in the past they would remind us I have put the emphasis on, the State Zini printing a quantity of dollars it desires, and other countries and capitalists guard that money as their reserves. <sep>

<sep> And this fusion seemed to be televised from Simityer St. Zan. <sep>

<sep> There was some bureaucratization, where there was opposition to the Chagos Refugees Group which had become popular when they controlled the Trust Fund. <sep>

<sep> Ramesh Khaytoo was a member, along with other plantation owners in LALIT like Paul Duval and Ton Benoit, in the La Ferme Mixed Co-operative Farm. <sep>

<sep> Every day there were prayers in churches, temples, mosques, pagodas and mosques. <sep>

<sep> They say they gave LPT that prize because of their work on promoting the Mauritian Creole and Bhojpuri languages, at the same time for his efforts to bring official recognition to these 2 languages. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And in the meantime, he gains the trust of the workers' union, showing that it's possible to confront the state. <sep><sep> Transfer staff members who are on the PRB to other para-statal organizations, or offer them early retirement packages. <sep><sep> Once again, this is a deliberate effort to mask the realities of class. <sep><sep> And in small businesses, it's much more difficult to organize, let alone maintain the class struggle, in its classical form. <sep><sep> There's been a bit more, particularly with the MMM-MSM alliance growing stronger. <sep><sep> Furthermore, the Academy is close to finalizing decisions on spelling in Creole schoolbooks; not just in terms of accents (like whether to include them in words like "an-pasan", for example, or write it as "anpasan" or "an pasan"), but also apostrophes (like using "pu" for "pou" or "li'nn" for "li fini", for example), and capital letters (for days of the week or months, countries, etc or not). <sep><sep> When Navin Ramgoolam held his press conference, it was a big deal. <sep><sep> The opposition Lalit Amendment to the Constitution, brought by the MSM/MMM, is scheduled for Tuesday in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> The Charity Sister went into the pantry to see if there was any information on the tablets. <sep><sep> For that reason, the question that arises for a revolutionary party, for a workers' organization, is that it is an essential condition to be able to face the resistance that may come, even from the state, even from the police. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They knew it would break Timi's morale and bring disorder, confusion, and defeat to the DSD. <sep><sep> In a neighborhood meeting organized by Lalit on the question of alternative economic issues, Rada Kistnasamy took the floor. <sep><sep> His approach was always a shorter-term idea than others but his crooked pot was no longer visible <sep><sep> When a bourgeois section feels blocked, when it feels it cannot expand like a bourgeois obliged to expand and how it believes other bourgeois sections are expanding. <sep><sep> to challenge the capitalist system that is producing the current political and economic crisis. <sep><sep> Samy tried to free his mother and father's rights. <sep><sep> Nobody is happy when you make them even more miserable. <sep><sep> They say no Israeli citizen can have the right to enter the Qalqiliya district. <sep><sep> What government gives us a licensing allowance of Rs 2,000 per month until we get a job. <sep><sep> a revolution that is a "little" isolated in a capitalist sea, it is not easy for it to survive.) In the USSR, after 70 years without political expression. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It has been noted that journalists are being held captive in other countries because they are exposing corruption. <sep><sep> I thank you all for coming to me, give me a word. <sep><sep> Ganga was reminded of his own actions when he was in Devi's place. <sep><sep> So the first trade union task is to fight for the preservation of these fundamental rights. <sep><sep> There is a change in the leadership of Air Mauritius after every 4-5 months. <sep><sep> The only reason the British and the Chinese governments are conspiring to evict the Chagos Islands is to establish a military base there. <sep><sep> This activity was organized following a large wave of protests from the student movement, women's movement, and the general public to denounce violence against women that escalated when a female student in Lynd suffered a gang rape. <sep><sep> Forget-de L'Estrac (L'Express, L'Express Dimanche, 5-Plus), Le Defi's newspaper, News on Sunday, Hebdo, and M.

<sep> The government provides all citizens with a social security allowance. <sep>
<sep> It has been explained that now, every country is supposed to be preparing their "archives". <sep>
<sep> Most Arab governments have gradually become complicit with Israel, they too. <sep>
<sep> And since January, more and more people are thinking every day about learning to read-write, either in French or in Creole. <sep>
<sep> This, we are trying to do it, in this paper. <sep>
<sep> In 6 constituencies where Lalit has 3 candidates, I therefore vote for 3 Lalit candidates. <sep>
<sep> There are certain languages ​​used in many different countries, while there are others that exist only in one country. <sep>
<sep> Each candidate for general elections must classify themselves on his Nominee Paper. <sep>
<sep> It is also necessary not to believe that governments or employers have "given away" this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a very strong and well thought-out speech, Ram Seegobin showed the absence of any reference to any program to address the absolutely catastrophic economic problems facing the people. <sep><sep> The LALIT spokespeople were Rajni Lallah, Alain Ah Vee, Cindy Clelie, Rada Kistnasamy, and in the presence of 8 other LALIT members. <sep><sep> The army raised its fists and blocked the villages when visitors arrived. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth wants to bring back this "poor law". <sep><sep> Alain Ahvee says "This is a fight against the Israeli army occupying Palestinian territory" <sep><sep> We have done this at the same time as participating in 3 union demonstrations in March and April. <sep><sep> The liberation of new strength So we find that, when these dynamics are free, today we find ourselves in a moment where it has become possible to move into a new phase in the struggle for the decriminalization of work. <sep><sep> And today, the MSM is having a hard time disassociating itself from our current Worker's Kingdom. <sep><sep> So, it is clear that it is an imperative to build a mass mobilization. <sep><sep> Last year, during the same period, two LALIT militants went to Palestine to participate in an international solidarity campaign with the Palestinian people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a long campaign against us on this issue. <sep> <sep> At that time when they passed those two anti-union laws. <sep> <sep> My dad was so angry that he was trying to shoot me at school (in fact, until now, sometimes I think he was trying to shoot me at school, because I was really unlucky in school, even getting clapped). <sep> <sep> and different languages ​​seem to be popping up in the world that militates for the recognition of the mother tongue. <sep> <sep> In Lezip, the military seem to always be in power, with the Muslim Brotherhood in the number one spot in elections, with Salafists, radical extremists and members of the government in second place. <sep> <sep> We played an important role in this development. <sep> <sep> This means that the boss can make you work 10 hours a day, then he says there isn't much work and he can send you home earlier. <sep> <sep> Olmert's government does not respect any international law, it has not implemented more than 75 United Nations resolutions. <sep> <sep> He said that no opposition party has yet presented a program, they are not interested in a debate of ideas. <sep> <sep> Only 200 hectares of land out of 1,000 for food security have been secured by Cyril Monty who spearheaded the "Food Security Fund". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Princess Prathna had already entered her final month. <sep><sep> However, in the meantime, when Larzan Lerop comes in to "restrict the economy", what do we find? <sep><sep> In the meantime, he is making it easier for employers to bring workers from other countries to work here on contract - because there are no social costs for the employer to pay (no first day of school for children, no mortality, no marriages, no social life at all). <sep><sep> We have started critiquing the government publicly through the Prime Minister's letter, communicating depression. <sep><sep> The Alliance also had a policy to destroy the light bulb through VRS and Blue Print. <sep><sep> All four major newspapers, they say, have a lot of experience in the field of language. <sep><sep> Not just remaking that risks affecting politics, MMM itself will have to fight against division within its own party on electoral reform issues. <sep><sep> There are ex-MSM members like Shakeel Mohamed, Sheila Bappoo, Vasant Bunwaree, Mookeshwar Choonee, Anil Baichoo, Satiadev Mouthia, Mireille Martin, Jim Seetaram. <sep><sep> For example, last year, comrade Lindsey prepared a letter to address intellectuals, which successfully drew attention to our campaign, while addressing issues of dependency and communal harmony. <sep><sep> However, paradoxically, for the capitalist, the courage to work is not a descending value for him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We also asked the question "What exactly does 'Navin Ramgoolam's economic democratization' mean?" <sep> when he collaborated with big dictators, when his cronies are benefiting from bombings that kill thousands of people. <sep> and now as a counselor to help people have access to all aspects of life, when they are living with a disability. <sep> Underneath there is a MASTER PLAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING ON THE ISSUE OF FOOD SECURITY IN THE BUDGET SPEECHES FOR 2008-9, Minister Sithanen MUST. <sep> After the election, he will only have one control, and possibly a 2nd through Mario Bienvenu from MMSD. <sep> He is also raising his class, he is. <sep> And do you know whether dad did the same, or whether mom did the same. <sep> A new era is emerging on the question of class with Diego. <sep> If we don't make any mistakes they will not look in our direction. <sep> He works either for the bourgeoisie, or for that bourgeoisie government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government has taken another step when the Prime Minister announced that the Chagossians will have a role to play when Mauritius regains control of Chagos. <sep><sep> Therefore, by reducing sickness and increasing local, labor concepts should come under more control of the employer. <sep><sep> They function through electoral reports, and they will correct flaws in a system that they consider good. <sep><sep> Now I need to rebuild it before it's too late. <sep><sep> Electoralism is a form of populism: "Vote for me, and I'll do everything." <sep><sep> We have members in unions where health, municipalities, professors, laborers, education, and other sectors contribute to the Commission. <sep><sep> A section of this petit-bourgeoisie, which, in the 1950s, entered the Colonial Assembly, entered colonial power. <sep><sep> Dick Ng was arrested, he, and now other members are returning to their mother's homes, that is, in the MSM. <sep><sep> All societies have an obligation to take care of the elderly, widowed, disabled, and sick; to guarantee health, education, and housing for all individuals. <sep><sep> This new democratic control that we have on land and sea, moves together with the creation of jobs on a massive scale. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The World Wildlife Foundation, like Greenpeace before them, provides the "blessing" of environmentalism for a clearly imperialist and capitalist private agenda. <sep><sep> In his interview "a-so" with Radio Plus on Monday, Madun Dulloo has clearly indicated that he has resigned. <sep><sep> Even a press conference, they can come, do not report. <sep><sep> He has announced with several references to "comrade Jacques" (Jacques d'Unienville, CEO of Omnicane in the sugar sector). <sep><sep> We know because we have a lot of active family members. <sep><sep> Subron ask the Court to enforce the obligation to classify the Kan Limem when it is put into service in Elections. <sep><sep> Recruitment, except in a pre-revolutionary time, is done one by one. <sep><sep> The government is slow to implement the Pelindaba Treaty! <sep><sep> And when it comes to the case of the worker in Development Works Corporation, it was an error by the Ministry. <sep><sep> Even though Berenger sometimes seems to be speaking in code with his supporters in a somewhat dangerous way when he says "not to make politics worse" or "not to react in a communal way". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the tragedy in Fukushima, Japan, is showing us that nuclear energy is not an alternative to fossil fuels. <sep> "That's what they're looking for, take advantage!" Naturally, it is not a benefit for all. <sep> For this reason, we are maintaining traditions that we have been developing for many years. <sep> It is not only interested in ensuring that workers in the public sector have acceptable working conditions and pay, it is not in its policy to ensure that all citizens have access to public services. <sep> Today, China has finally launched itself into a capitalist production (even though it is still controlled by the Communist Party) and has opened its economy to multinational exploitation to a certain extent, so it has accepted membership in the WTO. <sep> There is very little room for genuine political debate on issues that affect the daily lives of people. <sep> Therefore, we must respond, resist again, and refine our campaign against this new offensive by employers and governments. <sep> (ii) Production: In a Marxist analysis, we find that the "economy" itself is responsible, in essence, for binding all elements in a society together so that people can survive collectively. <sep> It also suggests that, at the same time, we should encourage agricultural diversification through a series of measures such as implementing institutions that regulate prices at a guaranteed minimum level. <sep> Electoral reform is supposed to be an occasion to bring about debate on the ground, a deepening of democracy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, LALIT is not a party that makes a comeback. <sep><sep> There are intermediate classes, which the MMM called an average bourgeoisie, title bourgeoisie, and then a class of workers more proletarian. <sep><sep> We take this into consideration because it is an objective reality. <sep><sep> - We made an important decision where LALIT delegated 2 members in the First Congress of RSP. <sep><sep> In a statement on Radio Plus, Saturday 30 Ziyet, Alain Ah-Vee on behalf of the Lakaz Movement said that the measures in the GM Ptr-PMXD program are not sufficient to face the crisis of the law. <sep><sep> A language that is for all who speak it. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah had a meeting with Alex Callinicos from the SWP in England. <sep><sep> Today morning, delegates from 43 countries, who came to participate in the "Gaza Freedom March," had already arrived in Cairo, and we met for a coordination meeting. <sep><sep> Timi had decided to put the lord in his own way without using brutality. <sep><sep> In August 2008, they went to make a "hedging" contract, a zinc contract. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People are starting to realize the crisis that is happening around us, with a drastic reduction in the prices of products coming to the European market. <sep><sep> This has allowed us to find a better way to proceed. <sep><sep> I have to say that after 1995, when the WTO was created, we had a slogan that we developed: "either we resist or we perish". <sep><sep> It knows that, if you take workers in a sector to work, you ask them to vote one by one in isolator, in a secret ballot, calling that a “secret ballot”. <sep><sep> However, the government, it does not get involved in any of this. <sep><sep> Today, many people in our Republic have realized that during the time of plenty, the majority were in a strong position thanks to the capacity and power of our mother tongue. <sep><sep> In a fairly informal meeting with him and Janet, on Tuesday 14th, there was a sharing of ideas on the situations in Mauritius and Australia respectively. <sep><sep> The time has come to treat different aspects such as: different ways of defining Creole languages, different theoretical perspectives on the development of Creole languages. <sep><sep> The news that a faction of Fateh has launched a physical attack on the army on the other side against Ariel. <sep><sep> We need to be cautious if necessary about the blasphemous aspect by putting the future of the security industry into question - if this leads to blasphemy, then we must be the ones to blaspheme. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If people don't feel like they are being taken seriously, there are some who are taking serious and actual steps and actions for children, which is causing a social crisis. <sep><sep> There is a transparent liquid, which cleans very well. <sep><sep> Due to Subron following his favorite project for "2nd Republic". <sep><sep> During the gratitude meeting, Subron mentioned being mandated by workers in the security industry to thank Nita Deerpalsing for the help she has given. <sep><sep> For this reason, we are holding this Political Seminar about strategic issues. <sep><sep> The law comes out in a way that we do things; how to make regulations; who you can marry; where you can put a food bowl. <sep><sep> Now he has to go through 2 checkpoints in Zatara and Bruqin. <sep><sep> and, equally serious, they are able to control prison guards too, through bribery. <sep><sep> And then, a businessman organized for the man to be arrested for trying to dominate with his family. <sep><sep> He was saying, and he has repeatedly said, "MMM is going to drown", meaning drown together with Union Nationale Ashock Jugnauth and MMSD Guimbeau. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, only Marx who has read these ideas, scientific, real, material (in the sense of physical matter), objective, rational, even political subtext. That same uses an academic arsenal, a journalistic arsenal that can be described as my reputation, a bourgeoisie ideological arsenal, a think tank arsenal, which tries to counter his philosophy. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee spoke on behalf of LALIT to explain how when there is this kind of military aggression, as the Israeli state does, normally, everyone guilty goes into exile. <sep><sep> They are sitting in the IRC, they will decide if UASI will get recognition soon or not.<sep><<sep> By the way, Magistrate Joseph fixed Zizman for the 27th of November <sep><sep> He rebuilt all the estates of the time when all estates had big plantations, now with centralization there are only 5 that have mills, others have plantations but no mills. <sep><sep> Mr. Minister, you will have to remember the student strike in May 75. <sep><sep> 100 biggest companies in Mauritius are listed annually in a book called Business Mag. <sep><sep> He admits now that he could have diversified the economy, diversified agriculture. <sep><sep> the Swing, especially in the north, specifically in Numbers 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15, lots more. <sep><sep> Paulson is asking Congress for 700 billion dollars to do what he wants to do to solve this crisis that is happening (through creating that "nameless" object). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> MMM no longer has any strategy to create its own "Historical Bloc", as it did in the past (before 1982) in writing and otherwise; it is only awaiting PMSD to be out of the Government. <sep> After persisting, finally on 17 April, during a Central Committee meeting, I was able to propose that there be a meeting between a delegation of 3 members of the Central Committee and the Entire Youth Group. <sep> In November 2001, the Mauritian government, through the voice of Paul Berenger, confirmed that there are new secret negotiations taking place between the UK/USA/Mauritius. <sep> From using Twitter and Facebook to organize demonstrations (even though the U.S. secret service uses this method 10 times better for much more chaos or control) to major popularity suddenly converting with NATO's civil war service in Libya. <sep> And it deals with the proportion of money that a worker faces against a capitalist: 1,300,000 people in America have not been able to continue paying for their homes. <sep> "I agree with what ex-PM Ziz Robert Ahnee has written in Le Mauricien yesterday. <sep> LPT, who has long wanted to publish this kind of thing, has finally proposed to publish it for the book. <sep> Even though the new cultural movement was still very marginal, it had spread almost everywhere where small groups were forming to give lessons in literacy, encourage literary creation and make femininity understood in people's minds. <sep> The government has taken a stand behind the leadership of the deputy, behind the leadership of the Mauritian people on the issue. <sep> Among these eleven resignations, five members of the youth group are involved. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the Lalit, we have gained 44%, 14 out of 32. <sep><sep> Until there is no political budget policy based on energy: what is certain and certain, however, is that there will be a new generator in the old Fort George model. <sep><sep> And Ziz, this too, may bring different enemies. <sep><sep> At the same time, we are voting to choose which Party or Alliance to form the next government, who will be the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> There may be two terms for a term, two terms for two years. <sep><sep> The text has caused a lot of discussion among present people, as the situation varies like the Revolution of the Lasinn, the situation in Mauritius, the role of different social classes in a revolutionary situation. <sep><sep> And after her death, Benazir Bhutto (daughter of Ali Bhutto) became an icon. <sep><sep> After that, whatever this worker is, he exposes not only to the dominant ideologies but also to the dominant propaganda, newspapers, TVs, and radios. <sep><sep> Because finally, this man will tell you, "Get out, man, if I give you such a thing, my business will no longer be profitable, I will no longer make a profit, I will have to close." <sep><sep> That means he won't hesitate to say how much he earns. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, it is interesting to find that the campaign against Lasinn is gaining momentum, as their government is repressing protesters in Tibe and where unfortunately several deaths have occurred. <sep><sep> When the crisis comes, many classes often react in various ways. <sep><sep> Whether you are in the union or not, it is binding. <sep><sep> When it changes, it is mostly dialectical, it is an evolutionary sentence. <sep><sep> In an article in Lettre de L'Ocean Indien (must pay online to read it in full, so we are not sure what he said, except his first couple of sentences). <sep><sep> On Saturday the 24th of October, the members present at the four-day International Labor Education Hearing presented their findings. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the trade union movement has weakened and has faced sectoral problems. <sep><sep> The organization that was born in historical riots, it does not easily disappear. <sep><sep> Through chaos and war, it has continued since 1995 (indeed without any deviation since this grotesque sign) as it was until 1917. <sep><sep> We have finally succeeded in lightening it from this totally whimsical fantasy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Code Pink, an organization founded in the United States which is also a member of the NO BASES network along with LALIT, a member of the Front. <sep><sep> In this deviation, certain individuals have played a role in the bourgeois press. <sep><sep> Thus, the enemy that the enemy has is one main class (workers) that is beginning to challenge another main class (employers). <sep><sep> It's not so much defined as whether one is white-skinned or black-skinned. <sep><sep> There is no longer a "society project" in mainstream politics. <sep><sep> We used to eat cake, drink fizzy drinks and coffee - it was somewhat like an MLF event. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth, he will have to run for office in the Rose-Belle constituency. <sep><sep> When a worker takes action in the company, it will develop an interest in its actions bearing fruit, gaining more value, meaning that the company will make more profit, therefore the worker (including themselves) work harder, becoming more productive. <sep><sep> It specified the Indo-Mauritian because at that time before Partition, the Indo-Mauritians in Mauritius wanted to be recognized as both Indian and Muslim people. <sep><sep> But when we look closely at cases in Court, who do they represent in reality? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, what characterizes the government of the Ptr the most during these 5 years is its economic policy and its Minister of Finance. <sep> <sep> When life was in abundance, a lot of wealth was born. <sep> <sep> It would marry a boy from his nation, make children from his nation and keep the customs of his nation. <sep> <sep> Because that goal is not good for us to stay. <sep> <sep> A party like LALIT, it will grow faster naturally in a moment where the working class mobilizes more, during what in English is called an "up-turn". <sep> <sep> In his report Dr. Surnam writes that when Kaya was singing, there was a sound coming out of his scalp to his ears and there seem to be ten that were collected behind his ears, on his hair. <sep> <sep> As we know today, all these concepts of "democracy", "law" and "rights", come from within it. <sep> <sep> His work in the BEC to train a generation of teachers was also very important. <sep> <sep> We are not interested in promoting our partisan interests in the short term, nor in reducing the weight of the post to a candidate position or even just as a Best Loser. <sep> <sep> This kind of solution diminishes the power of workers to demand better conditions and also fuels despair among workers, sometimes even xenophobia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So now we need to be careful of the Social Alliance which is putting forward its own candidate while pretending to support Pravind Jugnauth. <sep><sep> The police officers were beginning to enter one by one. <sep><sep> What is consistent in everything he does is his leadership. <sep><sep> Since the first colonization, history had been deposited in the earth of Jericho with the promise of a culture that would bring sweet and bitter fruits. <sep><sep> We know that the patron is looking to change the IRA to try to implement the Lim Report, which the trade union movement has rejected. <sep><sep> There is music that comrade Rajni and his musician comrades have given us. <sep><sep> The first document we made, Rajni showed himself, it was in 2003. <sep><sep> It is clear that as long as our economy is controlled by capitalist class and their advocates in government and state, we need to militate and mobilize to establish a socialist system where the economy is democratically controlled by the working class to live. <sep><sep> At eleven in the morning, when the Cabinet of Ministers is meeting, we managed to block the traffic. <sep><sep> Today, it is even more necessary for the working class, youth, small farmers, women, students, and unemployed workers to start thinking about developing a platform based on a revolutionary socialist program, like the LALIT program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The environment, environment, Food Security, family bed, Diego, anti-military base, Palestinian, international contact. More articles need to be published in the press and on our website. <sep><sep> But what is more important and what will ultimately determine the success of our program, is not what another Minister does, but the strength of mobilization. <sep><sep> It really unfolded like a tornado, week after week. <sep><sep> The encouragement of planting tubers continued in sugar cane plantations, rather than making food production more attractive. <sep><sep> Stress on a group of workers, more containers coming in, or perhaps getting a worker to leave when there is this stress, he will only have to walk around for 5 minutes every half hour. <sep><sep> We have also come to know that as long as a person is recognized as the owner and director of the total means of subsistence in society, the State will be compelled to have recourse to a defense against violence, and this violence must be necessarily, too often, poured out on detainees in the cells. <sep><sep> Then we all got reports that lalin, we work in a normal rhythm. <sep><sep> Here we are beginning to understand more precisely what ideology means - such as ideas, knowledge, traditions and cultures. <sep><sep> And this is what makes it fantastic that today we are managing to get together. <sep><sep> So, when LALIT makes a decision on how we participate in elections, it depends on how these possibilities unfold. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is an analysis to understand the ongoing economic crisis where the critical proposal of the government and employers to gradually come out of the crisis. <sep><sep> It is only the wealthiest who are responsible for their capital gains now. <sep><sep> There are fewer farmers, small landowners who will benefit from it. <sep><sep> It is true that there is work in Cyber City, but it doesn't help 40,000 unemployed and continues to increase, it does not help 10,000 artisans, nor does it help 50,000 garment workers who have been facing layoffs. <sep><sep> Like slavery couldn't continue, it is hindered by contradictions in society. <sep><sep> Today, multinational companies are taking control of each other. <sep><sep> Samy learned from his mother how to take care of clients, take good care of them. <sep><sep> On bedridden patients that they had begun to take care of, on the sofa that they had taken care of. <sep><sep> He started threatening workers with licensing, with a baton, with prison. <sep><sep> With the knowledge of all these people, the Mauritius Rodrigues found ways to plant tools. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The resistance movement is being blocked internationally all the time, but now it is becoming more difficult. <sep><sep> If someone wants to cast their vote, they will have to take it from there on their ID card, look for the first box, put a cross, second pair, the first laser marker they will cross. <sep><sep> The gossip was not aware of where they were going. <sep><sep> LPT runs its course, people follow, become members, participate in activities to promote the language, LPT runs its language training, it runs its publications, people read those publications. <sep><sep> In other sectors, there are some immutable facts (in billions of rupees) only for training courses to fill the void when there is less guaranteed work per week, or to depend on employers or other measures such as "tippy-tippy" expenses. <sep><sep> When we were a Dutch colony, it was ruled by a Company, the Dutch East Indian Company, the Dutch East India Company. <sep><sep> This alienation is almost total, except perhaps during great moments in history, great isolated moments in an uptrend, as in the Upheaval of 1979. <sep><sep> Now often stopping at a small house where Sinndi was staying. <sep><sep> When we were watching, and then discussing this film together, we realized the importance of a Film Clip. <sep><sep> Berenger's defensive position, the lukewarm position, two philosophical views, but politically he needs to stay calm about his well-being. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So we find that the members of the LALIT movement have taken action in the women's movement based on our political program, allowing today, this 1,100 women's associations in each neighborhood. <sep><sep> Among these, people have come to know that the state is responsible for perpetrating this violence against Kaya, violence which led to his death. <sep><sep> And when this bourgeois state is developing, it is a bourgeois well frozen in the laws that it is a new bourgeois, it has not yet consolidated itself, it has not yet developed its means to exploit workers. <sep><sep> and they weaken the ruling class - by themselves. <sep><sep> Ministers and departments are recruiting without going through the PSC, like in Singapore. <sep><sep> When Navin Ramgoolam says he wants to revive that old Worker, that's funny. He prefers to become like SAJ was in the 80-90s. <sep><sep> The developments that capitalist system and its ideologies are promoting, put us, working class in a dilemma. <sep><sep> So workers had so much confidence in him, he became a "bridge" between distress collectors (brown sugar procurers) especially in Mauritius and exporters. <sep><sep> During G.Duval's arrest in 1988, there were fascist excesses by PMSD and MSM members in Flacq and Curepipe. <sep><sep> On the other hand, people are saying "Let's get Berenger out, let's get Pravind Jugnauth out as Finance Minister," and "Ramgoolam is telling us that he will put "people first" and we, we are "people". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Like arrangement and presentation of products in a supermarket and shopping leisurely with an easy checkout process makes us feel like we are in a wonderland where everything is perfect. <sep> <sep> There was an important note on the Minispality of Grand Baie-Bonnevene on the administration of 'Tantinn Timi'. <sep> <sep> If you start questioning capitalistic logic and it starts becoming a movement, and a mobilization behind its new logic, then the union can fulfill the third role it is supposed to fulfill. <sep> <sep> The purpose of this Historical Block was to expand the social capital base (to make more people become capitalist class that were included during colonization) so that it is not just the powerful oligarchy. <sep> <sep> Obviously, in this capitalist era, the role of the media is important. <sep> <sep> To condemn the behavior of the past 5 years, people in power used communal discourse in their official functions. <sep> <sep> As a result of the environment and its health, and on animals, it is entirely unpredictable, and with recent studies in Great Britain showing an increase in allergies due to GMOs, <sep> <sep> "Clash of Civilizations" by Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington, published in 1996, where he says the future conflict would be based on religion. <sep> <sep> For the Government to adopt a resolution, it must complete the process thoroughly. <sep> <sep> When they are caught, they can commit crimes to earn money for a dose. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He will have a discussion with Assirvaden and Virahsawmy. <sep><sep> It is not a social class that has the floor to sow, neither capital to launch it into business. <sep><sep> But as the majority agreed with me, the discussion has come to a halt. <sep><sep> Every decision represents an official recognition for the Creole language. <sep><sep> You can laugh, you can die defending it, it, it will continue to maintain the same level of life, it will continue to change its Mercedes to bring bananas, all 2 bananas. <sep><sep> So now there is a new proposal and negotiation, and all of that alongside a major propaganda campaign, threats and pressures through the craftsman's guild of St. Felix. <sep><sep> It is a program developed through respect for principles, first and foremost. <sep><sep> When Jamouna was about to have a large political development in Gonndouana. <sep><sep> And also how scientific progress can be observed in the well-being of all humans and in an environment without pollution. <sep><sep> Indeed, when introducing the mother tongue as a size alone, it tends to reduce the scope of all community organizations, too. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The current system cannot contain our demands. <sep> <sep> Everyone was cooperating and helping each other. <sep> <sep> So there are in private law, in practical private lawyers, in books from the country it is the same, you get answers that are given, what the law says it is. <sep> <sep> The tourism figures outside are also decreasing, and the number of tourists is decreasing. <sep> <sep> 6. Like Navin Ramgoolam, despite saying he is against these communal-religious societies, he continue to make all his important declarations, h He really pumps them up. <sep> <sep> For this reason LPT says we must remove these prohibitions. <sep> <sep> like GMOs, which are mainly aimed at ensuring the profits of the multinationals that control this technology. <sep> <sep> Sometimes he is furious, he hits the boss with an iron rod, it happens. <sep> <sep> Also we have to remember that it is through the political struggle that we aim for change, an economy that challenges all the problems of society. <sep> <sep> When we talk about "objective factors", we want to talk about economic realities, more State reality, geo-political reality. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are certain conscious practices that have been framed by abstract and universal ideas. <sep><sep> And, when Capital 23 UT signed, even if he was a victor, there were certain clauses that were not respected. <sep><sep> When you walk on La Chaussee Street you'll see people asking for help! <sep><sep> In 2006, 15-year-olds did the same thing, including other people like Jean-Jacques Arjoon, Sedley Assonne, Alain Muneean, Arnaud Carpooran, Jimmy Harmon. <sep><sep> It is not useful to go down the street and pick up, prices are rising, there is no work, this is the case, and everyone just says it is under the store. <sep><sep> Details on the different groups that will play in the future. <sep><sep> First, the money "accompaniment" is not used to destroy employment, but to create employment. <sep><sep> And all measures to ensure profitability in the short term establishment will not be enough to face this kind of price reduction; and to plant it will be a real disaster. <sep><sep> And this first session, through history, informed narrative, it has in a simple way made an introduction to these different forms of class struggle. <sep><sep> And the WSF forum has excluded contesting movements from the economic sphere, and at the same time has excluded political activists from it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We hope that there will be more discussions to deepen democracy in a broader way. <sep> Through reading his life story you get a perspective on how he will live and survive under military occupation, as the Palestinian people have done for 40 years. <sep> Ram Seegobin said that Seychellois philosophy is monetarist and ultra-liberal, inspired by people like Friedman, Hayek, Reagan, and some of Lee Kwan Yew's 'social repression'. <sep> And to put an end to what is happening now, with compulsory education, a linguistic genocide. <sep> Even if LALIT's actions have brought about this position, in fact, it is a PT that has this flexibility because it can measure a political line vis-a-vis a specific class it represents, and measure it against the block that it has brought together in the elections. <sep> So, there were members who were more pro-MMM, and they allied themselves with officials who were in the LDK, and they did not entirely go when LALIT stood as a candidate, because they are implicated and have to become politically active in public. <sep> It was tough because he took a stand against the camps. <sep> In our assessment, we have seen what we have done, but as a Party, we must also be able to decide what not to do, with a kind of union or political event that should keep us somewhat far away. <sep> The Movement for Family Liberation met with 60 families on February 28, 2004 to draw up a list to send to the Ministry of Women's Rights, and other authorities. <sep> There are people who put emphasis on the ambitions of the Jugnauths with the backing of the financial power of Sun Trust. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We were watching a cataclysm unfold on TV, where entire villages and cities are being destroyed, swept away, battered, by a 10-meter-high wave, when TV announcements are obsessively repeating "19 fatalities" or "26 fatalities". <sep>
<sep> Then, when the Euro loses value by 18%, oh! The price keeps rising. <sep>
<sep> He sees it as a responsibility, a pact, between the parties. <sep>
<sep> We want everyone in Mauritius to understand the demand, reflect, develop the will to put this book and its content in front of the Government. <sep>
<sep> And from that Stalinist reign established in the 1920s, there has been a "book" a "deviation" in this history, where capitalist history has continued into the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy, Japan. <sep>
<sep> If there are 10,000 workers in a plantation there, how have these 10,000 workers not defeated the boss, who has to stand up against these 20-15 bosses and supervisors? <sep>
<sep> Military Base Diego Permission US from UK diplomatic preparation that President Bush was taking for his final military offensive against Iraq, had an item of "propaganda" on BBC radio. <sep>
<sep> The bourgeoisie who felt their threatened power has become even more common than the petty-bourgeoisie block. <sep>
<sep> There are 2 ways we can look at this issue: Firstly, the pseudo-trade union bureaucracy as we say, and secondly, the pseudo-trade union members. <sep>
<sep> But, if we understand that the old "Historical Bloc" had finally been destabilized from the moment when the WTO had fully fallen, i.e. when protection from Europe (quota and price guarantee) becomes illegal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now there is already an immigration officer to protect the rights of victims. <sep><sep> Where exactly it has been explained how it will work (See the article on the web there). <sep><sep> This past Saturday, LALIT organized a Political Education session in Flacq. <sep><sep> At the same time, when Creole language, a language that is still prohibited in most government institutions, is given some recognition side by side with 45 other languages, it offers a certain recognition to the language. <sep><sep> We can say that there is no true editorialist in Mauritius today, with enough skill to analyze politics. <sep><sep> This large profile comes from the humble background of the poor and the worker. <sep><sep> There was also a heated debate on the role of the President of the Republic, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, who still has a very important political role even if she is in Reduit, especially since she is the head of Sun Trust. <sep><sep> She said that Lalit believes that we cannot "legitimize" this arrangement by running candidates. <sep><sep> The LPT has maintained that the government should promote mother tongues such as Creole and Bhojpuri, and should not perpetuate language genocides. <sep><sep> She said that the crisis could be attributed to several factors, including climate disasters affecting production in several countries including Australia, Pakistan, Laos, Latin America, South Africa, energy crisis, where cereals and agricultural land is being used for biofuels, and punishment in eating habits, especially the excessive consumption of meat. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If a person feels that they have been unfairly treated in a job interview, has the qualifications for the job, and did not get the job; if they feel there is any form of discrimination for any reason, they now have a labor law where they can make a representation in front of an Equal Opportunities Commission. <sep>

<sep> His family, friends, fans and the Mauritian public have the right to know how Kaya died in police custody. <sep>

<sep> it's a political program that challenges the international capitalist economy. <sep>

<sep> And so I call on the working class to remember that it has a historic mission and its historic mission is to eliminate the system of exploitation by the bourgeoisie. <sep>

<sep> Monday, as they arrived at work, the boss sent a message via the supervisor, telling them to come to the office. <sep>

<sep> After the rebellion in 1999, the Catholic Church conducted a widespread investigation. <sep>

<sep> And now, Lagres has found itself in the same situation, reserving a 2nd bailout of 100,000 Euros. <sep>

<sep> it is acknowledging the weaknesses and limitations of the WSF facing the crisis and saying that it believes it is time to build another, more political international. <sep>

<sep> It must act before knowledge of plantations and forestry disappear. <sep>

<sep> They are finding ways for the government to reduce to a simple facilitator for the private sector to govern itself. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So today's question is about refusal and the question of Palestinian citizenship. <sep><sep> Even members of the 4th International Quran who criticize the internationalist strategies that their organization has adopted. <sep><sep> My job is to cut paint for sandwiches, not to take them, fill them, go to the counter, serve the customer. <sep><sep> And he even went to the Banwell Report to explain how this is possible, that is, no one declares their community in the Nomination Paper, but then there is a communal correction decided by the Electoral Commission! <sep><sep> At the same time, when she is in forced labor, this gives her economic independence to fight patriarchy in the family, and it also helps to strengthen the working class. <sep><sep> In this conflict, there are points being openly discussed by the public, such as the transfer of 2,000 arpents of land, renegotiation of the Tablisman-CEB electricity contract, warning shareholders in the sugar/refinery/ethanol/electricity clusters. <sep><sep> This depreciation means that the inflation rate has increased by 19%. <sep><sep> When we arrive in Hares, in the center of the village, there is a soldier's camp. <sep><sep> After independence, the SSR Government set up a colonial state that allowed a regime that holds political power to influence the formation of social classes and the creation of a new capitalist class through certain discretionary powers and sometimes arbitrators that ministers have. <sep><sep> But, only when you say you won't work, the State - that great force in the patron army - it, it will be included. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There has been a meeting between Gorah Isaac, Cehl Meeah and others on the oriental languages. <sep><sep> You either need to take notes quickly, or you might have difficulties. <sep><sep> He announced that a new law has been passed and that only a consensus is needed before passing it in Parliament. <sep><sep> However, when we get it right, what we call "capital", we tend to believe that on one side of society there is labor, and on the other side there is capital; we say that there are workers, then we say there are capitalists. <sep><sep> "Democratic" as used in Section 1 of the Constitution, could have been interpreted differently in 1967, it could have meant that every community is well represented, for example. <sep><sep> to provide support for a global coordination that works and has the capacity to develop an efficient international campaign strategy. <sep><sep> Every time the terms "agricultural diversification" or "food security" are mentioned, we can be sure to have a small harvest propaganda fabricated by establishments or at least disseminated in the interests of establishments. <sep><sep> Plantations, shops, small businesses and trading allowed life to continue and large businesses and transactions were far away, as if reflected in the consciousness of the majority of the inhabitants of Gonndouana. <sep><sep> What kind of amendments were voted on April 9, 2013? <sep><sep> They were absent, while in the political arena, when workers in Lesbos, Tunisia, Morocco were protesting, while the Islamists were politically organized. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government is also hesitant, even though it tries to hide its actions in a calculated manner. <sep><sep> On Friday, 29 Ut, Fim K-Lib watched the film FRIDA, on the life of the Mexican artist and revolutionary Frida Kahlo, directed by Julie Taymor, a woman most known for her groundbreaking work in puppetry. <sep><sep> Berenger is not even certain that, if there is sovereignty, he can, perhaps even, as Prime Minister, guarantee the Chagos Islanders the right of return. <sep><sep> Then the board will draw up an Award that will stand as a labor law covering all sectors. <sep><sep> It is this political preparation that has enabled LALIT to react quickly to the instability and degeneration of the mainstream political parties that have become clear. <sep><sep> and we will participate in protests against the abolition of subsidies, which we consider an unacceptable measure by the government of Social Alliance. <sep><sep> So, every day that passes, we find that there is a division brewing in people's minds, and ultimately they find themselves in a state of confusion. <sep><sep> By participating in democracy, we can play a small role here, but the State exists in favor of the ruling class. <sep><sep> The olive branch has strong emotional value for people in Palestine. <sep><sep> The CAWU, Construction Workers Union that Devianand Narrain headed, has resolved itself, as members of LALIT have resigned since the executive of CAWU did not agree. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, the boss said, "Abe, what should we do?" <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen, a member of Lalit, just got great news today that she has won the Commonwealth Prize for Africa for her novel called Boy. <sep><sep> At the Sunday Member Assembly on December 16th, Lalit members shared a report for 2012, before gathering for a feast. <sep><sep> Unless one questions this capitalist logic, linking arm in arm with the police and attaching themselves to power, it is imprisoning a logic that ultimately affects workers. <sep><sep> It is imperative that we confront and change this power that controls our lives. <sep><sep> One for the police, one for the Church, one for the newspaper, one for MBC TV. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the union work that RA does, whether in the private sector, transport, the sugar industry - creates problems that unionists call "scabs", meaning RA walks on the picket line with its comrades from other unions, or another federation. <sep><sep> It is necessary to take the time to dissect this concept. It is vital. <sep><sep> Prevent farmers from occupying their olive plantations, it is also another way to hoard land. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy gave a political report on Lalit since the last Member Assembly 3 months ago. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MMM leadership quickly took back the reins of the capitalist section (which he called "Patron du progres") and took back the idea of Universal Suffrage. <sep>

<sep> M. Monty has pointed out that this frequent figure (Rs30 billion) for agricultural imports is because of his involvement in the "Agriculture" section of the party. <sep>

<sep> and Editor-in-Chief of Adsvwen Le Militant at the time, Gilbert Ahnee, today editor of the daily newspaper, Le Mauricien, that is to say perhaps the most powerful people in the Rivet group, after Jacques Rivet himself. <sep>

<sep> Perhaps, if he is handling it as we find it, and if the Zini government continues to print its dollar, perhaps other countries will collapse before us. <sep>

<sep> We will return to the Bonapartist State in this session. <sep>

<sep> Shouldn't we strive towards a development strategy that guarantees food security for the people, that leads to optimal use of the country's land and sea resources, that ensures social rights for all citizens, and that creates balance? <sep>

<sep> Our argumentation follows as such: * Police are workers too, just like all other workers, they should be free to form a union. <sep>

<sep> But I will be there, and at all times I will be able to contribute, give my little bit of thought, my word, my actions. <sep>

<sep> This linguistic situation is not normal; it is absurd, irrational, undemocratic, and most of all, it is perpetually silencing our children in schools. <sep>

<sep> In LALIT, we oppose this kind of state control. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This measurement tends to favor natural regionalization voluntarily and at the same time allows intelligent parents to assist in improving the level of all schools through participation in PTA. <sep><sep> it's not just demands that we have agreed on, it's demands that we agree to fight for, demands that we mobilize and organize to support in every way. <sep><sep> The root cause behind all this political crisis today is not just moral decay or political corruption. <sep><sep> So facing this historic bourgeoisie that is much stronger and has strengthened its ties through this 20-year neoliberal banana, Navin Ramgoolam is clearly using international capital to serve the historic bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The Chinese State sometimes, when it suits it, uses the presence of Lasin as a pretext to strengthen its military presence, its imperialist presence. <sep><sep> For example, in Europe, when there are governments that emerge from workers' movements like the British Labour Party, the French Socialist Party. <sep><sep> Sometimes they use a favorite little slogan, Fanfan Tabardenn, to negotiate a nomination or promotion and how they get their demands in their assertive language to hold on to the effort to win something in Euro-Kreol lottery. <sep><sep> In recent years, UNESCO has recommended using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction since the 1950s. <sep><sep> The study has shown that children in Zambia have been educated through the English medium. <sep><sep> It is a demand that questions the capitalist system itself, because the capitalist system is unable to offer what you are asking for. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, what other methods do you have to bring your story? <sep><sep> Mohammed said it's not my law at all, I'm simply saying it's what I found in the revelation. <sep><sep> Finally, all judges have questions and found that there is a serious sexual harassment problem. <sep><sep> Either they were going to have a Creole computer program. <sep><sep> The Program Lalit has been developed in a collective way with the help of branches and Lalit militants. <sep><sep> And, when Stalin gradually took control of the apparatus from 1924, he consolidated power as the rightful leader of the party, and from 1930 onwards he began to suppress all revolutionary militants in the USSR. <sep><sep> This resulted in all sorts of crimes: in the working class people started falling into lumpen-proletariat, in all sorts of rulership; prisons began to fill up; intra-family camps started to increase; drug problems soared. <sep><sep> So, you put all things in that you think will win you elections. <sep><sep> We learned this yellow crime from the Workers' Struggle in France. <sep><sep> to make Mauritius a SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) court. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Objective factors, this is what we analyze in society (at a national level, and its links with the global), and subjective factors, it mainly concerns the construction of an organization to be able to implement our program. <sep> Then – and this is why we are writing you this letter – there has been and there still is and will continue to be a conscious effort by the US Embassy to silence NGOs. <sep> Collecting stories on the African Continent that will allow more people to have access to this cultural richness. <sep> And during these 2 days, we hope, in LALIT, to find flaws in political parties more clearly when they cannot create a way out of these capitalist crises, a way out of this environmental crisis. <sep> This allows for a bureaucratic sclerosis, which allows 2-3 leaders to speak for the workers, as if the workers themselves know. <sep> After the 2010 elections, MSM had 6 Ministers and 6 Deputy Ministers in government, along with PT and PMSD. <sep> Gianduth Khaytoo, also known as Ramesh Khaytoo, founding member and activist of Lalit, who passed away Sunday, November 29th following a severe stroke, he was one of the great heroes that John Lennon called a true Working Class Hero. <sep> At a certain moment, there were even 3 SSU jeeps in the neighborhood. <sep> And at the same time, a new morality for another class is still not born. <sep> He said that this action coincides with a series of events: a few months ago, the International Criminal Court decreed Israel's state of emergency illegal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this country, without visible leadership, every corner of the country has been barricaded. <sep><sep> Through AGOA, everyone has been integrated into the US market, and as a neoliberal example. <sep><sep> After a long discussion, he finally picked up the phone and I believe his supervisors have given the okay. <sep><sep> Given the differences in the political landscape of the various parties, especially the MMM, we have come to understand that it has become a Worker. <sep><sep> Suddenly, we realized that, eventually, we had to "change course." <sep><sep> So, it is a combination of a "Historical Bloc", which, although it is sometimes punished, but which has traditionally been around the sugar industry until the current strict crisis. <sep><sep> And in the conflict that occurred between the Government and the sugar industry last year, which was once unthinkable, has become a real possibility: Prime Minister Ramgoolam has publicly discussed the option of relocating if the sugar industry does not improve. <sep><sep> There is a place in the neighborhood where there is still a dance in the mirror. <sep><sep> The Seychelles government has regained possession of its islands, which were illegally occupied in this fantasy land called BIOT. <sep><sep> There is an Obeegadoo positioning himself as a Berenger political certainty. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government post-apartheid emerge as the most tragic, as the USSR collapses: it becomes a pro-capitalist government, even pro-imperialist. <sep><sep> It is a good reminder that X.Duval himself was an expert accountant and at one time, he worked for a company whose main sea side was experienced in privatization. <sep><sep> This manifesto has helped us a lot in guiding us in the early years and as time passed, we deepened our manifesto. <sep><sep> That is, voting against solid waste, against the VRS, against repression, against generalized privatization which led to an increase in the prices of postage, telephone, electricity, and against class inequality growing with a process like the IRS. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen explained how this is the only testimony that incriminated Cehl Meeah and accomplice Gorah Issac, who were the main culprits. <sep><sep> It seems socialist, they say, has not succeeded. <sep><sep> Father Martin King felt that if no one intervenes to curb the hostility that was developing between Afro-Creoles and Endo-Creoles in a dangerous and uncontrollable situation, it could lead to destruction and an arms race. <sep><sep> He, it was none other than who worked in this international network called NO BASES, which LALIT provided support in beginning of 2003 together with other organizations such as what Wilbert was involved in. <sep><sep> and he was also trying to maintain his political presence in the countryside through his trade unions. <sep><sep> And this idea helped to forge an extraordinary bond between the women's movement and the widowed woman. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The tears have once again watered the small olive trees. <sep><sep> Due to precarious work, according to a survey by LALIT, many Mauritians work informally without even a payslip. <sep><sep> He is happy to keep a reserve of summer tears aside, so that if his workers demand better pay or conditions, he tells them, "If you leave, I have 10 others like you looking for work at this price, under these conditions." <sep><sep> It is a way to describe, to know in the government who is more trustworthy. <sep><sep> The police are arresting someone here because the boss said he was trespassing, another for an illegal demonstration, a worker there because he had a knife with him, whatever it may be. <sep><sep> For all these reasons, the LALIT party is against the introduction of Electronic Voting Machines in Mauritius. <sep><sep> * There are rumors that the union will not challenge this alienation that exists in the workplace itself. <sep><sep> Berenger realized that Ramgoolam was still playing him, and he is preparing his response. <sep><sep> Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Greece again, one after the other, are going bankrupt, are using up their new money. <sep><sep> It is we who are promoting the use of the mother tongue in the education system, in favor of environmental protection, the right to a minimum wage, and family rights. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But we say that we need to reorient our economy towards an alternative economy based on agricultural diversification, agrarian reform, and food production where it can create a massive shift. <sep>
<sep> "Many of them say," Victor Serge wrote, "that the whole Stalinism was in Bolshevism from the beginning." <sep> 
<sep> - 'No, I'm not done yet.' - 'Ram, do you really have a problem?' Kamini asks him. <sep> 
<sep> * The Diego Garcia base must be closed, along with more foreign military bases. <sep> 
<sep> But, it requires a high level of organizational structure that is solid enough. <sep>
<sep> Here in Mauritius, the press is silent on the crisis for 3 weeks. <sep>
<sep> Clearly, this has been blocked since before this new war. <sep>
<sep> This general election that has just passed was similar to the 1967 elections in many ways. <sep>
<sep> The challenge ahead of us now is for all intellectuals, all individuals in Mauritius who can read and write, to understand the research that has been done (both theoretical and survey-based), and to transmit it in a clear and precise form, so that even the everyday person who speaks Creole can realize that their position is not favorable to children. <sep>
<sep> To bring about a process where they are going to change as much as possible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> REMINDER ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: Let me remind you that before our campaign, no one mentioned unemployment benefits. <sep><sep> After that, the President responded by saying 'people say what they want, as for me, I will do what I want.' <sep><sep> And you have now managed to take care of the political terrain we were in LALIT, we had to take care of. <sep><sep> There are limits to police and prison guards using violence. <sep><sep> Following the statement of the Vice-Prime Minister in the National Assembly, the young members of the Lalit Youth Group present at the IRS have confirmed. <sep><sep> In Bolema Holding, there were many good actors but it was Sir Ralph who had the leash that made the puppets dance. <sep><sep> He keeps continuity in a moment given where political consciousness can be higher, where class consciousness can be lower, or lower at another moment where he can be higher or lower. <sep><sep> When they were in Havana, they visited an organic farming center that operates in a cooperative system. <sep><sep> - 2,000 acres of land that the government has at its disposal to grant the owner of a mill permission to operate the mill, so that the mill owner can benefit from Lerop compensation. <sep><sep> If they had used more formal Creole, they would have developed their own formal language in Creole. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are vast differences between what is called Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). In Mauritius, most children, even those who reach University, face issues with their cognitive learning, meaning CALP. <sep>
<sep> All these "reports" have one thing in common. <sep>
<sep> Its historical mission is to end with the capitalist system. <sep>
<sep> The LALIT work balance for 2012 is well rounded, and different areas of LALIT work have become central to the political landscape of the country and the world. <sep>
<sep> So they used the Court as a platform to popularize their ideas in favor of the unity of workers on an international level to bring about a struggle against the bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> What Anand was doing meant that there was a certain mobility in the ladders that people were climbing, but it was being presented in a way that made it seem like people were just climbing higher. <sep>
<sep> You can file in Creole, because there is an interpreter who will translate. <sep>
<sep> Shortens to coalition for mediocrity are talking about "Electoral Reform". <sep>
<sep> So whether it is the Government, the Opposition, the Trade Union Movement, they are all not in a position to face the immense difficulties that society has to face. <sep>
<sep> * There should be an "Optimal Land Utilization Authority" ("Authority for Optimal Land Use"), rather than a "Sugar Authority", which is obsolete. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Their greed also contributes to aggravating the crisis. <sep> <sep> Since 2005, Sithanen has had an economic policy aimed at making the economy "resilient" through depreciation and layoffs, meaning making the working class bear the burden of the economic crisis. <sep> <sep> This depends on military bases, covering more than 700 bases in 40 countries. <sep> <sep> Since 2008, this has created breaches in neo-liberal buildings. <sep> <sep> Clearly, a program to bring socialism, it relies heavily on mobilizing the working class. <sep> <sep> He made a request that the police pursue the three policemen who guarded Alcatraz when Kaya was found dead, namely Police Nepaul, Anne-Marie, and Ramdin. <sep> <sep> The motion was supported by an Explanatory Memorandum explaining in 15 points, the arguments of the Mauritian State on this issue. <sep> <sep> The second wave of VRS ensures that there will be no permanent employment for workers. <sep> <sep> One (para 165) is about the secret way the state operates in Great Britain, the other (para 25) is about how the Zizman Novam 2000 in the Supreme Court of London has revealed the terrible conspiracy. <sep> <sep> More attention is now turning towards L'Alliance Sociale which has left MMM-MSM, but soon we will see the importance of this difference. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Obama's speech began very clearly: "Let me be clear. <sep><sep> So, for the third time, we went to the Government House Square, opposite to Victoria Square. <sep><sep> And since the 1950s, it has been led by a particular class, a bourgeois section, an heir - state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we are particularly affected by the crisis in the Euro Zone because our economy is fragile, because we are economically dependent on Europe. <sep><sep> So, it is working hard to bring this historic block together. <sep><sep> If it's good for the cow, why not try it with the goat? He connected an old radio set to his radio and everything people heard about the goat they heard. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who was chairing the press conference, began by saying that Lalit had decided to hold this press conference at a difficult time in the country, where the debate on education is getting dangerously out of hand. <sep><sep> Students say that the size of the university they study in has become more "integrated" rather than separate. <sep><sep> At that time, there were banners of FPU, Regional No 19 MMM, MSM, GWF, Union National! <sep><sep> Busy with laptops and answering calls while following the situation in Jame'en and coordinating for Wednesday's event. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As a conscientious worker, he fights capitalist exploitation through his union, the trade union directly concerned with our struggle. <sep><sep>  They know the pattern that has been established since 1987 is the same, where the former ruling party tends to lose in the general elections. <sep><sep> This capitalist logic ultimately leads to demobilization among the working class. <sep><sep> When there is a dispute between the trade union and the employers represented by MSPA in the security industry, there has been political intervention, not state institution intervention, but direct politics. <sep><sep> The report of another aftershock at 6:03 a.m. <sep><sep> I think international support makes it difficult for the United States to support Israel. <sep><sep> They talk about "violating" and "drugging" but they don't mention killing for money, or killing for real. <sep><sep> Even if they are in the executive, even if they are delegates, they are not in this bureaucracy. <sep><sep> And the employers themselves who have maintained a monopoly control over the majority of land. <sep><sep> Other people are demonstrating in front of their Hotel (a different hotel in Cairo) because the Egyptian police and army are not letting them out of the Hotel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They endured his tyranny and brutality, his sickening dictator, so they added. <sep><sep> I'm busy doing laundry in the garden. <sep><sep> He asks whether sustainable development, as a concept, is feasible for us alone? <sep><sep> In the last 3-4 years, pro-capitalist ideology can no longer disguise the crisis, the crisis in the capitalist system, and those very people who were talking about eternal capitalism - in The Economist, New York Times, etc. <sep><sep> We demand it to commit to UNESCO to respect the languages people speak at home, and to introduce it as a medium at all levels in schools. <sep><sep> The government must invest (and encourage investment) in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, wave, and tidal. <sep><sep> Our enemy's enemy, NATO is costing, is installing missiles on the borders of Earth and Lasiri. <sep><sep> We have a duty as a party to create opportunities, to put forward ideas for everyone to think about, which we can create together for the future. <sep><sep> Without a fight, you don't preserve these rights. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said that the disagreement we find today between MSM/MMM, he finds his roots since the Sachs Commission itself. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said that only 13,500 arpents of land (according to him) are needed to achieve "self-sufficiency." <sep> He has announced his intention in his Bidze Speech to introduce what is called "targeting," which means "aiming." <sep> Since its inception, it was a strong form of development. <sep> Transport workers took a wheel to Belom, took a wheel to Beler, took a wheel to Triolet. <sep> There is popular commercial music on Chagos in the beginning, and the narration is done by Olivier Bancoult who comments on the images in Mauritian Creole. <sep> Mohammed's mom (a 60-year-old family member) was very interested in knowing why I left Mauritius to come to Palestine for work. <sep> education, based on scientific knowledge and also taking into account the interests of all children of the Republic of Mauritius. <sep> Certainly, unions need to put emphasis on their own organization, especially when there is sexual predation. <sep> Meanwhile, we have become more aware of the political importance of a Review for a party like LALIT. <sep> If anyone considers how we entered LALIT, then we can develop multiple qualities through different methods, different ways to approach people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have been living this way for 10-15 years now when large companies like Ferney, CIEL, Floreal Knitwear all find that they can go to Madagascar to have their clothes made cheaper. <sep> <sep> Bidze's speech implies that the global economic crisis, and especially the European crisis, have had no impact on Mauritius. <sep> <sep> To avoid this, we must encourage students and workers to mobilize behind points that clearly favor progress, behind a clear program. <sep> <sep> The government must change the laws on biotechnology so that they are based on the "precautionary principle". <sep> <sep> As you know, democracy means not only that everyone has the right to vote, but also that everyone has the right to stand for election. <sep> <sep> We have to look at the quantity, in the Media, look at how in a capitalist world they are doing everything possible to break Cuba. <sep> <sep> There are participants who have spoken of difficulties when an Opposition is trying to find an opportunity to enter the Government. <sep> <sep> From Nablus another one is going to the village of Tall. <sep> <sep> This is for several reasons why, in 1982, we resigned from the MMM. <sep> <sep> In this Review, we have started to develop an analysis of the state bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the first round, he didn't say anything about 40%. <sep> <sep> And he remained a pro-oligarchy newspaper columnist until he stopped writing in 1970, when the oligarchs decided to remove him politically and socially. <sep> <sep> They criticize him when he's not good for bureaucracy, even if he's good for the workers. <sep> <sep> And Navin Ramgoolam is advancing in his role as a monarch apprentice. <sep> <sep> Thus, the new dissenting voice in the villages- the new dissenting voice is no longer considered just a sound, a necessity, a big power. <sep> <sep> 5) GEOGRAPHIC INTERCOURSE CRISIS: What are the consequences of such crises on the geographical space of the crises? <sep> <sep> Finally, we have no peace beyond these 8 years. <sep> <sep> But, it's a political struggle in the union, not just something we can expect the union leadership to do. <sep> <sep> Why has Mauritius lost its control, its sovereignty, over Chagos? <sep> <sep> A worker higher than us, an Englishman, calls me when I finish my job. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to a survey conducted by Tel Aviv University and published in Haaretz newspaper on February 27th, 66% of Israelis. <sep> <sep> How many workers are able to express their opposition to the pro-employer policies that the Labor and MMM parties are pursuing? <sep> <sep> 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons have initiated a hunger strike to demand an inquiry into the death. <sep> <sep> There are other minor newspapers that are entirely government-funded, such as Le Socialiste and Quotidien. <sep> <sep> We went on the Al-Jazeera website where there was a new article in Arabic. <sep> <sep> When workers have an opportunity in a historical moment to take control of their enterprise, it is extraordinary. <sep> <sep> There is a journalist who described Ramgoolam in a win-win situation, today, I see Berenger in a "lose-lose" situation. <sep> <sep> This alternative is embodied in a socialist political program aimed at creating a new economy, an economy controlled by people who actually do the production work. <sep> <sep> This was on April 26, 1852: "The sandlot movement is irregular and turbulent, but its trend is constant". <sep> <sep> Development in a second or third language must be based on the development of the mother tongue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, establishments would resume work on the 6th, 7th and 8th of January, for the first 7 days the boss would force or take over all the premises, and the rest of the year there would only be 6 premises left.

<sep><sep> Because this is true, many people have a piece of themselves still outside, either because they feel common, or because their dream is to be outside, or because they feel that Mauritius has betrayed them.

<sep><sep> This manipulation has developed through another resignation, which came from Rodrigues.

<sep><sep> Just because the state bourgeoisie is acting like the historical bourgeoisie, it will be a mistake to enter into the Historic Block that the state bourgeoisie is slowly forming and is trying to re-establish.

<sep><sep> 1972: New vote in the United Nations: 95 countries voted in favor.

<sep><sep> In the Cabinet, there is a Minister who is appointed and removed by a single person, the Prime Minister, who has reached there because the President of the Republic called him because he found his photo on a column during the electoral campaign and his team won more seats.

<sep><sep> Nearby the church, Loryann started to cry and when she arrived in front of the church she held her stomach and told everyone who was looking to be away from her.

<sep><sep> But for the boss to make more profit, he needs to break the workers a little more and license a little more humans.

<sep><sep> Today he was moving in another direction, followed by Bannwas.

<sep><sep> All doctors who have examined his body and made pathological reports on their inanimate bodies to say that he died a death that was not natural. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, if you are on Blok 104, the boss, considers me not as "say progress", he is behind. <sep> but it also includes rights to military aircraft and 'drones' (large, unmanned aircraft) taking off and flying in the airspace in a clear manner. <sep> Yet today, Ramgoolam and his PT-PMSD-MR-Transfiz government seem to be well advised by an accumulation of institutional and political crises. <sep> When people go to visit that house, costumes, lists are sleeping in it. <sep> That will allow him to permanently adapt his program, amend his program, change his program where necessary. <sep> And MMM-MSM won 3-0 in the four constituencies, namely numbers 1, 17, 19, 20. <sep> A Labour leader had said Swami Vivekananda Pailles, but today they are announcing that he will be in Vacoas. <sep> Everyone in the country has heard Minister Soodhun threatening workers in the Zone Franche on the radio. <sep> You go to work, after a while, you come home, you eat, you drink. <sep> There is organized crime that is part of the mafia, that is, they are millionaires, while prison guards wear the same uniform. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the USA, under neoliberalism, there was a manifestation called "Occupy Wall Street," which happened in more than 100 cities in the USA. <sep>

<sep> Then, when his images come back, he makes a funny mistake, he says: "Thank you, and sorry for keeping you waiting!" <sep>
<sep> "What is interesting today for Lalit", he says, "Are the themes on which we have been campaigning for a long time, today, you find that they have become dominant in the political situation. <sep>
<sep> Only in times of great crisis, then forced to mention - this is also preferably not in politics. <sep>
<sep> when words of good health were engaged, then some progressive ideas that were still strong enough. <sep>
<sep> And it allows for the complete decolonization of Mauritius, and then Africa. <sep>
<sep> We need to provide the necessary organizational means for the success of our program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And in a crisis like this, if you are trying to find ways to address the issue, you must come up with alternative solutions where there is a level playing field. <sep><sep> "The idea of basing this livelihood on the State comes from a different idea that we had in the Congress Lalit in February 2008. <sep><sep> it is not certain which factions in the Government are responsible for this type of repression against people like Nelson Mandela felt, people who were involved in denouncing the newspaper Le Defi, after a communalist editorial that the newspaper published. <sep><sep> Zilber and Kolo who mixed their mess with the mire have lost control and when they started to squabble, asking for reasons to double by the time we agreed that everything was supposed to be shared equally. <sep><sep> One of the reasons why i said the same thing as we did in the security industry, and today our cement industry is being democratized. <sep><sep> And among us, there is a civilization that has become extinct. <sep><sep> All movements in the Middle East have had a direct impact on the balance of power in Palestine. <sep><sep> The systemic crisis was already there, but the Euro crisis aggravated it. <sep><sep> But the colonial state has used repression against the working class, laborers, artisans, and part-time workers who were organizing in associations. <sep><sep> Comrade Jane, Comrade Reeaz, remember the Food Security Act that Jane talked about, there have been the same debates, the same meetings, companies, and unions have gone into their executive power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a natural power transformation that we, on our part, must bring and apply from now on to the name of the general population. <sep><sep> And we believe that in general there is a social crisis that will emerge from the way they are trying to restrict a section of the population, because there is a totally unacceptable threat. <sep><sep> And after our Theoretical Seminar, what we predicted would happen started to happen in front of our eyes. <sep><sep> Because everything else—serious matters such as housing, education for children, a motorcycle needed sometimes just to get to work, a fridge, a washing machine needed to allow families to work long hours, and also everything else around—everyone else for their small business where ¾ of the doors close after 4 years. <sep><sep> Similar to George Orwell's book Animal Farm; what belongs to us shall stay ours, and yours will remain yours. <sep><sep> Nevertheless, in some parts of the world there are attempts to identify and change the factors responsible for creating the crisis. <sep><sep> There were other inhabitants visiting for solidarity, all the Fata factions were present. <sep><sep> He said it doesn't concern sovereign issues or military base issues. <sep><sep> Today it's been over 6 years since Kaya's death. <sep><sep> There have been no attempts to initiate a common platform with a socialist program in favor of the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 2011, before there was a crisis in the Government, and when there was a large mobilization in the Middle East and North Africa, we dedicated time to analyze the political situation. <sep><sep> One of them is a university that is military and civilian at the same time. <sep><sep> So in a situation like that, we can have 4-5 workers working together, saying immediately we will solve this problem that the toilet is broken, and filling up the holes. <sep><sep> Instead of the society moving forward, this is bringing an unacceptable historical regression. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Mr. Autrey, who was an ideologue of the sugar industry, and at the MSIRI Institute (Mauritius Sugar Institute Research Institute), took retirement. <sep><sep> - even though there were 15,000 instead of 2,000 - 3,000 people; <sep><sep> But, during breaks, he was more active in the sports field. <sep><sep> There are around 100% in total, partly, in all countries. <sep><sep> All this means that these figures like 20,000 of them are a fraud. <sep><sep> And, when it is disintegrated, it has 2 signs that it can take. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The way Israel has designed this mirror's path allows it to confiscate 50 litres of water. <sep><sep> Among them, 5 numbers relied LLRT, Immedia its collection of stories, a book for children 'Kirouni, Kirouna' by Playgroup. <sep><sep> After the general election, and after the first 100 days where universal old age pension and free bus transport for students and pensioners have been reestablished, now there are signs of austerity: <sep><sep> At the time we were suffering all sorts of repression and intimidation from the Authorities and the Police. <sep><sep> When TCSB was launched, it made book licensing easier. <sep><sep> In addition to circulating the Creole newspaper in 1,000 copies per month for a decade, with more than 100 people writing articles in Creole, LALIT has influenced the development of the Creole language, particularly through the formal resistance form and threatened the Creole language for abstract thought discussions. <sep><sep> And he will create a job, especially in construction. <sep><sep> In a situation like this, where there is no Governmental Plan to face the systemic crisis that is emerging, the Opposition, be it MMM or MSM, they, so far, they have no alternative. <sep><sep> So LALIT approached a PMT (similar to OPI which had joined Bizlall Party). <sep><sep> First of all, most of the prisoners were imprisoned in their "teleological thinking" - that is, thinking in a linear manner. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the other hand, this new capacity that has been acquired through a formal method called "literacy" allows for accelerated development of what we call the ability to handle academic and cognitive languages. <sep><sep> And not too far behind, there are means like in the case of Gaetan-Duval, to declare an "independence" for Rodrigues, where French imperialists and pro-South African imperialists have entered. <sep><sep> These people, I do not find them participating in the literary class. <sep><sep> It explains how the Israeli army prevents Palestinians from living a normal life: they are forced, along with their children, to show their ID just to go to school, to work, to visit family. <sep><sep> Meaning to reach the same level of issues with the Privatization Fund: <sep><sep> There has been total confusion for 7 long years over whether the Resistance is seeking to advocate for the "abolition of Bad Loser" or rather just "abolition of classification of candidates" (like Balancy, Banwell, Subron, Bérenger). <sep><sep> For example, if there is an issue with weed growth, to clean it, it needs to find a weed killer that will not harm the grass. <sep><sep> In the beginning of this new system, there were anti-union laws that prevented all forms of unions. <sep><sep> Analyzing the behavior of Mauritian political parties and Mauritian ruling classes in relation to the military base, and the arguments that represent the local capitalist class interests that were essentially the basis of the detachment of the Chagos from Mauritius in 1965. <sep><sep> Another danger would be the privatization of the nuclear power plant; because then since the power plant generates profit, the management does not perform the necessary maintenance to prevent production from stopping (It is exactly what happened in the ecological disaster case of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It concerns nuclear disarmament (LALIT which has brought up the issue against the military base in Diego during their 30-year party) and to strengthen the base and stop the war. <sep><sep> Has anyone ever criticized the CTSP and brought other groups together with them? <sep><sep> There are developments in different industries, yes, most for export. <sep><sep> When the bourgeoisie brought its class party to gain political power, it already had economic power. <sep><sep> Berenger says to eliminate obligations, but keep the best loser system. <sep><sep> In conscious practice, a person goes to work, drives home, goes to school, does duties etc. but also has these abstract and universal ideas like: <sep><sep> In that sense, the Muvman Travayis, its political party and its labor movement since it also created its labor movement called MLC, Mauritius Labour Congress. <sep><sep> They look for other things, a lady, creating a Council and a man. <sep><sep> In the police force, for example, you get a patriarchal hierarchy from its commissioner to mere guards under the pyramid. <sep><sep> Only then will Navin Ramgoolam name his ministers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And if we leave a door open for the bourgeoisie to gain many people, our strategy of overthrow must be questioned. <sep> <sep> In Lalit we are launching a campaign to defend fundamental rights in the Welfare State so that elderly, sick, and disabled pensions become a universal right that the MMM-MSM Government is attacking. <sep> <sep> It is not necessary to bow before establishments and historical bourgeoisie for political financing. <sep> <sep> Our theme this year is "Umbrella for all people". <sep> <sep> And JUSTICE has become a subjective factor that has become chaotic in this confused system. <sep> <sep> When there is another crime, while discovering a corpse, when you hear that this lady was watching her own grave while she was still alive with her husband. <sep> <sep> In Washington D.C, there was a conference hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. <sep> <sep> This does not mean a way to deal with issues that have communal implications. <sep> <sep> After the speech by comrade Ahmed Khan, there was a very interesting debate on the situation in Lagos today in Pakistan and Afghanistan, on what ML and Maoist culture mean in this region of the world, on the nefarious role of NGOs involved in private "nation-building," and how privatization of the oil sector and "nation-building" breeds endemic corruption. <sep> <sep> This means that facilities for derocking, which already exist under conditions where you only plant sugarcane, need to continue to exist but under conditions where the produce from what you plant goes to food, not just sugarcane. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He thought it was because they knew Balram who was a very popular person in the village. <sep><sep> He used the term "lokater" (immigrant) to declare himself as a true owner of the country (a real Mauritian), meaning he supported the memory of that campaign Ralliement Mauricien. <sep><sep> He buys and sells data, and his private profits depend on finding more and more and more people in his Facebook network. <sep><sep> The fact that they continue to suppress the mother tongue in schools, they continue to make children's editors. <sep><sep> But, when properly looked at, does the security industry have, or did it have, a future. <sep><sep> The democratic principle requires that anyone who votes has the right to revoke it. <sep><sep> "The most important thing I have learned from Prof. <sep><sep> 25% of the oil used by the USA is transited through the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> LALIT has persistently opposed the policies of the Labour

<batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government mantra has not changed in these 2 years, but the economy is still in trouble. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie has developed especially in the French Zone, as well as in substitution industries (tea, pineapple, plastic), and we are starting to see small capitalist companies Leal, aurel, SAMLO, Gamma Civic, to name just a few. <sep><sep> These speeches have become a political failure exposed by the Government to embark on a proportionate economic policy with the ongoing food crisis. <sep><sep> The opposition against Chavez was strong and they launched a campaign against him, for example to tell people to watch over their belongings, to cut cable wires, and to sabotage other work. <sep><sep> Like a distant and beautiful North Star, the immobilized black and white strategy began to falter. <sep><sep> The trade union strategies that Berenger and MMM applied in GWF finally went in the same direction, which is to strengthen bureaucracy. <sep><sep> Another problem is Infinity, we found Jeff Lingaya, an individual who has caused some uproar, becoming a "symbol" that the trade union movement has gradually abandoned. <sep><sep> Here, I am referring to cane workers, dock workers, farmers, and transport workers. <sep><sep> It explains when Shakeel Mohamed said he would introduce sanctions in labor law to stop working on contracts. <sep><sep> They

THE SPACE GROWS After his high school diploma, Tanby wanted to go to university to get a degree that would allow him to teach in schools. <sep><sep> Due to Creole language, which is not only the mother tongue of ¾ of Mauritians (among other things particularly Bhojpuri), but it is also the vernacular of the Republic of Mauritius, and since it is not used as a medium in schools, many children find themselves excluded from school at an early age. <sep><sep> 2.The police union is particularly important, as it potentially allows for a more democratic structure to act as a counterbalance to the entrenched hierarchy in the police force. <sep><sep> There were many written maps by delegates from different countries attached to ballistic pontoons, and they were floating downstream on the Nile River. <sep><sep> This triggered contractions, a cultural shock, and it was significant. <sep><sep> And it was transmitted through political leaders such as Thatcher and Reagan, and it entered the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, which then became dominant worldwide. <sep><sep> If the information published in Le Defi is true, Prime Minister Berenger is trying to find a way out of the terrible situation that occurred between 1982 and 1987. <sep><sep> Right behind him, there were two chairs placed near the door, one on each side. <sep><sep> What is happening lies in the catastrophic collapse of the Dollar, at the same time as the dollar crisis, another major currency used as a reserve, namely the Euro, is also in crisis. <sep><sep> In the labor sector, when there is a direct threat of privatization, we find an intestinal struggle between 3 labor unions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We bought a pack of 400 rupees, which ended up in that hole where the cigarettes are

in Chile. <sep> <sep> Under the pressure of this crisis, the Prime Minister is becoming more like a monarch. <sep> <sep> The working class still hasn't found the difference (which becomes evident during large-scale actions) between real actions, like digging the earth to make bricks, writing under the sun, and creating permanent bureaucratic structures (which exist in a given system, like the capitalist system). <sep> <sep> This also creates an imbalance of power between the bureaucracy and the people. <sep> <sep> However, it was noticed that when it will come to power, it will end up giving PSM Harish Boodhoo (a cashier from the Labour Party) a tough fight. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, the Labour Party, with its 10 points, is not a serious opposition compared to the chaotic MMM program. <sep> <sep> BIT's mandate is clear: come forward and say what you need to be able to find a solution to collaborate. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the Labour government has made a conscious effort to support the sugar industry and there is a historical block realignment with a new balance in this sector. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Within the Facebook system, there is usually a group that covers various topics. <sep><sep> During that time, there were many union meetings with workers in Manchester and in London. <sep><sep> The reality is that the anti-imperialist struggle is facing challenges. The Lalit anti-imperialist movement is faced with many challenges in this new economic situation. <sep><sep> "24 years after I first read the poems that appeared in the pages of Ti bato papye, like a member of the jury for the first Literary Contest in Creole language, it is with the same pleasure. <sep><sep> Ultimately, a federation is supposed to represent the interests of a whole class, that is the working class. <sep><sep> A strike can be spontaneous, planned, sectoral, or general. It can be a short strike, 3 minutes, a day, two days. <sep><sep> A lot of people, especially well-informed workers, in one way or another, are facing a situation. <sep><sep> We have prepared a document, with 7 members of the Commission. <sep><sep> It can be a simple matter, like in Bedz, he can get a bonus. We were already asking, "Well, what will happen after 2009?" It's a two-fold issue that surprised me a lot. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The financial backers, on the other hand, make the MSM more Bonapartist. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna thought the Bannwas period was coming to an end. <sep><sep> Mauritius had a full backing from the US for its election. <sep><sep> It is clear that it will give him a significant financial advantage. <sep><sep> It is not an industrial crisis, it is not a French zone crisis, it is not a beach crisis, it is not a budget deficit crisis, no. <sep><sep> Instead, it is a political war that will expose us to, that will help us understand why LALIT has managed to avoid falling into disrepute. <sep><sep> Exxon Mobil has also funded campaigns to discredit the Kyoto Protocol because the protocol represents a direct threat to their profits. <sep><sep> All degos parties, all degos organizations, they are supposed to, I say they are supposed to, defend the working class. <sep><sep> The fifth phenomenon we are experiencing in Mauritius today, through the WTO, WTO, all these courts like the Lome Court. <sep><sep> On the occasion of Labor Day, we look for solutions for the working class as a whole. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The three Confederations are going through an internal crisis that is paralyzing them: there is a lack of reflection on the situation of the working class and the dance scene that is becoming more pronounced with new laws, price increases, and job insecurity. <sep><sep> At the same time, it is certain that the bourgeoisie class and a section of the working class (through the MLC) are using it to their advantage. <sep><sep> There is a small wave that the labor dispute has taken that is heading in a certain direction. <sep><sep> The new Jugnauth plan (and Ramgoolam?) calls for an "Economic Re-structuring and Competitiveness Package (ERCP)", and what it has in common with the Sithanen plans is that they all aim to use public money to support private enterprises and guarantee profits for capitalist companies. <sep><sep> The labor struggle, like a last-ditch effort in the fight against injustice, has been trivialized by the two actions that have taken place at the beginning of this year. <sep><sep> Who will have the power to decide on contract allocation, tenders, promotions, and who will get the 'Jackpot' like State Land for a hotel project? <sep><sep> The BEC has already introduced a similar quota for admissions in its colleges. <sep><sep> The government has already begun and is continuing efforts, for example, to strengthen Integrated Resort Schemes so that capital in the security industry can be recycled in tourism without losing value. <sep><sep> So many Israeli soldiers are waiting for them, they have decided not to pass the AKOTE checkpoint to avoid confrontation. <sep><sep> While defending best loser today, he is not defending it as a philosophy, but in his political partisanship, where he has become the spokesperson for minorities. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You may have someone who always wears a suit and goes to the club in the evening, works as a corporate office secretary, and is a union member where he works. <sep><sep> The negotiation results have said more than 2 years: accept the US Base on Diego. <sep><sep> We are getting mark lines, hamburger claws, and all kinds of licenses, where a percentage goes to imperialists. <sep><sep> The hope that the struggle in South Africa and international support has brought apartheid to an end is very important in this particular moment in today's struggle in Palestine. <sep><sep> But you, you are correct on an ethnic (sic) and money plan. <sep><sep> Tell the MMM-MSM on the basis of a single point: Bring decolonization, in other words, a Republic. <sep><sep> If anyone wants to make a comparison, Ragini was Palestinian and had a diary online just like Septam 2004. <sep><sep> Then, a women's group in MLF and also in Lalit on the 9th day of the hunger strike, have formally decided in a meeting to take a historic initiative. <sep><sep> - Your daddy unhappy? Unhappy your daddy? - Not that unhappy there. <sep><sep> So if we cannot learn to master the language before feeling lazy, how will we ever be able to understand all its grammatical complexities properly, like other people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But we have to watch that our relationship with workers, with the people's army does not depend on the capitalist bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> But the Treaty is important, because Diego and Chagos are part of the Republic of Mauritius, which is part of Africa, and the Treaty that has just been ratified, prohibits all armaments and all nuclear materials used for warfare in Africa and its surroundings. <sep><sep> When Ram Seegobin responds to this call, his full report will focus on the local and international political situation in 2011. <sep><sep> Indeed, a good demand is calling for a "Unity, in every hospital room for women who have suffered sexual aggression", a Rape Crisis Unit, that is what they are calling it. <sep><sep> All the children who were already in school early in the morning were shouting "JEYSH, JEYSH" to tell us the army was there yesterday evening. <sep><sep> Dharam Raj suggested that they go and meet President Jericho and ask him to request the intervention of the army to restore order and peace. <sep><sep> Previously, the tax system in Mauritius was equal to the economy and the historical blockade that was in power was restructured with the support of the establishment and a disciplined workforce. <sep><sep> The cyclical crisis was also attenuated, technically, by spending on armaments, during World War II and the Cold War. <sep><sep> Since yesterday, as I heard my 'old pot' life proverb come out of my mouth like an oracle. <sep><sep> Finally, in the 1870s, for the first time, the working class took power, with the Paris Commune – 100 days. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Most recently, the Ramgoolam government commissioned the Carcassonne report to address its concerns to make a reform that gives it semi-presidential power where it can appoint but not elect ministers. <sep><sep> When they said "namaste," they cheered, went into his house, came out with a bucket and started throwing dust at him. <sep><sep> He may become a threat to the expansion of the Kreol language. <sep><sep> In this 9, 3 have already crossed the critical threshold. <sep><sep> And Xavier has already told him not just to "put on an act" like Ramgoolam, after a drama. <sep><sep> And this reality is making his ideology weaker. <sep><sep> mainly because their leaders are focusing on finding a "winning formula" to win the next general election. <sep><sep> Usually "tonkin" is used in a somewhat frivolous context. <sep><sep> A brief moment, like a vision, his own image seemed to appear in front of him as if he were looking in a mirror. <sep><sep> This Koran challenges the fact that chance must obey the law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes, when working hard pays off, it can bring a lot of benefits, for everyone. <sep><sep> We need to respond to complex and complete arguments like the Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission, Jean-Claude de L'Estrac, who said "Navin Ramgoolam has won Diego". <sep><sep> When we look at the crisis happening in North Africa and the Middle East, it highlights the same serious global crisis that we are experiencing here. <sep><sep> And material productivity, on inequality, on the exploitation of a class (which survives by selling its strength, courage, and time). <sep><sep> When we gain allies, we gain a punishment in the balance of power. <sep><sep> Then the Welfare State's basic point is that the State provides medical care, the State provides free education, this is the foundation of the Welfare State. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the role of the CIA in all these movements has become clear. <sep><sep> I don't know at this moment, all the Mauritians, what were they thinking? <sep><sep> Even when the government is trying to "resolve" the crisis through "Duty Free Island, it is exacerbating it. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the MSM strongly supports maintaining an electoral system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ramgoolam, for example, has suggested the electoral reform issue requires constitutional amendment for a Second Republic with a President and Prime Minister sharing power (an alliance between the two issues raised by Bizlall, Subron espousing during their campaign for the Second Republic). <sep> <sep> Well, what we are discussing continuously is the "good governance" issue. <sep> <sep> Within MMM, Berenger stands out between a faction mainly in favor of retaining the Communal Best Loser System as it is, and other currents that are more "progressive", but also more elusive. <sep> <sep> What was interesting was the refinement they found, including one of the refinements that stood out in 2002. <sep> <sep> Radio provides an additional dimension when broadcasting its creativity through music, feeling. <sep> <sep> Furthermore, there are constant maneuvers and warnings from the US Embassy - maneuvers clearly highlighted in the last batch of Wikileaks documents, which the US did not appreciate. <sep> <sep> Over 50 strategic commodities for the USA across the Indian Ocean: metals such as manganese, cobalt, titanium, chromium, platinum, lithium, nickel, tungsten, iron, lead, and zinc. <sep> <sep> In other words, they will not have to pay any corporate tax on their profits. <sep> <sep> In terms of the healthcare sector, there is a case before the Competition Commission against BAI Insurance for favoring the BAI-owned private hospital Apollo Bramwell at the expense of public hospitals. <sep> <sep> But, to paraphrase Balancy, it's different from what he really wanted to say. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he is not surprised, because he is spending money on 2 wars in Iraq, a war in Afghanistan, and having more than 700 military bases around the world, plus he has done bailouts or recovery operations when there was a financial crisis in 2008. <sep><sep> Yesterday in a Press Conference, Lalit explained our participation in the election campaign and also presented our program in the context of the election campaign for the election on 5 May. <sep><sep> When a graduate in Zone Francaise 15-20 does not get another job. <sep><sep> He buys our courage, to make his capital more capital. <sep><sep> Clearly everyone has a very different interpretation of the class struggle it is. <sep><sep> and means the introduction of new laws that regulate working conditions that will further reduce working conditions. <sep><sep> and engineers in the reduction of hours through a centralization, price increases in the local market, reduction of money taken by the government on export revenues to finance quasi-state industry. <sep><sep> We were satisfied with our demonstration on the first day. <sep><sep> Then in its list, for a second fraction, there was a manly resignation. <sep><sep> Father Labor gives details on internal conflicts in the Church. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, traditional politics revolves around gaining power in society as it is. <sep><sep> The price of rice has increased after a 2-month hiatus in rice production, the quantity of rice has increased as the rice harvesting season has resumed. <sep><sep> Therefore, the union movement is saying "Not everything is about oneself, not everything is about one's self", "This is a right, we need to protect it." <sep><sep> Notable figures in GSEK had started a campaign to fight for job security, for its mother. <sep><sep> The Lim Report, the TULRA/NPPC Bill, and ex-Minister S. Soodhun's White Paper." <sep><sep> What at the time of general elections, what not - and at the same time develop ways to advance in the workers' class. <sep><sep> In recent history in Mauritius, MMM started with a slogan "Class struggle, not racial struggle". <sep><sep> Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth is trying to tackle tax evasion. <sep><sep> Dharam Raj, this man, this scoundrel according to some people, he was finally an icy nemesis, just like Fanfan Tabardenn. <sep><sep> We had start-ups, where 4 out of 5 went bankrupt within the first 3 years of existence, and they employed people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So finally, the US location did not bring anything to Afghanistan. <sep><sep> Today, when there is this economic crisis, when there's a response starting from oppressed classes, they are forced to admit that they no longer have the capacity to influence what is happening. <sep><sep> Especially in the context of the worsening economic and social crisis. <sep><sep> It closely followed the resistance in Palestine, as well as the role of England, France, and America in this conflict. <sep><sep> 4. Despite this, we have taken several remarkable actions – concerning Chagos, concerning Socialism, our State of Emergency concerning politics today, Gaza and Palestine – with very broad activities and many successes. <sep><sep> A lot of trade unions, especially in small sectors, may be better. <sep><sep> Now there is a dilemma as to who is a union leader. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Jugnauth balances one side of the issue with PTR and says he knows that it is a member of the Minister in PTR who is involved in the Medpoint issue. <sep><sep> However, we find that there is an issue related to CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), and it can become dangerous. Especially these two issues together. <sep><sep> Do you understand why we worked without relationships to change the balance of political forces in the country? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There were a lot of criticisms about the role of certain doctors in the case of Mr. Ramlogan. <sep><sep> After 8:00 in the evening, the police came from the other side of the mountain to stop the stone throwing towards people taking shelter. <sep><sep> LALIT has already hosted an early morning programme on MBC to get new news in Creole. <sep><sep> He said the food security in Mauritius is "zero" and that it is a danger. <sep><sep> Mrs. Macque, is a witness who along with LALIT militants Roland Fozoo and Devianand Narrain have filed complaints against the police. <sep><sep> In the night, like a bird, his name flew in the sky. <sep><sep> Regarding the question of sovereignty, today MMM's position is "Anu talks to the English", we tell them "Let us control the other islands, on the Diego Garcia issue and the base, well, we agree to disagree. <sep><sep> When you understand the class struggle, then there will be no problem. <sep><sep> Immediately we have got people who will say "No", they do not agree. <sep><sep> Members of LALIT cannot claim they are not LALIT when they do this work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When a country declares bankruptcy, when there is a lot of destruction, then the capitalist system gets a small respite. <sep><sep> Cehl Meeah also kept up with the news with his allegation that Minister Herve Aimee received 25 million rupees from Gro Derek. <sep><sep> The reaction of the working class, the trade unions, is a rather harsh reaction. <sep><sep> For the election, we ask you to vote for Lalit to build the movement that is necessary to secure rights for everyone. <sep><sep> This legal crisis has also exposed a census that is used as propaganda to make people believe that more than 80% of people already own their homes. . <sep><sep> With the new ERB Bunwaree, fiftenn 90 have been introduced. <sep><sep> This is why we propose that an MP is needed. <sep><sep> Yesterday, it was a bankruptcy that we in LALIT, we do not understand, especially since L'Express has supported the Labour Party politically for the last 5 years. <sep><sep> What we already import, and what we can export. <sep><sep> When in LALIT, we are thinking, "What strategy will we use to face these new difficulties that the systemic crisis is bringing to the family?", we find that there are some demands that are truly pressing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For Air Mauritius, not only is the number of passengers decreasing, but there is an additional deficit of 4 billion. <sep><sep> What the trade union movement is going through, it is going through a crisis that everyone is going through. <sep><sep> Today, there are about 6,000 workers in the Security Industry, compared to 50,000 in the 80s. <sep><sep> When compared to 1990, we have come to the conclusion that, if we believe in internationalism and actually believe in it, we need to take our own responsibility to build that internationalism, to make it practical. <sep><sep> We find in the Movement for Family Liberation a dimension of our struggle against the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Explanations are found rather in the fact that there has been a single series of three very extensive challenges, but not victories, against capitalism. <sep><sep> Mauritius, this "historical bloc" (historical, because it lasts, it is not just a political mandate, for example) has been shattered, in another form, giving rise to the Labour Party. <sep><sep> Furthermore, we have publications (books) aimed at individuals who want to deepen their understanding of it. <sep><sep> The trade union movement has developed a bureaucracy that does not provide democratic control over the workers. <sep><sep> If, Yves, 2 years ago, anyone had said to us, "You know, young people will take to the streets in North Africa," we might have said, "Where is that?" and not listened to them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The sardines have been surrounded by 3 guards, and 4 others have been found to be following them closely. <sep><sep> One by one, each family that has worked in several sectors during their working lives has been warned and analyzed how it was to work in each workplace where they have already worked in their lives: <sep><sep> Another example of an international workers' organization is the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was created in 1905 in Chicago, America. <sep><sep> So, the SSR Labour Party together with the PMSD Gaetan Duval voted for a law to break workers and unions in 1973, now the Labour Party Navin Ramgoolam and PMXD Xavier Duval are replacing this law with a new one that is even more in the interest of employers. <sep><sep> It is in this context that we are proposing a reflection on an alternative economic policy that will create enough jobs and make us less vulnerable to the hardships of capitalist globalization. <sep><sep> This also doesn't look like our program, where all points form a whole that is moving towards a socialist society. <sep><sep> It always shows the same direction, even if giving you satisfaction on a demand, it does not mean that the global interest as a class has been preserved and safeguarded. <sep><sep> There are groups of electricians, carpenters where they work, while there are groups of all types of workers in a company, all kinds of workers. <sep><sep> - 'There is not enough prayer being done, that's why' Siram added. <sep><sep> This was announced in Parliament by former Health Minister Jeetah, in his speech on labor. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, to promote increased production of vegetables for export, the government has not made any proposals. <sep><sep> Furthermore, it is more difficult for workers in SMEs to organize and defend their interests. <sep><sep> The Fet Lalit festival was unconventional: the typical Fet Lalit event, with Alain Ah-Vee, who also co-hosted the event with Cindy Clelie, played a tune on his harmonica before he began hosting. <sep><sep> On the other hand, he was not as comfortable using his mother tongue to express himself. <sep><sep> Jamouna quickly understood that there was another woman in his life. <sep><sep> After the Prime Minister has been sworn in, he immediately returns to Parliament, proposing his entire cabinet to be chosen by Parliament in one bloc or rejected in one bloc. <sep><sep> Then there's the NTUC, representing a certain line of thought. <sep><sep> Individuals residing in Electoral Constituency Number 3 have the right to have a replacement Member of Parliament, as well as Siddick Chady having resigned. <sep><sep> Lelandime, meaning Sunday, the Speaker (whose real name was also Samazeste) organized a spectacular evening. <sep><sep> Médine, for example, has been completely destroyed, and others will follow suit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A group visited a place that was not allowed to attend the 5-day UT course, and others who registered after that. <sep><sep> Then the Supreme Court gave Valayden a warning that he cannot be Minister of Women's Rights. <sep><sep> Another problem, which is with him, is that the Zini State has an external debt. <sep><sep> Since independence, historical bourgeoisie has forced/agreed to cede some land to the state bourgeoisie, but certain bourgeoisie sections, they are always in rivalry, especially in this systemic crisis context. <sep><sep> For a serious Minister to introduce Creole as a medium, he must announce media preparation immediately in school manuals, at least for the First, he must start leading a basic training for teachers, at least those teaching the First. <sep><sep> Mrs. Lemer knew that now it would be easier for her because her party would control the state well despite Dinesh, who would never let him down, he told her that he should be careful because a disease which goes against him would tire him quickly and that it would last longer than others. <sep><sep> A boss in Israel preferred to employ a worker from Asia for Rs 300 for a day's work over a Palestinian worker who was asking him Rs 900. <sep><sep> There was a rush for girls who wanted to study Languages and Literature, Home Economics, Business Studies, Nursing, Pedagogy but Ganga decided to study Paleontology. <sep><sep> They found that there is a lack of politicization of this concept in South Africa. <sep><sep> And then there is a recovery by the big bourgeoisie, that is, the Oligarchs manage to recover more elements that were part of the Liberal Action, politically recovering them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you want to cry, cry; if you want to run away, run away; if you want to misbehave, misbehave. <sep><sep> They have so much covered what has happened that it seems almost 'impossible' for the truth to emerge. <sep><sep> In the market, with a bombardment of publicity, people think they are being offered all that is possible either in the form of restrictions on the one hand or by being made to believe in the benefits of multinational private companies on the other. <sep><sep> Read the article by Ashok Subron (page 85) on sabotaging the extraordinary project "Indian Ocean Zone of Peace". <sep><sep> He announced that Central Committee member of Lalit, Alain Ah-Vee was at the moment at the Freedom March (March of Liberty) in Palestine. <sep><sep> So, for quite some time now, there has been an emphasis on this fundamental principle of universal rights being used in the welfare of the state. <sep><sep> He concluded that LALIT is the only political party which has consistently advocated the introduction of Creole as a medium for a long time. <sep><sep> And the fact that using that 1972 Census for a Ridiculous Joke. <sep><sep> Split, fragmentation, trade unionism broken in 2, federation broken in two, confederation broken in 2. <sep><sep> It's a verse that says that in the end, you will have an alternative, it's not necessary to have a revolution to bring socialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But there was indeed something that was resisting the capture mentality. <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee said that Lalit has taken this crisis seriously since it threatens. <sep> <sep> It appears that there is collaboration between India, Sri Lanka, and Israel, to develop arms and carry out nuclear tests in the Indian Ocean region. <sep> <sep> He said he was furious about what he found and what he experienced there. <sep> <sep> So, we embody and share the same program and orientation and we. <sep> <sep> He announced that the government will subsidize, through a tax dedication, private education. <sep> <sep> elsewhere nurture different communal groupings around; elsewhere they are implementing "faithful laws", where there will no longer be only one law for everyone? <sep> <sep> Elementary things, they didn't have rights until the '60s, in a modern country like America? And yet according to all international laws, these rights were already guaranteed, America says it respects international laws. <sep> <sep> Germany, Denmark, USA, Spain, France, UK, Laos in a first time. <sep> <sep> The result, represents a very severe warning for MSM-MMM. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A spokesperson for the Israeli army, Amital Leibovitch, has indeed justified this action on the international stage because, according to her, "Israel has the right to defend itself". <sep><sep> A peaceful demonstration, with no violence towards anyone, is taking place on Royal Road with signs. <sep><sep> This example is also a direct political attack where the State is gradually dissociating itself from its political responsibility through privatization. <sep><sep> A delegation from LALIT attended a meeting with this international coordination against military bases that were present in Mumbai, during the World Social Forum where, simultaneously, the Global Movement Against War was meeting to establish this anti-military base coordination. <sep><sep> Therefore, as far as Lalit is concerned, it is, in part, the result of active participation by many families. <sep><sep> They are on four fronts: spelling, grammar, rhetoric, training. <sep><sep> The campaign, remember, began before the elections, during our campaign, in public meetings, on Lalit's political program on MBC. <sep><sep> Now, with the new Employment Relations Bill and Employment Rights Bill also talking about what the press is calling an "unemployment benefit", even if it is not. <sep><sep> So it seems there is no real political will for the Minister and the Government of the Social Alliance to tackle the issue of the Chagos. <sep><sep> In this sector, we have a working group in LALIT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Reform Obeegadoo building already had 2 floors. <sep><sep> We want a comprehensive democracy without any communal divisions. <sep><sep> However, all the sub-committees in the Academy have submitted very interesting interim reports. <sep><sep> Is there a different punishment for a report that controls the country at different times? <sep><sep> More than 3 strikes must call the police to make arrests. <sep><sep> I believe that if you have an ideology, you also have propaganda, which influences people in a certain direction, to the detriment of a balance, people's minds will be influenced. <sep><sep> Is there any support for the resistance and struggle that is taking place in Palestine today? <sep><sep> And it was convincing after this meeting that village elections should not be abolished. <sep><sep> When we recall this beginning, today when we look at the Med Point scandal, it is not surprising. <sep><sep> General strikes by all workers in a country, or even in a large region, from all sectors, all types of work, are on strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The IRS, like the previous government, has been accused of creating ghettos, tourist enclaves where tourists are encouraged to come and spend around Rs15 million on camping trips. <sep>
They are angry because they are giving 5 lakh rupees to other private companies, threatening to put all out-of-control operators on buses, shutting down all factories, privatizing repair work, and licensing CNT mechanics. <sep>
When the conference was over, and after the president said they had no questions, Ram Seegobin asked the president if they knew why the press, in general, did not matter. <sep>
Ratify it, and then go 'cut it on the Prime Minister's order'. <sep>
Because of the economic crisis, the bourgeoisie is more dependent on the state than before, so it is more curved than usual. <sep>
Robert Phillipson, the 'talk-of-the-town' researcher, seems to regard those backroom anti-mother tongue arguments as rampant. <sep>
The mobilization took place over a long period of time, well before the fateful date of 2000 when 40% of shares were finally sold to France Telecom. <sep>
We say that in the framework in which it operated, it was rather narrow, because we, in LALIT, find that it does not address the question of deepening democracy seriously. <sep>
Three boys came before another and then two girls followed. <sep>
For example, when talking about maternity leave, protective equipment, legislation, boots, paid travel, all these were unheard of at certain times, they had no rights, the union promoted, mobilized, and won it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But the law also comes out in the practice of social norms, what we call customs. <sep><sep> There are politicians who believe that there is a beginning of a mobilization based on communal reflexes, sitting for electricity. <sep><sep> LALIT is also campaigning to put an end to the ban on mother tongue in Parliament, where the Association of Registrars for minutes, and in the Supreme Court. <sep><sep> Religion is a form of "alienation" in the sense that in religions, they find a link between men and God, where man, people. <sep><sep> At the launch of books on PT tribune, Guy Rozemont, and the book by Jayen Cuttaree  Behind the Purple Curtain , Paul Berenger and Navin Ramgoolam praised their comrades. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, when people raise their eyes to see if there is a nest in the sky, they see a pot full of electric blue. <sep><sep> So, the crisis we are going through is a crisis that affects all sectors. <sep><sep> Now, there is no education only in schools, colleges, and universities in Venezuela. <sep><sep> There is a company IRS that needs to sell only land on the local market. <sep><sep> When we see internationalist solidarity in Mauritius, the central aspect of it is the role that the working class must play as a vanguard class in the struggle against imperialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And a request for there to be a table set up where we can eat and discuss, it can be further back, it can be further back because we are getting a place to talk among friends in work. <sep> When the colony was established, the colonists uprooted many trees. <sep> Additionally, the newspapers which were filled with news on repression against the community movement were changing their priorities. <sep> The University of Mauritius recommends the use of harmonic grammar to be flexible on variations in writing styles. <sep> Today after the deviation of MMM in favor of the bourgeoisie, LALIT continues the struggle of this abandoned class by MMM. <sep> And what we will witness today evening is "Who is that powerful woman?" and "Who is controlling that man?" <sep> The government's policy is to separate the camps with people of different races in Mauritius, selling it to even richer people from abroad. <sep> Accompanied by her lawyer, Rex Stephen, Mrs. Topize stated that, when her husband went to give a deposition at Central Barracks, he was fine and had no injuries on him. <sep> Our vertebral column campaign distributed 20,000 leaflets in all constituencies. <sep> (i) Ecology: We see that “the economy”, from a non-Marxist point of view, is something that firstly connects society with nature. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is not just a matter of meeting the various demands that satisfy different social groups, such as teachers, nurses, and others. <sep><sep> It is not just about choosing between two individuals from the same Jugnauth family dynasty, but rather between the uncle, who is accused of electoral fraud, and the nephew who participated in the elaboration of that very fraud. <sep><sep> And on top of that, there is talk of creating a new agreement where it is likely that a family member has already entered into a rear deal (albeit disguised for now). <sep><sep> There is also the experience of LALIT de KLAS activists working together with sugar industry workers in SILU-UASI between 1979 and 1983. <sep><sep> All these political crises cannot be seen separately from economic crises. <sep><sep> The textile bourgeoisie in England was pressuring the government to take a pro-confederate stance in America, enslavement. <sep><sep> In 1992, PMSD supporters attacked 3 LALIT activists who were demonstrating. <sep><sep> We salute the courage and contribution of all organizations that formed part of the WTO Protest Platform, which took place on the 10th of September. <sep><sep> We found their policies lacking in various aspects, not just economically, but also in combating addiction problems, drug trafficking, closing down the Diego Garcia base, etc. <sep><sep> Their main goal is to guarantee the protection of private investments in various countries. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Where renewable energy is concerned, there is also less strategy than before. <sep><sep> In LALIT when we talk politics, we are talking about a classless politics, and classless here we are talking about social class. <sep><sep> The program that LALIT has been developing for the past 3-4 years, and that, together with all those who have contributed their ideas in the 150 or so meetings we have held. <sep><sep> But because the bestloser system is still in place, the Electoral Commission still needs to look back at the 1972 census to calculate bestlosers. <sep><sep> The funny thing is that Minister Bunwaree has made no comments on the Findings of the International Hearing on Education for Workers on this issue. <sep><sep> The systemic crisis touches on a “political” space, that is a political space like a national state, it is in this country. <sep><sep> On the issue of demands, the Court of Human Rights provides satisfaction. <sep><sep> Sympathy for the victims and disgust for the criminals who were protected by political power was raised by a population that was sleeping in indifference. <sep><sep> and things that are not necessarily pleasant and only happen (the lark has a bad character even if it sings and flies beautifully, it also gets a rather harsh treatment even if it is not doing any harm in the garden, etc.) <sep><sep> Our group, 3 women (35-50 years old) and 2 uncles (60 years old) and 2 donkeys were on the roadside. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There were chapatis with whole wheat flour for his uncle; vegetarian food for Kamla and Celimène; rice, fish curry, sakaymanga and apple pie. <sep><sep> Workers are in various types of work such as contractual work, part-time work, odd jobs, temporary work, seasonal work, daily labor. <sep><sep> Since the evening when Princess Prathna first made contact with them, the twelve dialogues and the princess were meeting quite often. <sep><sep> The fisherman, industrial lobsters for young people who are leaving school as well as for graduates of sugar, textile and the local industry. <sep><sep> This is what makes the difference between a transitional program that we advocate for - a reformist program even if it is maximalist. <sep><sep> Trazektwar do most of of largely of the interests of class it represents. <sep><sep> Similarly, the capitalist system that has settled in almost all corners of the globe, even in countries that until a certain time were left outside, like the ex-Soviet Union, Europe East, China. <sep><sep> There's Rishy Bukoree, Roland Tsang, Sedley Assonne, Clifford Vellien, Sanjana Bagmal, Sunil Gopal, Habib Mosaheb, Dan Callikhan. <sep><sep> He went and trained another strong union or another federation. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we must be able to remain hopeful. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With 99% of the genes in GMO crops that they produce also producing their insecticides and herbicides that only go with this kind of crop, so they sell more of these poisons too. <sep> <sep> When they install, then they come to say: "Abe, why does the University of Mauritius have a subsidy and we don't?" It's only later that it becomes clear that it's illegal according to the WTO to give a company a subsidy and not give others. <sep> <sep> And the government has released Rs45 million for Sun Trust, once again, a trust of the Jugnauth family. <sep> <sep> Shift the money from profit protection in the fields to food production: <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen said that faced with the crisis, we have to look for content production. <sep> <sep> She was on TOP FM on February 16, May 10, and June 14. <sep> <sep> These sizes took care of the first peace agreement in newspapers and television. <sep> <sep> Navin Ramgoolam can say, "I will make a New Constitution," or "I will make a 2nd Republic," as if he has already distributed this in his Party, or Government. <sep> <sep> In public transport in recent 1-2 weeks, there has been a 15% +2+2% salary increase. <sep> <sep> This new government is becoming editor of the IRS, where there will be IRS that will offer all kinds of different forms of residence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who was presiding over the launch of the Education for Workers, thanked the individuals who participated in this project: Marusia for the paper, Patrice for the layout. <sep><sep> The reason is evident: there is a growing social inequality, and we have not yet built a mass political movement - to tackle this problem together. <sep><sep> They call it the "cost of separation" when a worker loses their job, losing their means to support their family. <sep><sep> If the Establishment itself does not want to do this, infrastructure should be made available for workers to roll out agro-industrial cooperatives. <sep><sep> So when Navin Ramgoolam applies this same Workers' policy to encourage the development of a state bourgeoisie, he already has in front of him a historical bourgeoisie that is much more organized and much stronger. <sep><sep> He needed to eat at the canteens where he and his mother were eating in the fields. <sep><sep> In the case of "justified dismissal", according to Bil-la, you will get money that seems more than a "severance allowance", but if you refuse the work offered by those people, it will be cut. <sep><sep> Before Cyclone hit, Disid called it "Agalega" before the displacement towards Lil 25. <sep><sep> So it is a contradiction, where we can find a way out of today's problem, we know we need a political struggle, but this is the strict one, the so-called political parties. <sep><sep> It was only the defenders of the Workers' Party who were getting into this interlude to make rubber plantations, dams, corn, a series of plantations that were making alepok. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The state of affairs is such that every day there is conflict, and instead of bringing "peace and harmony" in society. <sep><sep> We are publishing the paper that Rajni Lallah presented at the LALIT Seminar, on 2 February. <sep><sep> In his speech, Navin Ramgoolam talks about the benefits of renewable energy production through IPPs. <sep><sep> It is prudent that we anticipate opposition movements, in principle. <sep><sep> This will lead to a systemic crisis. The "historical block" is under threat. <sep><sep> For the plantation owners, it is easy because they have an advanced system at the root of their olive tree. <sep><sep> The press has also noticed that after the resignation of Ashok Subron, he is being described as a union leader. <sep><sep> We call on the bourgeois political parties because they represent the bourgeoisie's interests, one way or another. <sep><sep> We remind you that there are 5 ministerial positions that Navin Ramgoolam chose to leave vacant when forming his government. <sep><sep> They're coming back later with food problems. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have understood his anatomy, his tendency to laugh at most things makes him a disorderly person. <sep><sep> The report also criticizes the way this definition tends to consider a culture as "ethnolized" in a traditionalist and elitist way. <sep><sep> In 2002 he resigned, when the MMM-MSM government, under pressure from the United States, passed the anti-terrorism law (PoTA). <sep><sep> Since the Lalzeri government entered into an alliance with the Bush government against the Islamists after 9/11, the Zini State has been involved in destabilization in Mali. <sep><sep> It is worthwhile to mention that when we talk today, we are in a period where there is only general resistance against this economic system. <sep><sep> The PT-PMSD Budget notes that the global economy is in a very serious crisis, and that the situation may become even worse. <sep><sep> At the same time, the global financial system, still in the ICU, after its collapse, will take 2-3 years. <sep><sep> At the same time, the government has a policy to devalue the rupee, which leads to higher prices. <sep><sep> Here, in this integrated firm, they do not just look at profit on the market, but also at other issues. <sep><sep> They do not find relief in the L'Alliance pour la Justice campaign. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Berenger even believe that Bolom Ramgoolam has never done anything good on the Chagos issue. <sep> because he brought up the argument that France is a "green country" because they have a colony in the Indian Ocean! <sep><sep>This award is a recognition for our persistent and constant work in the use of mother languages in adult literacy. <sep><sep> G.Duval himself was recognized for his dedication as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 70s, he declared: “We have made Mauritius take its place among French-speaking countries, closely associating Mauritius with France” (Le Mauricien October 12, 1990). <sep><sep> It encourages the presence of state leaders in their leadership capacity in official ceremonies. <sep><sep> About 3 years later, Dr. Malhotra suffered a stroke and lost his speech. <sep><sep> There are conflicts that we are supposed to address, such as the environment, AIDS, which we are supposed to address at the national level. <sep><sep> This is how Mauritius can become a leader in food production that guarantees GMO-free crops. <sep><sep> He knows in his blood and in his mind that the dominant ideology is only enforced through the brutal force of a government. <sep><sep> That it's about Medpoint, the Ros-Nwar campaign, Jeetah, Betamax, Ramgoolam's passport, the Jugnauth family, etc. etc. etc. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The challenge of our generation is to see participation at the same time as ensuring a frame that will allow for the development of this region. <sep><sep> Carol Benson has said that she will talk about the experiences she has had in Africa and Latin America. <sep><sep> *Remove the section in the Law that allows the Ministry of Finance to put pressure to impose or increase property taxes, and to reduce grants from central regions. <sep><sep> It has shown us how logical it is according to this “set theory” the elementary elements that all children do in iron nowadays, sometimes secondly, where all citizens in their country are “Mauritian”. <sep><sep> However, Navin Ramgoolam has announced that he will hold elections after the general elections in Great Britain, that is, after the 6th of May. <sep><sep> He is taxing a "social flow", but in a way that is truly a burden that people will have to pay for. <sep><sep> The capital that the capitalist invests, it turns into a satellite, like a swallow. <sep><sep> RIOT does not know how to function if it has to chase after a family group. <sep><sep> He denounced the State led by Olmert which systematically and deliberately led to this massacre where 1,100 people were killed, a third of them children. <sep><sep> We have been experiencing a chill from head to toe. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In addition to selling, the craftsman maintains, Rima has sold a watch in Laventure! <sep><sep> Great Britain has cooked a little Lily since Seychelles, Chagos, and created a new flavor “State”, completely invented, called British Indian Ocean Territories, which strictly no one recognizes. <sep><sep> The second drawing shows a strict party structure, and the way branches like lungs of a party, while its Central Committee is fully involved in a centralized party Program. <sep><sep> There is nothing concrete in the program for the 2 blocks of the garment and textile industry crisis. <sep><sep> The great challenge that has emerged is that their discourse is politically oriented towards a moment in history. <sep><sep> The struggle against all forms of violence by State officials must continue. <sep><sep> This year, we have reflected a lot on how to develop our inter-union strategies, and on the possibility of developing an online newsletter. <sep><sep> In fact, Monsanto's grin is often a quality called "terminator", and it risks eliminating all the grins that the planters have been using for several years. <sep><sep> If there are many maids on the island who want to say more freedom and democracy at work, social security means losing their jobs. <sep><sep> On September 1st, Jack Bizlall and MPM and the collective will hold a demonstration in Rose Hill, while on September 2nd, RA and the Joint Negotiating Panel and GWF will hold another one in Port Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Dear: Let's take another round of comments, either on what has already been said, elements that still need a response, or to dig deeper into what Ram just said, or on the new size of the lie with our time. <sep><sep> It would have been better if we understood a little when we talk about class politics, which is exactly what we are talking about. <sep><sep> Because remember that capitalism has captured all the mother earth resources and has also expropriated part of our production, year after year. <sep><sep> This means that, whether it is an "upturn" or a "downturn", LALIT, as a party, it has its importance, but our strategy will naturally be different in different moments. <sep><sep> And the employer, he has his class struggle on his side, he also, the more organized in the Mauritius Employers' Federation, in the Joint Economic Council, he organizes it well. <sep><sep> And that money that Europe is giving in return for a reduction in the price of textiles, that money could have gone into the entire manufacturing industry. <sep><sep> And meanwhile, since when I was there in 2007, there has been an ongoing mobilization. <sep><sep> The boy used to call Devadass, but everyone used to call him Dass. <sep><sep> - Don't forget to prepare design for two people in my private salamander. <sep><sep> And the unions and federations have invited our members to speak on the crisis, too. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The newspaper puts articles on its web portal, without any editorial position being taken. <sep> <sep> Present at Lalit: Rada Kistnasamy, Rajni Lallah, Ally Hossenbokus, Ram Seegobin, Cindy Clélie, André Pierre, Alain Ah Vee, Jerry Cadine. <sep> <sep> Translation, terminology and history, all have committees working on it. <sep> <sep> The Soviet/ European Union, which used to abstain, voted in favor of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. <sep> <sep> In 2000, Ariel Sharon, the Opposition Leader at the time, visited Temple of the Mount. <sep> <sep> If the Minister comes, we will continue with the Forum with 2 speakers, and more time for people in the audience to intervene, otherwise we will have a round table. <sep> <sep> For the first time, a union leader began to understand the differences between transitional demands that LALIT has developed and demands in the style of 'lalis commission'. <sep> <sep> They were accepting their fate for a mouthful of food. <sep> <sep> What the unions are answering to is that a union is not an individual gathering, a union is not that. <sep> <sep> Every vote for LALIT means another possible world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he tells the story of the 1971 strike, he always says, "That was in the time when we were young." <sep><sep> A conflict commanded by the Treasure of the Falklands Islands, while the Argentines were claiming another one, involving us, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). <sep><sep> What is happening today in the economy has already been predicted in a measure by Marx and Engels. <sep><sep> Berenger has made a whirlwind tour: London, France, USA, and Mozambique, with his usual speech and advice on "land of opportunities". <sep><sep> And in Europe and in ACP, for example, with a quantity of sugar produced equal to what it will consume, so that there is no surplus. <sep><sep> They are interested in him like all the other young people in music, fashion, actors, actresses, and chatting on the Internet. <sep><sep> The fundamental principle must be there, when there is a class of workers like in '79. <sep><sep> Everybody was saying how happy he was with his family. <sep><sep> Meaning you can place it in a global context, in a social context, in a political and economic context. <sep><sep> Similarly, the boss has maintained a monopoly on what he calls "mining". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, all decisions, it will still be the boss who makes them. <sep> <sep> On the occasion of his birthday, for the first time in a long time, Timi and Balram managed to gather all their children around them. <sep> <sep> There is work in the branches, in the member assembly like today, in the central committee. <sep> <sep> There were also many debates on several issues at the same time, the cooperative had become a means for certain people to access capital, and serving the cooperative as a foothold for their ascent in capitalist classes. <sep> <sep> In this process, the program was born. <sep> <sep> Timi turned to Dinesh to have a special fund to help the farmers in his region. <sep> <sep> And in the Road Map, Arvind Boolell says that for this debt, we need to look for "creative solutions". <sep> <sep> Today all these countries have integrated this capitalist economic system. <sep> <sep> Are you going to the police or not? Aunt Alice doesn't trust the police. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the official delegation entered, a motionless figure - where laughter lines and scars were cleverly mixed to say "Chou! You didn't get me!" - stared at them blankly. <sep>
<sep> No one, that is, except for 2 negotiators, Kader Bhayat and Jean Claude Bibi, they were entitled to come and go, because they were negotiating. <sep>
<sep> The book was also on the security industry today and the exaggerated support that the State has given it since every year, when the State has neglected other forms of agriculture and agro-industry. <sep>
<sep> And there was also a newspaper called Nuvo Lizur, which Jack Bizlall and Eshan Khodabux had started. <sep>
<sep> This is how it all comes together; a complete package; like when you become a princess or a queen, you get that title; it's an official function in the English State until today. <sep>
<sep> But he had forgotten in his furious anger that in the country of Yapanama they prayed to the god Yapana-Ma, Mama lesiel and the earth, represented by a lady in a vanwidfami dress. <sep>
<sep> Not all of us in the same boat, without any cuts, we are totally independent, even outside of work. <sep>
<sep> This is worrisome because a law cannot have a natural death. <sep>
<sep> It seems there are some gentlemen and also some other gentlemanly fellows who have left their families and children in Palestine to go work in Jordan and in other countries abroad in order to survive. <sep>
<sep> How can we prevent the US imperialists from using Diego as a military base to bomb other peoples, not just "collateral injuries and deaths" but real civilians, as they have done in Iraq and Afghanistan and Pakistan? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> * All actions illegal during the first 5 months after the deadlock in negotiations. <sep><sep> So we found that this has diverted attention from the celebrations that we were having in court, during 30 years in a non-sectarian way. <sep><sep> Also, the International Committee of the Red Cross is worried today about the occupation by the Israeli Government in Palestine. <sep><sep> The American military empire is going towards where it will hide in the mud. <sep><sep> * The social responsibility of family to reproduce humanity. <sep><sep> Risks have been taken from a reservoir, which will then enter the bloodstream. <sep><sep> In this context today there are members and sympathizers of LALIT, and there are also many people who have shown interest in the work that LALIT does and who have not necessarily already participated in many activities of LALIT. <sep><sep> It is worth noting that some groups that claim their rights, draw almost all their publications in French. <sep><sep> What that means is that if a new sector, as they say a book had 100 pages, it has 120 pages. <sep><sep> Introduction of the MPL, will also lead to a balkanization of the law. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Until the '70s, there were many conflicts between East Pakistan (which also included East Bengal) and West Pakistan. <sep><sep> In the Mauritius Times, it is mentioned in the Workers section. <sep><sep> However, these Manifestos online (where they operate), as well as in the real lives of people on the ground (true sources and Manifesto destinations), they are on paper. <sep><sep> It is a film that is both a great leap in art and an interpretation of the life of Frida Kahlo (1907-54) and her husband, Diego Rivera, who was 20 years older than her. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie in the textile sector in England was putting pressure on their government to take a position in favor of the confederates in America, the slaves. <sep><sep> They raise the commotion at a communal level where workers can turn against them. <sep><sep> "Preferring girls to boys! His third son was not like all the other sons. <sep><sep> In every country in the world that is introducing mother tongues, it expects the same conversation. <sep><sep> After dinner, he asked his family to listen to him. <sep><sep> And especially when an Indian Sunday movie starts, when the movie Indian Sunday ends, they don't go to sleep, they go straight to the car, they choose their spot, they line up their tires before the others arrive in the car, between midnight and three in the morning, they work in secret. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, when Bryan raised the issue of religion, it is important, because when we fight communalism, if you say that we should put an end to all communalist matters (it is good, really necessary). <sep><sep> *Resist all propaganda by multinational companies and local private sectors as they are promoting GMOs to potentially decrease suffering in the world. <sep><sep> It has been announced that more than Rs 1 billion has been spent on tourism. <sep><sep> Because finally, this Groupe Advance, because its base of planters has become a force that was well represented at the rural level, it needed, for its stability, an alliance with a group of people who were much more urban dwellers than usual in the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Tactical problem on the part of the PTr Besides all this, Ramgoolam has to face which political strategy to adopt on the Med Point issue, on the new case of fraud in real estate transactions that could involve one of his Ministers. <sep><sep> What would I be without you? - Different but always special. <sep><sep> MAC regrouped more than fifty organizations and individuals in a period when communalism was resurging. <sep><sep> We believe that we are also in Mauritius, we have our word to say on the injustices that the Palestinian people are suffering- and in solidarity with this people, 2 comrades from Lalit went there. <sep><sep> LALIT condemns the Government for repression against the filmmakers of the film "Paradise in Day" and the members of the "Anti-Drug Movement" who organized cinema sessions to raise awareness of the seriousness of the drug problem in the country. <sep><sep> The PT and the MMM, they too, they have survived, they are still here because they have swum in a social wave. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Unity of class, unity of working class, doesn't mean there should be only one political party. <sep><sep> Normally, we already have a woman who is running for the election, so WIN and WIP organize a mansion for her, built on the shore. <sep><sep> It won't be easy for the working class to go through this noisy confusion. <sep><sep> But we understand what has happened, and we will find ourselves between two systems, even now. <sep><sep> Profit! Dividend! Behind all that, Uncle Ralph who holds power. <sep><sep> The mirror, separate Aamer and his family from their olive plantation and their village. <sep><sep> We found where they came from, their respective trajectories, and we found where they are today. <sep><sep> there would be a multinational invasion as there has never been; there would be an acceleration of social rights (under the GATS), and at the same time this would perpetuate and accentuate the commercial imbalance between the rich countries. <sep><sep> When we talk about decriminalizing prostitution, what we mean is that we are saying, we are saying that prostitution is not something that concerns the police, it is not something that concerns the courts. <sep><sep> Then it creates problems for the Offshore sector here. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even if they announce that children should not sit the CPE because of language politics, even if they say before legalizing abortion a referendum should be held, even if they provoke divisions within trade unions and federations. <sep><sep> Then we see another class, a type here, a type there, intermediate class between these two fundamental classes: <sep><sep> We also wanted agricultural and agro-industrial diversification towards essential production, not marginal products (such as anthurium) for export. <sep><sep> But, and this is important, it's not just about pretending. <sep><sep> Today, does the bourgeoisie also want strong leadership? <sep><sep> According to his lawyer, Mr. Kamal Sabbagh, who defended him when he was brought before the Jalameh Military Court in occupied territory on February 21, his client was subjected to torture during his interrogation. <sep><sep> For example, a demand for a wage increase, is it reasonable, and it puts pressure on the employer and the government. <sep><sep> Masses began to gather once a month, then once a week, later it became a Saturday-Sunday affair. <sep><sep> This challenge, in terms of economic leadership, led the State to ensure job creation for all citizens. <sep><sep> And because it was not a Gandhi-like hunger strike, there was no time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The date was chosen, the first of May, as it coincides with a celebration almost ubiquitous in the world. <sep> <sep> And on arriving by boat, unfortunately, it's becoming clearer. <sep> <sep> Then make a cover, layno print, an iron stamp and an eraser to help with the numbering. <sep> <sep> He left his family in his reflection, went into his room. <sep> <sep> and he left a second to allow him, when he closes it, to remember us so that, when he leaves, he doesn't even remember this delicacy. <sep> <sep> Sometimes there may be organic links between trade unions and political parties. <sep> <sep> MSM-MMM have made efforts in introducing the mother tongue in schools. <sep> <sep> The Government needs to stop giving permits to encourage the establishment of malls. <sep> <sep> It's true that consumers were getting all kinds of merchandise cheaply on the sidewalks but the circulation was becoming extremely difficult, security was impossible because pickpockets, thieves (robbers) were causing uproar. <sep> <sep> Obviously, they want, before they get into the production of invest or invest in Ethanol, they get a guaranteed market and a guaranteed price. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When workers are told that we need to protect our rights here, Ramgoolam said that Mauritius has already lost all these rights. <sep><sep> But, this kind of "erosion kit zone", can create an explosion Eros like a device. <sep><sep> All of the 5 houses are located in places where there is a possibility to expand the backyard. <sep><sep> Because this is where you will find different ways to bring the bed further forward. <sep><sep> People were waiting for his arrival with impatience. <sep><sep> Drivers, controllers, mechanics in all transport companies need a unified union organization that can reflect on general problems, more than one union that can't even have a common strategy for promoting wage increases for all transport workers. <sep><sep> We have refused, for example, to go on the radio or TV too much, and to refuse commands in the press. <sep><sep> Police because it has no clear program when it is engaging with it, gathers people sitting next to it. <sep><sep> Now with TUTF, bureaucracy has another source of income, independent from workers, not under workers' control at all. <sep><sep> So, the European Union strategy, and the European Union itself, are clearly reducing production. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It's a sign that the industrial relationship has deteriorated significantly. <sep><sep> Small businesses like this one only survive because they want to survive. <sep><sep> Instead of just being colleagues at work, collaborating with a partner to make life on the site better collectively, it becomes a place where a colleague sees you as a potential ally. <sep><sep> In a statement to LALIT Review, John mentioned using the "floral induction" method on plants, so that a report can be obtained every few years. <sep><sep> They think it's necessary to start an operation to remedy the situation. <sep><sep> Dr Dodlo also expressed it for Mauritius. <sep><sep> When we will face Bidze who will be coming in exactly a week [this speech was made just before the 2013 election], that's what we need to keep an eye on. <sep><sep> There are those coming from Australia, Laoland, Great Britain, and Kenya, as well as from Mauritius (see the list below). <sep><sep> The general shift of all these sanctions implies that the relative emancipation of women through more economic independence and peace from working together will be a concern. <sep><sep> However, due to being in a "faulty country", all agencies that conduct "credit ratings", such as Standards and Poors, Blumberg, etc., to give it a "Less Reliable" status as an entity that can be reimbursed for losses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, a large group of detainees was supposed to be presented in Rose Belle on paper by Ram Seegobin, Jean Claude Bibi, and our guest from South Africa, Oupa Lehulere. The newspaper, after all, has concentrated a lot on union work: the rabbit, the security industry, the reconstruction of the same things that MMM had already done better 30 years ago. <sep><sep> And when he and other workers were imprisoned because of a strike, they explained the strike to the prisoners in Bo Basin. <sep><sep> Therefore, the demands of LALIT are not just a few slogans like the slogans of the commission to buy groceries that concern ecology in a vacuum, but it looks at ecology as a whole together with the economy itself. <sep><sep> If you do not study society, you will not be able to act well. <sep><sep> Other capitalists will not act in our interest, but in theirs. <sep><sep> It is the current MMM-MSM government that has accelerated the entire process: rapid mechanization for plantations and harvesting of sugarcane that has led to the VRS, where almost 10,000 sugar workers have been displaced. <sep><sep> In this sense, it becomes part of the State in its broadest sense. <sep><sep> on violence by State Officials (Protocol that JUSTICE serves as the front-line Program), on the Declaration of Grande Riviere on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> In the past, it is often the family members who are victims of violence who are often blamed by society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Uncle, do you think they know we're here? - I don't think so, but they might find out. <sep><sep> During the counting, candidates and their supporters may realize that the boat is well balanced and find every action being taken for counting. <sep><sep> They have convinced those in favor of keeping BLS and Zidisye, but at the same time, they have been hesitant in the press for 7 years, to suggest that they are making progress, one after the other, launching a direct bold attack against BLS. <sep><sep> But it cannot defend the institution because it electorally swapped for class reasons. <sep><sep> To know what we need to do, they should answer the following questions: <sep><sep> It even threatens to resign when Bheenick was appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank (Feb 07), because he wanted to appoint his own people as the Governor of the Bank, which will continue to provoke the rupee depreciation. <sep><sep> During the 5 years of the Labour Government, there was a policy where the beach was attacked. <sep><sep> In April 2008, more than a year later, when the financial crisis began to worsen the global economic crisis. <sep><sep> The campaign was so strong that even after the elections, during the counting, and even afterwards, the propaganda continued. <sep><sep> The boss is preparing a process, he is proposing his own committee, if the process is approved, then he will finance it himself. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then she tends to rally not only her own strength, but also the political strength of other classes that she can use to march alongside her. <sep><sep>Alain Ah-Vee began his speech by saying that today in the newspapers, when you read them, you may be discouraged by the confusion prevailing in political discussions, on one side, and by the low level of debates on the other side. <sep><sep>Driver give them his home phone number and ask them to Check and in no way will he be busying his truck, he must stop by their house. <sep><sep>Another method of communication with workers and activists is through our website. <sep><sep>He also took care of her husband, her stepmother, her stepfather, her stepbrother, her stepsister just as before he was taking care of her father, her mother, her brother, her sister. <sep><sep>Additionally he had to stop cutting and selling wood during the dry season. <sep><sep>But, the working class, as soon as it comes under this ideological influence, most people no longer see Berenger as a leader. <sep><sep>He has no control over any town, but he is positioning himself to regain power. <sep><sep>and on Independent Power Producers (IPP) that are producing and selling it to CEB, especially on a plant that operates in Lenor, Belle Vue Thermal Centre. <sep><sep>Yesterday, from 2.30pm at St Andrews, there was a panel discussion on Zen and Politics organized by Amnesty International (Mauritian section). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So have you also already participated in the production of the show. <sep> <sep> Long ago when he used to stroll on the road of Bonnvenn, for him it was a road like any other. <sep> <sep> Rada Kistnasamy has been delegated by the Education for Workers, and is following the course, and also providing assistance in the course, while those with successful experience in maternal language education. <sep> <sep> However, Kaya was in good health when he stopped and closed Alcatraz. <sep> <sep> Many young soldiers are deserting the army, hiding in the forest. <sep> <sep> These are generalized problems that we are describing, they require a unified union organization that can analyze and propose a global strategy so that transport workers do not break the law and face the penalties that are coming quickly. <sep> <sep> One day when he was meditating, he heard a prophetic voice that revealed an oracle: "Bandoukland will enter its Bomatom Bharat phase, its Kalyoug, until a girl, a miracle child, will come to face the future and allow the region of the sun to pass through the screen of poisonous gases." Sadou smiled, took his staff, and headed towards the rising sun where he was told he would find the miracle child. <sep> <sep> In a history book I read, a king used to kill all children to prevent the spreading of rebellion against his rule. <sep> <sep> 1 - Minister Cuttaree has a duty to clearly explain the position he has defended in the WTO. <sep> <sep> He is also a member of other organizations such as Education for Workers where he is a legislator, in the Housing Movement (a movement that deals with housing issues). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have conducted x, y, z to introduce the Kreol language into schools. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Ramgoolam, new Leader of the Opposition Berenger, representing MSM Nando Bodha were present. Rajni Lallah presented the message of LALIT. <sep><sep> It is a manifesto specifically against the Zini government like imperialist powers. <sep><sep> There's a current in the lagoon, an anarchist current that says the state must be abolished immediately. <sep><sep> MMM was challenging the Labour Party, but we criticized their way of presenting the challenge. <sep><sep> Many workers have lost their jobs, with 50,000 employees in construction and tourism becoming 5,000. <sep><sep> We are pleased to present a transcript of an interview with Jean-Claude Bibi on "Zenez and Trazektwar Workers and MMM, 2 Political Parties in the Working Class". <sep><sep> There was no room for us sympathizers. <sep><sep> However, ERB Bunwaree, PS Minister of Labour, encourages there to be a 'settlement'. <sep><sep> We are constantly pressuring the government and employers not to collude and devalue the currency, in order to get super-profits as we have seen in the hotel sector in recent years. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In our reflection on the state of the labor movement, our concern is to find ways to make union movements question the capitalist system. 

<sep> However, today the Chagos Refugee Group and the Chagossian Social Committee come together, risking a lot when they separate their struggle from the struggle for a solid base and the struggle for decolonization and re-unification. 

<sep> Small landowners are also struggling for the same reasons as large landowners, and they too depend on the state bourgeoisie. 

<sep> He is saying that the Workers' Party has never been against loosening the system. 

<sep> Today there is this concept of "civil society" which abstracts all notions of class, a concept that includes bosses and religious NGOs. 

<sep> The World Bank in a report published in February 2010 describes how “the equal control in the WB is more sophisticated than ever, …. its capacity to affect the life of the Palestinian population, their freedom of movement more effectively. 

<sep> There is also the taxi fare at 2-4 times the normal fare for a single trip, depending on the route.

<sep> Also present were Dany Marie, Alain Ah-Vee, and Ram Seegobin, among other party members.

<sep> As it remains on paper, how it is classified, and also on how we can make it digital.

<sep> When the alarm was raised to confiscate mobile phones, the prisoners began a revolt. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I woke up and saw your message early in the morning! <sep><sep> Is it possible to negotiate when Israel does not recognize the Palestinian border, a border that is internationally accepted? <sep><sep> This means that for everyone, they are dealing with individual capitalist power. <sep><sep> There is a series of incentives in place to invest from abroad. <sep><sep> Different parties within the government or opposition in Parliament, all their politics have moved toward the capitalist economic system. <sep><sep> Deputies may question the way the public sector is administered. <sep><sep> Then they return to the details of the Court between the CEB and the electricity production and distribution establishments. <sep><sep> This is precisely and clearly because Blair cannot agree on sovereignty as there is a military base there. <sep><sep> Despite the fact that the Minister admitted that tourists from all over the world are visiting nearby destinations. <sep><sep> In other words, if we are to have a class policy, we need to understand the strictness of class society in its depths and in a coherent way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are meeting with activists at 19:00 today to coordinate actions against the demolition notices. <sep><sep> For the workers of St. Felix, their money is supposed to come from the SUDS. <sep><sep> The government, for example, is providing capital to businesses that are heading straight towards bankruptcy. <sep><sep> He used to read newspapers, dictionaries, magazines, books, encyclopedias, and had a curiosity to understand everything, a thirst for knowledge. <sep><sep> With the implementation of the neoliberal policies of MSM-MMM aiming to destroy the rights of the elderly pensioners, finally today all editorials are finding a crisis targeting one of the biggest tragedies. <sep><sep> Lalit finds it very serious the statement by Paul Berenger demanding the "ban" on Radio shows where participants in debates and listeners intervene live. <sep><sep> What we find ourselves in a moment where there is an opportunity for the people to question ownership and use of land in the Republic of Mauritius, and given that: <sep><sep> The Obegadoo Reform aimed to reduce competition in schools and began to accept what LALIT had been saying for a long time - that we need to stop the competitive system that CPE represents and start using the mother tongue as a teaching medium. <sep><sep> Thus, we can campaign for the mother tongue and do it well. <sep><sep> Lalit, since 1982, has brought to light the risks of nuclear equipment and the possible installation of nuclear facilities on Diego Garcia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Navin Ramgoolam is making the Prime Minister's job another matter entirely – he speaks only for himself, in his own name; often there is no Cabinet Ministers involved. <sep><sep> But meanwhile, several times we postponed the Conference Colombo. <sep><sep> Seems to me we made a political decision based on its program. <sep><sep> Here is an article on the launch of a book for details on the presence of the press and members of Lalit in the Press Conference. <sep><sep> It could also help us understand the difference between us and other associations (like Amnesty), which often are either misunderstood by the State, or misunderstood by it. <sep><sep> At the time there was much debate about what kind of script should be used. <sep><sep> Berenger emerged, with the help of Maurice Allet, as the person finally replacing Gaetan Duval. <sep><sep> There is so much confusion that we ourselves have to make efforts to understand what electoral reform means, what it doesn't mean. <sep><sep> He uses Neeta Deerpalsing, Professor Torul, Assirvaden, Dan Callikan, even Ramgoolam himself, to make trade unions – even though minimal – suffer more. <sep><sep> Meanwhile we are seeing the government encouraging communalism, when there are serious social issues. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How today's reservations began and what future faith they will bring back from the past. <sep><sep> Within the family, a part separates, there is no job security, most families can no longer subdivide, but where they live, the suffering is recurring, desperation in traditional politics has overflowed, people are turning to religion, superstition, and communalism, Individuals have lost their bearings, and society as a whole is drifting from one crisis to another. <sep><sep> there is a sinister introduction to a new law of industrial relations that aims to further weaken the entire working class. <sep><sep> There is a different loyalty to different forms of capital in the fields, that is between landlords and planters, if one gains more, the other gains less. <sep><sep> If there were not rights exact was the right name. <sep><sep> So, It's not a matter of chance, it must not make a mistake. <sep><sep> If he does not rest on facts and if he does not go through a degree of maturity, he will find himself empty. <sep><sep> In this sense, the authorities responsible for education, namely Ministers, heads of departments, inspectors, principals, and teachers, have a great responsibility in shaping the mental education of children. <sep><sep> Then the settlers must return to their parents' home. <sep><sep> And not only that, but the current government says it is getting an "early harvest", a more precious and better harvest than usual. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means it is in favor of a proportional dose and in that list, it “subsumes” the best loser. <sep><sep> Now, there was a boat, I don't know if you know, called Mauritius. <sep><sep> There are severe sanctions in the economy that are exacerbating the political problems the PT-PMSD Government is going through, and the MMM-MSM opposition is also going through it. <sep><sep> Tove Skutnabb-Kangas highlights the seriousness of the damage the State is causing if it acts in a way to eradicate the mother tongue, or even marginalize it, especially in education. <sep><sep> Sometimes we say "protect" these characteristics in God. <sep><sep> It dances if we do not look at the contribution of the work of the Internationals in a larger perspective and in its articulation and the total flow to face the occupation and other political problems for a clear solution in relation. <sep><sep> Private radios sometimes fall into this kind of "opposition" list. <sep><sep> This conference brought a controversy with Democracy Watch, which defended nationalism as a bourgeois ideology. <sep><sep> The union movement has shown that it will not just stand by, it will not just suffer. <sep><sep> Most of the time, the plots are revealed quickly to have a share in the cake. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Response: It is absolutely normal to announce that when St Felix, Blueprint, closes, it will cut 130 million, and when M. <sep><sep> They realized the amount their country was in debt. <sep><sep> Not just for the dad, but for someone more unique than another, the more authority he has, the more likely he is to have a uniform so it is normal for him to beat a Zen. <sep><sep> Then notice, only when there is a deadlock in negotiations, only then for the first time Navin Ramgoolam comes to power. <sep><sep> And we have also already started talking about the necessity of an opposition from a coalition government (which is now on the agenda in the newspapers, but which is not being able to materialize) which will seek to seriously tackle the economic crisis faced by workers. <sep><sep> But, can the capitalist system of Mauritius withstand a redistribution of wealth? <sep><sep> It is the lamp of traffic and drug consumption, the No. 1 scourge in our country, which has brought insecurity such as theft and violence against tourists, theft, hold-ups and even crimes linked to traffic and drug consumption. <sep><sep> Firstly, in this context, Alain Ah-Vee mentioned the American military base on Diego Garcia and its illegal occupation by America and Great Britain. <sep><sep> Presence of students, environmental activists, and peace activists. <sep><sep> As soon as he finished talking, the moon and the sun formed an alliance to re-plunge Planet Earth into total darkness. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is the IRA law that allows employers to abuse their power and dominate. <sep><sep> What it does, it works socially, but society doesn't appreciate everything it does. <sep><sep> They went to the other side of the river and took pictures of those dominating the colonies. <sep><sep> Like the PMSD, MSM is a party that cannot function well in opposition. <sep><sep> PMSD has a problem: when the economic crisis worsens, there will be a lot of pressure from the bourgeoisie for a stronger government, for example, a Government comprising of the  PMSD and MMM. <sep><sep> In the absence of a political program, people also seek individual solutions. <sep><sep> He said that this began as a communal reflex. <sep><sep> Workers in the parastatal sector are better protected and there is more democracy. <sep><sep> - Politically speaking, he is involved in Workers' "Economic Democratization" process. <sep><sep> But when the PM continues to antagonize the conflict in communal-religious gatherings, he makes a plea to the communal-religious organizations to form a front to support his position. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When it comes to bilateral talks, commercial deals are one thing, but for me I see it as a different economic scent. <sep><sep> When the army started to chase after the youth with their physical traits, some youths sought refuge in their uncle's house to hide. <sep><sep> We need to pay close attention to nature's study in that Burzwa State, in order to avoid entering the "historical block" that rules in the interest of bourgeois, and to know when the Historical Block begins to destabilize and fall apart. <sep><sep> The Local Government Bill will give the central government power to reduce grants from the central budget. <sep><sep> The Occupy Movement, which has become a focal point for many anti-capitalist forces, is almost melting away. <sep><sep> This meeting followed the decision-making of the Lalit Assembly, following issues of displacement and relational problems in the Lalit Youth Group at the time, to relaunch work on youth through a Commission. <sep><sep> Already there are many people in the nation of Mauritius in general and particularly in Rodrigues, awareness as well as willingness, to plant and cultivate and go back to peace. <sep><sep> Another serious flaw in the education system shows that educational politics in Mauritius are a failure, as it has a rather conservative pedagogy in its curriculum that focuses on competition. <sep><sep> Our team of 7 plus 4 will plant more trees in Tall in the direction of Tall. <sep><sep> Later I'll try to go spend a half day picking olives with the team at Abu S. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is a proposal that will help to fight against all forms of discrimination (not just communal), and at the same time fight against communal talk. <sep><sep> A new "me" has emerged in the debate on strategies for women's emancipation. <sep><sep> When other artists have learned this, they, together with the Justice Association, have started mobilizing to ensure justice in the case of the aggression against Nitin Chinien, and also in all other cases of police violence. <sep><sep> It seems that he has managed to fight against a series of occult conspiracies, including a meeting with L'Estrac and some leaders in the MMM and ex-MMM. <sep><sep> Here, we also need to explain these other two attempts to stabilize a historic block: MMM in 1982, and then MSM, from 1983, and with MMM in government in 1991 and 2000. <sep><sep> We are pleased to publish for our visitors, content that was distributed. <sep><sep> These groups were part of the same founding concept to say that everyone is one people, one nation, namely the workers. <sep><sep> There is no need to go far to see the crisis in the Euro Zone, it is serious for the capitalist economy here. <sep><sep> -So: The bourgeois ideologists say you must not only take action that has the possibility of questioning the capitalist system itself. <sep><sep> to withstand a devaluation, misery, and the possibility of repression by a coalition government that may form after the election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are many families where the head of the household says: 43% of families in their parliament. <sep> <sep> The proximity criterion gives the advantage to people who live in this Indian Ocean island. <sep> <sep> In 2000, Ramgoolam-Duval voted for the Public Security Act which could restrict freedom. <sep> <sep> Each individual, he plays a modest role, but he also plays a role in history. <sep> <sep> - At the same time, we have discovered the expansion of BAI piracy (Rawat/Beebeejaun) in many sectors in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> For example, there was a discovery by Lubieck (probably German), which is called "metabolism". <sep> <sep> Clearly, the European Union also wants to prevent a dramatic increase in imports from the Least Developed Countries that can greatly benefit from the "Anything but Arms" initiative. <sep> <sep> with his little child, he looks at him fondly for his rendition of James Furcy's long poem in Creole language in the play Ti Bato Papye. <sep> <sep> that through economic dependence and land ownership, many countries will sink deeper into the global capitalist economic system. <sep> <sep> If we look at the last 3 months since there have been resignations, all our sectors, regional are functioning absolutely normally. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, it is the MBC boss, the mouthpiece of the regime! U paid Peter Craig who was one of the nationalist firebrands at that time. <sep><sep> How do you read them, your articles? This is our big question. <sep><sep> And in the private sector, directors were in a position to create a common platform - even against the 2 laws proposed by the Government. <sep><sep> (3) New building design for a good ecological and energy system that does not depend on electricity. <sep><sep> But we all know, this flood also has a monetary value. <sep><sep> This is what will enable the process to question the capitalist system responsible for the crisis. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee has thrown a couple of notes on the super discourse that Arundhati Roy has made about the situation on the ground in Lend. <sep><sep> Then we will know how many people live in a situation where they have fewer rights than a lodger, live in secrecy, in constant conflict, in a family home because they have no rights. <sep><sep> Diego Garcia it's a bit like a microcosm that shows all of us the dangers of globalization. <sep><sep> Finally decide to support Timi's election as leader and create an administrative team. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Marie Luce Faron came to her senses, together with the musicians she is familiar with - and that evening she felt as confident as an Ella Fitzgerald, whom I have already heard give a Live 2-hour concert in the USSR in 1967 - it was already a gift.<sep><sep> There are individual and collective transport problems that the government can use to sabotage worker transportation mobilization.<sep><sep> The second proposal regarding Agriculture concerns the recent drought VRS.<sep><sep> There is no longer a "communist" bureaucratic system in the world (Soviet and Chinese Bloc).<sep><sep> The increase in the number of plantations also meant that a "memory reserve" was established during the sugar boom.<sep><sep> Society is suffering from disorders sown by the capitalist system in crisis.<sep><sep> Cindy Clelie also spoke about the importance for members and sympathizers of LALIT to understand the systemic crisis that exists.<sep><sep> Now that the crisis is becoming more severe, it will last longer than expected.<sep><sep> There will be two more speakers, Ragini Kistnasamy and Lindsey Collen.<sep><sep> The working class will take power, but the privileged who guard that power will resist. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Collecting students from the university on evenings for those who work and haven't managed to go to college and university. <sep> Success the campaign Mission: We must plant food on Earth Talisman. <sep> The LALIT addressed copies of our proposal to each deputy. <sep> You will notice that LALIT activists are members of various unions, in neighborhood associations without us seeking direction. <sep> Bidze's speech that Xavier Duval is presenting will be situated in a context where the economic crisis is worsening. <sep> If the press mentions this in the election campaign, he will be against one block or another, either for or against it. <sep> At one point, he contributed to reinforcing principles that were wrong, but he couldn't stop them. <sep> The state is an instrument in the ruling class. <sep> It is clear that the Ptr and MMM have the same policy, except for their recent negotiation. <sep> When the election is over and the counting is done, the Electoral Commission nominates 8 victorious deputies based on communities they have declared. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Workers need to understand that in a capitalist system, the worker will never get all his rights because in this system, the work belongs to the boss. <sep><sep> You hear that State Commercial Bank has exceeded 1.5 billion in profits. <sep><sep> LALIT has been consistent in their political work on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> When people fear that the dollar will lose value, they sell more of it, then when people buy it, there is an excess of dollars, then its value increases. <sep><sep> This is also true in the case of the Palestinians and among the Israeli soldiers. <sep><sep> Within the Social Alliance, there are three tendencies: one in favor of an alliance with MMM, another in favor of an alliance with MSM, and one that believes the Social Alliance is strong enough to not need any alliances. <sep><sep> It exists through work - not the work of this worker, but the work of other groups of workers who know how to operate this machine. <sep><sep> When PT/MSM/PMSD came to power in 2010, we found that it was a victory over the seeds of instability. <sep><sep> There are 2 Lalit comrades R. Seegobin and L. Collen who are victims of this kind of repression. <sep><sep> The Labour Party says to all voters, that is to say all workers, that its program is to work towards enlarging the number of people in the bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> She has become somewhat like in the books of other countries. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen has faced political forces caught up in a maze, one by one. <sep><sep> We want the problem of society to be revealed through an increase in freedom, not an imposition of repression, as the MMM-MSM-PMSD government is doing. <sep><sep> They tend to disregard their heritage in two ways: one is the great classical Greek philosopher, Epicurus, and the other is Marx who made two decrees: <sep><sep> A strategy that is pushing the country towards the destruction of agricultural land, monopolization of regions in the country, delocalization, deindustrialization, and destruction of wetlands. <sep><sep> There have been certain contradictions; the Ministry of Agriculture has become the Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, in 2008 they established the Food Security Fund, some institutions have entered into agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> To increase our courses, we need a new framework, but it is important to have a new framework to defend a good language policy. <sep><sep> It is falling into a vortex downward spiral, into conflict and disorder. <sep><sep> This movement is affecting industrial displacement, global growth, the sufferings of the sugar industry in our society. <sep><sep> Today, the Moris T-shirt trade has fallen into the books of other countries, and finally here a certain number have been laid off, or are about to close. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Also, the article of Rada Kistnasamy on the mini-budget procedure in the ka-la, page 171. <sep><sep> This kind of internal contradiction provides instability in a venerable institution. <sep><sep> In response to the question from the press, Ram Seegobin has quoted verbatim what 114 said. <sep><sep> And among these two alliances, the press had a preference: editorialists of the newspapers L'Express, Le Mauricien, Week-End either clearly or implicitly stated that the MSM-MMM coalition would have been better. <sep><sep> The resignation of Finance Minister Sithanen is a sign that Mauritius is in a crisis in its entire system, that is, a "systemic" crisis. <sep><sep> It is difficult to say if the musician-artist Konntou was programming Gondwana's development in this way or if he was learning through experience, but what is clear is that from the outset, the new-old fetus was being reborn. <sep><sep> This policy aims to develop an important intellectual capacity: our intelligence. <sep><sep> But if it is more than 2 days, then you need a doctor's certificate to prove that you were sick. <sep><sep> In the history section, First Prize Sedley Assonne for "Destination Mars", Encouragement Prize Rashid Bundhoo for "Ma, tell me!", Jovanthita Astride Cylandrie for "A little disabled story". <sep><sep> This comes from the idea of "intellectual power," the role of intelligentsia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Shakti Devi, who everyone called Devi, but he was strong, hugged her. <sep> <sep> The lady, the owner of the house, kicked him out, put his belongings, his suitcase, on the sidewalk. <sep> <sep> *The government needs to invest and take people to work in the renewable energy sector, and we go directly to "worker control" on the site. <sep> <sep> Peasants, landless people, are being forced off their land to work there and get a pay that workers get in Israel. <sep> <sep> And Ramgoolam has until the end of February 2013 to leave this nest. <sep> <sep> The decision of the Laver to abolish the quota since 2017, together with the persistent recession here, will worsen the economic situation even further. <sep> <sep> They have to wait for services elsewhere, going through the villages in the scorching sun. <sep> <sep> The Ptr / PMSD government is doing all kinds of tricks to keep their majority which is well frozen. <sep> <sep> I can say that the African Union has 53 members, and its members also export to America through what we call "Preferential Access". <sep> <sep> And what puts a flaw in the PT program: that is, to expand the bourgeois social base (through the formation of a larger bourgeoisie through state intervention, which is now considered as "favoritism", "favoritism", "corruption"). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the current era, it means a neoliberal policy. <sep><sep> In contrast, all other parties present, are they representing the "people" or "situated" youth through Central Committees and only through the "situated" youth do they have influence. <sep><sep> In Great Britain, journalists so infiltrated private lives of public people that, without a blink, they go on to do illegal things, like hacking phones! <sep><sep> Recently, there has been a wanted phenomenon, they exist and declare that there are 15,000 people who signed their petition, for a big demonstration in Port Louis. <sep><sep> But, people who worked on that rice plantation are still there. <sep><sep> Rumours have emerged regarding relations that Jagdish Koonjul, representing Mauritius at the United Nations, has taken on the resolution the Americans have drafted on Iraq. <sep><sep> We must attack the politicians responsible for the disaster we are in. <sep><sep> Lalit has done a long analysis on the Government's White Paper on Industrial Relations Act (See the latest section on our website), and on the law on Public Private Partnerships (PPP, see on our site). <sep><sep> However, my father did not even go to school, yet he is a very thoughtful, intelligent person. <sep><sep> Where capitalism has begun to give signs of weakness in America (professors in Chicago), in South Africa (Marikana and all the miners in the country) and in some parts of the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this way, if like this, each child in the First class will have 2 manuals for these 2 sizes. <sep><sep> Not easy. So, what the workers have organized under the leadership of Ramesh Khaytoo, was a total strike Annex by Annex in Medine. <sep><sep> This kind of predisposition is more like a sign of an extreme right-wing group. <sep><sep> A union must now have more than 30 members, otherwise it will fail. <sep><sep> But on a Saturday night, Timi and Balram were shocked. <sep><sep> Following the UNHRC decision, there has been a debate at a higher level on the BLS issue where the debate has become more common, where there is even a suggestion that it will lead to a new communal census. <sep><sep> And even when the results of the general elections were revealed, Gilbert Ahnee and Raj Meetarbhan were so shocked, so disappointed in the corrupt system that they stopped criticizing the system altogether. <sep><sep> When you are on the Central Committee you bring leadership from your branch and region in the Central Committee, and you are asked to report on the latest Central Committee in your branch and region. <sep><sep> When he heard his name during the review committee, the samba said, "Abe he doesn't understand,". <sep><sep> When the bourgeoisie take over here in Mauritius.) "Historical bourgeoisie", its influence in the "Historical Block" has begun to decline with the rise of a new bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Just after the celebration of Independence Day in March 2012, Navin Ramgoolam announced the extension of Parliament. <sep><sep> However, only the mother tongue is not yet medium, not yet used for science, math, history, geography, etc. <sep><sep> At that time, it was clear that the Labour Government was a very corrupt government. <sep><sep> It recognises the importance of making literacy accessible to everyone. <sep><sep> Also, not much has changed since today, where the bourgeoisie are not satisfied with any political party, including their own bourgeois party, neither its PMSD, nor its PT, nor its MMM. <sep><sep> Without a doubt, we would have thought it was a mix of corruption and conspiracy. <sep><sep> What is remarkable at this moment is that the Labour Party Government and PMSD can only gain strength from a weak Opposition, just like the MSM-MMM Opposition can only gain strength from a weak Government. <sep><sep> There are photos of prisoners and detainees from the countryside and photos of President Arafat scattered around the bunker. <sep><sep> A WHO representative made an unacceptable statement, and Mauritius is suffering from it. <sep><sep> But it represents a sector, as I said, an ideological sector in licenses that the government is talking about through the development of SMEs. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This conflict occured at a time when there were signs of an easing of tensions between Hamas and Israel. <sep><sep> Sometimes journalists ask, "In the '70s, why were unions able to have such large actions on the ground while today unions seem not to have that power anymore because they only talk a lot?" <sep><sep> but instead, they prefer to opt for the lowest salary in the country. <sep><sep> In the last mobilization of CNT workers, we have witnessed how this fragmentation weakens the ability of workers to face real problems and serious threats. <sep><sep> We cannot claim that there is no underlying meaning for Mauritianism. <sep><sep> And since nothing comes from nothing, nor does nothing disappear into nothing, and since we are living, and our society, all in constant, unceasing movement. <sep><sep> So, if the working class, in particular, fails to present an alternative, it will be a dark future. <sep><sep> In the case of Ram Seegobin, the police prosecutor called three witnesses: Inspector Pedre, officer Ellapen, and a security guard named Mr. Ragooputh. <sep><sep> We say that workers in the labor and artisan sectors need to demand agricultural diversification, and demand agricultural reform. <sep><sep> And we hope that in the US, the people will force their government to withdraw support and complicity from the State of Israel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Gaetan Duval, during the time of Aneerood Jugnauth as Prime Minister, faced a trial in court on allegations of conspiracy in the murder of MMM activist Azor Adelaide. <sep><sep> After school on Tuesday, we went to meet the Mohammed family to get more details on the arrests yesterday evening. <sep><sep> You are asking him to go vote, in isolation. <sep><sep> Last year we found a camp such as we never had in any federation. <sep><sep> Since his superior could not act in the right direction, Father Martin King decided to act according to his own mind. <sep><sep> But, we warn Chagossian leadership, that they risk a lot of historical defeat on all levels, and they will also be blamed in history if they separate those times, or, as Berenger, if they compromise some rights against others. <sep><sep> This method where the MSM-MMM activists insist on violence against political opponents, and it even reached a point where activists destroyed the opponent's wall just outside the school where people were voting. <sep><sep> - when non-violent resistance like the peaceful protests against Miray end with the death of a comrade H. <sep><sep> According to us, the Government sought legal advice, and found that the Mauritian State becomes responsible for genocide when it uses the education system to force children into linguistic groups of their parents. <sep><sep> SMEs threatened. In the capitalist system, large companies, major retailers, which are offensive. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Republic of Mauritius is granting access for a Palestinian diplomatic representation in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Ram has ended his speech on this note. <sep><sep> The literary movement has made its mark and efforts to support literature have become necessary. <sep><sep> Rajesh Ramlogun, who was arrested by the Raddhoa team, was tortured and died from "foul play". <sep><sep> Our friend Ward, Rajiati, was also a woman. <sep><sep> Dear: We have received 3-4 comments, all interesting, and what was expected, and can we also include Yves in this, we are counting on your expertise? <sep><sep> And the social democratic parties (British Labour Party, Socialist Party) have also lost their reputation. <sep><sep> Lalit stands against capitalism and against the bourgeois state that holds this system in place. <sep><sep> It considers that a captive novel in a moment in history in a world where everything is moving very quickly. <sep><sep> Therefore, LALIT will explain our campaign (already launched) for an alternative economic policy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, Alain Ah-Vee has adorned, with this CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) which has given grandeur, we have a second level of ideological defeat very serious, where the capitalist bloodsucker hoards a part of his surplus from exploiting us, pretending that he is doing us a great service. <sep><sep> He brought out that it is a celebration of the abolition of the system of slavery for the entire humanity. <sep><sep> He wants to say that the master has done, is doing, and will continue to do - even after it has been known what is being done. <sep><sep> In 2000 MMM-MSM had 52% and now in 2005 it has 43%. <sep><sep> He is rather descending into a world of swindling where he gets a strong name and passport and then he continues to descend until he falls into a brothel and then works hand in hand to be able to return to Mexico, his country of origin. <sep><sep> The social class is objectively defined by the relationship a person (or a family) has with the means of survival, and in the capitalist era, he wants to say that the relationship one has with the means one uses to produce all things. <sep><sep> Behind this campaign is to show that the historical bourgeois grandeur, he burns as well as his representatives, they burn in their feces. <sep><sep> We said that there is a possibility that when crisis bites, there will be a "coalition" government. <sep><sep> There are such rights in many countries, for example in Switzerland, in Canada, and it helps to have a democratic control over the deputies. <sep><sep> The story of a country that has embraced Mauritius, which has tortured the people of Mauritius to abandon the Chagos, which has sown 65 Lilies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sankont Sithanen, who met with Ramgoolam to discuss the same issue. <sep><sep> Especially when his mother told him to go because he was doing politics part-time. <sep><sep> The fish Sea Food Hub industry cannot be confined to this particular area in France. <sep><sep> (c) All commercialization of GMO plants, which are not necessary in today's world, should be done with the PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. <sep><sep> So, we will deepen democracy and make this deepening central in the debate on electoral reform. <sep><sep> When you vote Lalit, you are voting for this. <sep><sep> There are only export companies trying to because they want better value for the rupee. <sep><sep> This will lead to more people engaging in economic activities that will pose risks to biodiversity and flora. <sep><sep> This is the importance that 100-200 families saw the need to confront, this day was no different, and make it known. <sep><sep> He is going through, solely because some of his commercial partners have no interest in reimbursing him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> New shipments were being sent to the warehouse; <sep><sep> LALIT, why does it survive, when departure cannot be resisted? <sep><sep> The financial crisis has triggered a recession, and it is worsening it. <sep><sep> "People are eating less," Cyril Monty has pointed out that there are already serious problems when it comes to the quality and quantity of food being imported. <sep><sep> He also went to Palestine in 2004 to participate in demonstrations against the apartheid that the Israeli government is enforcing in Palestine. <sep><sep> Forty days into his penitence, he began to think that perhaps his misfortune was a disguised sacrifice in disguise. <sep><sep> We are witnessing a society where no one dominates another. <sep><sep> Even today, there is resistance within the press, and also within the Parliament. <sep><sep> Workers have been working diligently in opposition with the support of three transfers from the MSM. <sep><sep> They prefer to collude with this power-hungry ruler within the frame of an election that should be "free and fair." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, now LALIT is using "voice-over" in Creole to facilitate understanding. <sep><sep> Everywhere there were tables filled with special food; musicians and artists were giving performances; there were shows for children, adults, and the elderly. <sep><sep> And Vice President Raouf Bhundun was not in the country, and MP Ziz Pillay spoke in Parliament. <sep><sep> And he came with what he called "New Social Consciousness", which we found to be a betrayal of his struggle against capitalism. <sep><sep> Even though it sometimes seems that not everyone agrees with what you are proposing; debates on the ways to act in the workplace so that the boss doesn't have the upper hand were held. <sep><sep> Decisions on these strategies also had their importance. <sep><sep> On Wednesday, October 10, LALIT activists participated in a candlelight vigil in solidarity with the Burmese people organized by Amnesty in the evening at the Rights and Justice Square, Port Louis Municipality. <sep><sep> Yesterday, on November 1, we saw the political party as an "organization". <sep><sep> After all, it had to make way for MSM. <sep><sep> The referendum was beginning to show society's fragility. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Family relationships were more in favor of having a fixed dispenser located in a central location in Salfit to cover relationships well across the distance. <sep><sep> On 18th January 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers (including Ramgoolam, Baichoo, S.Mohamed, etc.) approved a restructuration plan for CNT, so that it no longer performs losses and becomes profitable as a private capitalist company. <sep><sep> Everyone write a poem in Kreol for a contest; they are invited to come together, start together with LPT, participate in a publication LPT. <sep><sep> Then nationalize a facility (Rose-Belle), nationalize electricity production for CEB, establish a State Bank, create SICOM. <sep><sep> In the new sector today, it's mainly ICT, Coral Center, where almost everyone who works there, comes in as equals. <sep><sep> As of now, these same products were worth Rs 3.6 billion. <sep><sep> Today with the concept of Comprador, a Marxist concept, to explain the difference between a nationalist bourgeoisie and a bourgeoisie that aligns its interests more with imperial powers. <sep><sep> But there are semantic nuances. Navin Ramgoolam is saying 3 things: <sep><sep> It's true that the unity of a political party, and the unity of a union, is different in certain ways. <sep><sep> The government of PTR/PMSD/MSM, which was elected in 2010, split, not even 2 years after the election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT takes pleasure in reprising a text from the MLF taking a position. <sep><sep> We said how a systemic crisis affects all the drawers we believe exist in life: our work life is affected, our family life is affected, our personal life is affected, our money is affected, our union is affected. <sep><sep> Ram made the observation that there is also a "working class"in it, and this because this class, is under attack. <sep><sep> 9. A group has decided to start and end a strike in 2 real spots (in the same location). <sep><sep> What LALIT is continuing to do is to bring about a campaign to mobilize people to force a recalcitrant government and an even more recalcitrant private sector to bring about a new economic and political alternative. <sep><sep> Therefore, the law is making provisions so that the private sector can take control of social services and public infrastructure. <sep><sep> People in the working class, and all people who have a reflective mind, have begun to find the four slogans of our campaign to be very accurate: We said: "DO NOT USE LEROY MONEY TO DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT". <sep><sep> We need to replace all machines in homes that do not have enough ecological standards, as well as appliances and other items as well. <sep><sep> We cannot make a one-off assistance, nor a "structural reform" as some people say, and then everything will be correct. <sep><sep> Also, in the Press Conference, there was Alain Ah-Vee, who presided, Rajni Lallah, Roland Boussac, Rada Kistnasamy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He knew that a good dose of nationalism was necessary for countries and people to fight against the greed and lies of powerful countries and forces. <sep> <sep> A political organization plays an important role in the struggle by maintaining a continuity in the political, programmatic, theoretical, and political practices that have been in place since one era to another. <sep> <sep> We hope that our visitors will find this document useful to understand the mutations that exist in today's media. <sep> <sep> Often the only advantage they hold, or believe they hold, is a relative mastery of the French and English languages, colonial languages. <sep> <sep> The only accusation against these two LALIT militants is that they allegedly insulted a police officer. <sep> <sep> Even at the level at which the SICAF is retaining R&A, they are starting to find out the mansion that was being built. <sep> <sep> When at our LALIT level - we had just left the MMM - when we criticized it, when we launched a strong offensive against this policy, Berenger's response was, "No, these are not IMF-WB dictates." <sep> <sep> LALIT has been working since 2010 on several weeks of work together with other organizations on electoral reform. <sep> <sep> 5. Same thing. When there is a national grammar that a teacher can use, it also equips all those "boxes" (that were previously circulating) as if Creole without grammar was nothing. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, in Le Mauricien of Monday 16 April, there is a long article describing the platform and demands for the Trade Union Congress in Bobasin: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is true that since the last election there have been 2-3 new recruits like Satish Boolell, Kee Cheong Lee Kwong Wing, Adil Meeah, Kavi Ramano, Josique Radegonde who have joined the MMM parliamentary team and given it a certain dynamism. <sep><sep> Currently, there is a system that has almost total control over the means of production, over almost all the resources of our planet. <sep><sep> The capitalist system is indeed, becoming more powerful, causing an industrial revolution in these cities, and expanding like something diabolical. <sep><sep> Workers have a policy called "economic democratization." <sep><sep> Lulu was very interested to know why I had become Palestinian. <sep><sep> When privatizing, there are fewer workers in the public sector, and fewer unions because in the private sector there is repression. <sep><sep> We are expecting a positive response as soon as possible. <sep><sep> It may make it a bit more complicated for me, but at the same time, it doesn't diminish anything in its essence. <sep><sep> Besides the functions directly related to the formal apprenticeship of a language, they also serve to provide a breath of fresh air to life, that is, to let children discover the aspects of life as they are. <sep><sep> In terms of tourism, the hotel occupation continues to decrease. This affects restaurants, shops, taxis, and even hotel housekeeping. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, we are launching a hunger strike from this Sunday the 19th to one hunger strike without eating or drinking. <sep><sep> On several occasions, the publication has developed a program where they criticize the direction of MMM from Lagos (where most of us were in MMM). <sep><sep> Every cartoonist draws a 'clown' and everyone knows who that is. <sep><sep> In LPT, we still believe in greatness and wisdom that exist in this phrase. <sep><sep> The Republic of Mauritius is supporting the Resolution for a Palestinian State in the United Nations later this September. <sep><sep> meaning in a systemic crisis, a systemic crisis that has unfolded since the protection of the textile and clothing sector. <sep><sep> Abortion or not abortion is her right and her decision. <sep><sep> Sometimes, like to advertise in Lakup, Ramgoolam claims his interlocutor himself. <sep><sep> All the energy that could have gone into challenging the liberal economy, went into single issues, individual rights, and the environment. <sep><sep> where there is licensure in the French Zone, it is not a coincidence that this type of repression exists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since 1983, when we left the MMM, many MMM members have been dismissed from GWF, and we start to reflect and develop new, more advanced strategies calling the Intersindikal Shop. <sep><sep> In times of downturn like we have gone through, where there is a slowdown in class struggle, where the working class is not so mobilized, a part of the struggle cannot be appropriated. <sep><sep> For a stronger representation for Rodrigues in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> The European Court of Human Rights, what can be done about Diego Garcia? <sep><sep> There are many questions that we as a union do not have answers to. <sep><sep> After Greenpeace has softened its stance, when Lalit has clearly explained why the English have established that marine park there. <sep><sep> And we are already working hard to galvanize support for an alternative economy of sugar and starch. <sep><sep> And also, the main organization for Chagossians today, the Chagos Refugee Group, has done absolutely fantastic and constructive work to gather Chagossians on a platform. <sep><sep> What we have just gone through in the Sugar Industry shows the transitional period where no one knows exactly what the situation is. <sep><sep> When the US Army B52 took off from Diego to bomb the people in Iraq, in Afghanistan, it did so from Diego which belongs to the Republic of Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the 1960s, the agriculture and industry sectors in Israel employed about 750,000 Palestinian-Israeli citizens. <sep><sep> This situation has also precipitated a political and institutional crisis between the new government and President A. <sep><sep> There are people who choose a team that appears viable: but in the last 15 years, everyone remembers that Berenger formed a Union and Baichoo in 87. <sep><sep> After the signature of the Pelindaba Treaty, there have been several articles in the press, and in particular an article by Henri Marimootoo which clearly explains the dangers of nuclear substances in the Indian Ocean, especially in Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Why did President Bush grant the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader in exile, the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007? <sep><sep> The NRB had determined the conditions and work environment in its smallest detail. <sep><sep> To create a breakthrough, the Constitution would be amended to increase the number of ministers and create ministerial positions without portfolios. <sep><sep> Going beyond this initial way to control space/time in the media. <sep><sep> You can use corn to feed, cornmeal, fried corn for animals, and corn dust. <sep><sep> Have most people thought enough about the implications of this policy? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is what does not represent the elite bourgeois Creole. <sep><sep> I was telling how in Mauritius, on the radio, the election kit meant there were elections. <sep><sep> Let's go vote for Berenger!" (Laughter) If we don't pay attention, it will come back. <sep><sep> We are protesting to express our anger against Israel and condemn the brutal massacre that its armed forces have perpetrated against civilians aboard the "Freedom Flotilla". <sep><sep> The historical block that it is, how it is changing today. <sep><sep> What's more, it's dangerously close to breaking the Constitutional deadlock at a time when they are all acting like desperate men, because they really are desperate men. <sep><sep> As the crisis worsens, government after government has come up with different plans to boost the economy for the benefit of entrepreneurs. <sep><sep> Fanfan was playing games with them but it was impossible for him to do otherwise. <sep><sep> Shyam Ramgoolam read his poem about a worker who had to wait to board a plane with a glimmer of hope shining like a Christmas present for his child. <sep><sep> He also hired a driver and a cleaner. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He called the Bambous police station on the Anna site, where all the workers were outside. <sep> Often his political opponent was the Workers' Party, which represented a certain bourgeois faction, while he, MMM, ended up, on the other hand, replacing PMSD as the defender of the interests of another bourgeois section, the historical bourgeois. <sep> PMSD passed repressive laws against workers like POA and IRA. <sep> Navin Ramgoolam came to rally on television against the exceptional profits that the sugar industry is making. <sep> Here, we are appointing a member for a large gathering against war and militarism in the Lend, where we will be able to further arguments. <sep> All essential services and public services must be under State control. <sep> The Ramgoolam-son has its "economic democratization" unit that Jean-Claude Bibi resorts to in Congress LALIT since early February, a unit attached to the Prime Minister's office. <sep> This kind of action bore fruit and contributed to bringing about the end of apartheid in South Africa. <sep> The ESC summit on Nomination Day signaled that no candidate from Lalit would accept a loser’s seat. <sep> It was in April that we formed the LALIT party. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Saturday, March 19th, the LALIT Commission on the Environment and Renewable Energy met at 1.30 p.m. and found the GRNW to be exceptional. <sep><sep> But here in Mauritius, we are already in the same situation, but even if we find it visible (Gris-Gris, or in commercial areas), people realize that the mechanism of financialization is so opaque, sophisticated, incomprehensible, that people cannot react. <sep><sep> Now, our comrades will have to start discussing the economic, political and trade union situation before we present the various reports of the different strict party structures. <sep><sep> There are trade unions and political movements that take the same leadership as us. <sep><sep> If we isolate LALIT for Chagos from this wider political program, for social action, for an internationalist Asian socialism, if we isolate LALIT, it becomes meaningless. <sep><sep> To all individuals and organizations that have militated for the Kreol and Bhojpuri languages, and are still fighting against wind and tide. <sep><sep> Then there was a breakdown in the DSP, and we kept ties with the DSP, but at the same time became closer with the RSP. <sep><sep> The reason they made it 30 was to prevent what they call "proliferation," that is, preventing fragmentation. <sep><sep> As for this demobilization, or the MMM experience, there is another reason for this demobilization. <sep><sep> In the film "An Inconvenient Truth" by Al Gore (LALIT organized sessions where we watched the film, and also its shortcomings), we can find a link between these two points. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Grandparents, their place, were more interested in their grandchildren because they recalled, through children, the innocence and natural joy that disappears as children grow up. <sep><sep> The MSM has built another historic Block, when it was in power (even if often with Workers alongside). <sep><sep> Lagos, it is a political organization based on a program, on a strategy. <sep><sep> It is a rather authoritarian method, for example: "I am the leader, no one needs to understand anything, come!" <sep><sep> In the public sector, it is estimated that 60-75% of public servants are unionized. <sep><sep> A person is eligible only if he can speak and also, if he is in incapacity because he is not clear-minded or for other physical reasons, can clear English well enough to actively participate in Parliament work. <sep><sep> But what these allegations have exposed is that PT, MMM, MSM and PMSD all have the same capitalist policy, <sep><sep> For example, with the increase in fuel prices, the lack in the tourism sector, Air Mauritius in crisis, it is fragile and could easily become prey to an OPA by an imperialist airline company. <sep><sep> They will do everything to prevent our campaign from gaining momentum. <sep><sep> They would argue that it is "Mauritianism" that is not "bourgeois," but rather "popular and democratic." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government in the space of 6 months has taken measures to update the 1972 Census which concerns the community. <sep> Then we ate evening tea with mint leaves all under olive trees. <sep> If you are interested in helping in this task do not hesitate to contact Lalit. <sep> Alain Ah-Vee explained the case against Police Commissioner in detail (Read the article on 3rd March). <sep> We all had the same way of living. <sep> * If you want to understand why Rama Sithanen resigned on two occasions and the conflicts that exist within the Labour Party between Sithanen and Nita Deerpalsing - Cader Sayed Hossen. <sep> Just remember, the boss prevents them from bringing trees inside!". <sep> Therefore, the Labour Party itself hears it talk like Lalit once today, it will not act in the interests of the working class. <sep> Only one child who won a gift from his grandfather. <sep> Yesterday in the District Court No.3 Port Louis in front of Magistrate Seebaluck, the Police have charged Ram Seegobin formally in relation to anti-Bush activities and the AGOA Forum, at a time when George W. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They say that due to the decrease in rivalry between the superpowers, the great powers have started to move forward, there is no justification for a Zone of Peace in the Indian Ocean! <sep> <sep> Jean Suzanne's mistakes do not seem to be forcing Ramgoolam to pay a high political price, but it remains a fact: Jean Suzanne was an advisor to Ramgoolam's government. <sep> <sep> We need to avoid demands that do nothing but give an advantage to certain establishments over certain capitalists. <sep> <sep> So, a country that is already too advanced, it will risk advancing even further. <sep> <sep> There is propaganda being circulated, especially through commercial press, trying to create the idea that trade unions are not adapting to the new reality. <sep> <sep> Unfortunately in the elections, there are only these two alliances. <sep> <sep> • Reparations and compensation for the Chagossians The decision was for a member of the Sharingon-Mauritius group to draft a document which includes all points, then call upon a representative of all the organizations present at the time. <sep> <sep> The Top 20 (like Top of the Pops) were St Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, Descartes, Epicurus, Heidegger, Hobbes, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Marx, Stuart Mill, Nietche, Plato, Karl Popper, Bertrand Russell, Sartre, Schopenhauer, Socrate, Spinoza, Wittgenstein. <sep> <sep> It is suggested to, in a ‘savant’ way, reinstate the representativeness of the parties in the national assembly, then the name ‘Best Loser’, which will then upset this very representation! <sep> <sep> We have found F. Tulede a member of Women for Life, a women's organization that operates as a coordination center for a network of 20 women's groups in 20 villages in the Salfit region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After that, you have to associate to work together, and decide what to do with the surplus together. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin started by saying that his size is very practical, so he won't talk too much, so there will be plenty of time to discuss later, on how to continue building our part. <sep><sep> Social workers adopt “poor” Anfet the article is based on a Report that a group of social workers and university researchers conducted on 75 families classified as 'extremely poor'. <sep><sep> A large proportion of global food production is being diverted to biofuel production due to profit; <sep><sep> What is most striking at present, we have a penalty law from the Industrial Relations Act to the Employment Rights Act, we have had a penalty law from the Labor Act to the Employment Rights Act, and despite that, it happened 5 years ago, everything that has arisen in the industrial culture takes time before it changes. <sep><sep> So, we held a big protest at La Place D'Armes, announcing the strike, after the meeting finished, everyone who was going to the strike had 9 months, I believe. <sep><sep> This is how we know it, because we have studied it. <sep><sep> Employers are also asking the Government to come up with a clear policy on ethanol. <sep><sep> But, we have noticed that when the new Government was formed, as Alain mentioned, the Minister of Agriculture changed his name: he is now called the Minister of Agro-Industrial Affairs. <sep><sep> Through the press, we hear that the "friendly country," which is mainly the African Union, does not agree. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Mother tongue is compulsory, and that is where he learns to express himself in writing. <sep><sep> 75% of our nutrition is imported "75% of the food we consume is imported," he said. <sep><sep> We have 650,000 active population out of 1.3 million people. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy said that today we are realizing a food crisis worldwide. <sep><sep> Due to a larger outflow, other countries have seen encouragement by a banking system that has excess liquidity to finance start-ups. <sep><sep> In Tunisia today, for example, a “historic block” that has lasted 23 years, has quickly fallen within 3 weeks; unemployment, price increases, all this has created a movement where the same lawyer and professor movement had fallen, which has caused a block. <sep><sep> When everyone was taking care of their affairs, it was heading towards Princess Prathna's house. <sep><sep> Ramgoolam is using PR, communal classification and BLS for his confusing and deceptive process to gain more power. <sep><sep> And when we meet, we are discussing as a group. <sep><sep> Major projects like Les(Jin Fei and NeoTown) are all stalling. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In Mauritius, we already use one (at home except for water), but we can also use one with a large reflector that gathers enough water to produce steam for a reactor system that will produce carbon. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, we are one step ahead in terms of experience. <sep><sep> Whether it's a disaster or not, it's not easy for the police to testify to the same story two years later than they decided to tell two years earlier when they made their statement. <sep><sep> But when his "concept" is over, what will he do? <sep><sep> Finally, it is the opportunistic position and superficial parliamentary position of the PT parliamentarian that allows the MMM to pay a very minimal political price for a very serious situation: the PT is making its traditional "walkouts". <sep><sep> He said that everyone is congratulating us for our campaign, until now, and at his arrival at the Assembly, two people stopped him to express appreciation for Lalit's campaign. <sep><sep> Today there was a press conference by Lalit to launch international action to close military bases on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Which means they rule as private companies to profit, and they are entirely funded by ads from private companies. <sep><sep> Jean-Claude's faith in humanity had no limits. <sep><sep> b) In Bidze, it is clearly announced that institutions such as the National Remuneration Board (NRB), Pay Research Bureau (PRB) will disappear and be replaced by a National Wages Council. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are 2 Sarts on the mother tongue which the LPT, together with another 25 organizations, have developed. <sep> <sep> Regarding the battle against privatization, Lalit has taken a stand against pension privatization and against targeting for pensions. <sep> <sep> For the 2010 elections, Navin Ramgoolam was seeking a three-term majority, to amend the Constitution (in a way that is still unclear). <sep> <sep> Carol Benson says it is important not to depend on outsiders, but rather to use all existing resources here. <sep> <sep> There was much more understanding, more sharing, more taking into account the feminine. <sep> <sep> Samy would go sit beside his mother, and Tamby, behind, would cling to his blanket so tightly because he was afraid. <sep> <sep> LALIT believes that during the "down-turns", as today, when the working class is still rebuilding its strength to stand against such nonsense, this kind of absurd action will still be taken. Its dance, according to us in LALIT. <sep> <sep> Therefore, sometimes racism in its precise and practical contexts, becomes communal and class-based. <sep> <sep> When Thatcher and Reagan promoted a repressive capitalist reign, and began to impose segregation. <sep> <sep> Today, we are realizing the importance of objectively correct factors, the importance of building subjective factors. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that the MMM and the Labour Party, in the last 2-3 days, are trying to create a platform for the general elections, a platform that includes certain strong points in the LALIT Program, such as the Creole language (and other issues like the repatriation of Diego Garcia), similar to how the Social Alliance before the 2005 elections created a platform with other strong points in the LALIT Program (against insult for old age pensions, and in favor of holding village elections). <sep><sep> Furthermore, if there is an organization known for promoting the Creole language, it is LALIT. <sep><sep> The objective reality is that the working class is facing the truth. <sep><sep> This means that the new Mauritian government, the new British government, both Trade Unions still exist, these 2 governments will be in power when these negotiations take place. <sep><sep> He is not saying how many years, how many days, how many weeks, how many months, how many years of study he has completed in learning the Creole language, which has helped him in this task. <sep><sep> Today, this justification is no longer based on neo-liberal ideologies or regulations imposed by financial capital, in the neo-liberal era. <sep><sep> And during this era, all scientific discoveries that were happening in one field, were followed by another. <sep><sep> In the introduction, Lindsey Collen, who was presiding, mentioned that the LALIT Program was being developed after 4-5 months of work in different LALIT branches and in the LALIT Family Commission. <sep><sep> When I went to discuss with my teacher, a Miss, who I needed to talk to, she told me that she wasn't going to let me go in a few months, because I need to address her in French. <sep><sep> In November 2009, at the International Conference of the Party of the Left in Caracas, Hugo Chavez made a call to launch a 5th International that would bring together social movements worldwide and also left parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, when comrade Kreepalloo talks about food security, he mentions how the majority of agricultural land, land that can be planted on, is underutilized. <sep><sep> But when, after a vote of confidence, it has become evident that there are implications in terms of the military occupation of part of our country, there, they are facing a moral dilemma. <sep><sep> You have become rather ambiguous about it, lately. <sep><sep> Action took the form of a meeting at Lemer Jame's base, representing the olive planters of Jame, the village olive groves of Marda. <sep><sep> It should rather focus on a country with a relatively small population that has a good level of multilingualism. <sep><sep> When I returned, I visited Mr. S. <sep><sep> and the boss came to say that they will no longer provide elderly pensions as a right; that they will no longer pay 1/2 the exam fees for SC and HSC as a right; that certain hospital treatments may become chargeable. <sep><sep> A request, is not just a literal question - it means to see what you are asking for. <sep><sep> - My father will no longer work in the tourism department of the Topume Islands and the first minister of Toutouk Town. <sep><sep> At that time, just before the outbreak of the 2nd World War, Leon Trotsky, in collaboration with his other comrades, developed a program called "Transitional Program". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And today when we are discussing action and litigations, it is a moment to re-evaluate the link between our parts, our programs, strategies, actions and litigation methods (which are part of our strategies, respondents from our programs). <sep><sep> He says that he and his family have lived in extreme misery conditions where they have suffered social, cultural and economic oppression. <sep><sep> Today, Navin Ramgoolam is saying on television that due to Mauritius losing preferential access to markets on the international scene, and due to the drastic fall in textile prices, we are in this situation. <sep><sep> We find ourselves in a struggle for the mother tongue to become the language used in education, in Parliament. <sep><sep> But, there are difficulties at the language level when it comes to organization. <sep><sep> But, our society, our country, was created under economic pressure. <sep><sep> He has been eradicating it since monarchy and aristocracy, and often from the Church as well, which used to be part of the State. <sep><sep> This has led to deregulation, where capitalists have reacquired power and relaunched their accumulation. <sep><sep> Families who were left in the colonies where women were not allowed to leave to work, they have to work from home. <sep><sep> However, the Government could have allowed people to choose their doctor in a more developed public health system. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A second point has been raised in the Saturday 3 October newspaper, where Xavier Duval (PMSD) and Alan Ganoo (MMM) have been cited. <sep><sep> He said his mother if Célimène invites him to come, otherwise 'get in'. <sep><sep> That he calls the "claw-back" system, which means "re-grab it"; meaning the Government gives everyone a pension as a universal right, then in another budget measure, the Government claws the money back. <sep><sep> * Do not let the union claim and declare disputes while there is a valid Collective Agreement. <sep><sep> It is present at all times, except just before a great revolution. <sep><sep> Today we are in a crisis and the crisis is intensifying, the working class has to face unemployment, has to face a rising cost of living. <sep><sep> This mobilization must be based on a program of righteousness, at the same time on an alternative economic program; thus people will take society into their own hands, we all will take our destiny in our hands. <sep><sep> The question arises as to which direction LALIT will continue to work to strengthen the party and for the construction of a movement that supports our Program that favors workers and the poorest people. <sep><sep> So today we know what that means. <sep><sep> It is Lalit that has kept these three central political elements together: Lalit for the reunification of Mauritius, Lalit for the right of return and reparations, Lalit to pull this city's roots from this beautiful island. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is weakened in this capitalist labyrinth. <sep> Or else our noses will be tickled by all kinds of salty temptations - I am thinking a grand-style stroll. <sep> And we forget the brutal displacement of all the people who were living on Diego Garcia, on Salomon, on Peros Banos, and on other islands as well, who lived like Six Islands. <sep> He will benefit the companies in France, England, and Holland and in Mauritius which have built their labyrinth on the back of a slave system. <sep> According to Health Minister Gaza, there are 103 Palestinians who have been injured by Israeli gunfire since March 2010. <sep> Thus we exploit the advantages of conflict between different ideologies to create a critical space in its fissures and fractures, and negotiate an emancipation action that fits our reality. <sep> Do you too, as an individual, watch TV, read the newspapers, watch CNN, or BBC. <sep> We have a few participants from other countries, whom we welcome: Grace Goldfarb and Abbie, Eva To, Christine Gautier, and Gerard Gueniffey. <sep> There, also, after a long struggle, he managed to regain at least 2 portions of land where his family's house used to be until today. <sep> However, he had come forth so that he could reap popularity like Besancenot. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We were holding a 2-day assembly, Octave Wiehe, University of Mauritius, with 1,000 delegates. <sep><sep> A small step sufficient for what we speak about alternative economy, agricultural diversification, working conditions. <sep><sep> We can also have a class struggle which is collective, but unconscious. <sep><sep> He gave an overview in his speech, bit by bit, and allowed us to choose what interests us the most. <sep><sep> He gave us food and drink, carbide, so that we can have energy, work more. <sep><sep> This restrictive idea led many editors to think that an election by him, normally brings about good progress, but the system has become even more corrupted. <sep><sep> However, MMM, after this election, and this is what we have been predicting for a long time, it has become like how PMSD used to be. <sep><sep> Saying values are decreasing continuously, because you are not progressing at all, even if the goals are huge. <sep><sep> what we call a state bourgeoisie, precisely because it uses state power to change from a capitalistic to a very big capitalist, alongside historic bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> We are talking about complete decolonization, we are talking about re-unification of our country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will create a beautiful lamp in harmony with Mauritius' natural heritage. <sep><sep> At one point, during the All Workers Conference, there was what was called "BOO" (Build Operate and Own), 'BOT' (Build Operate and Transfer): <sep><sep> It was feared that his jokes would end in tragedy. <sep><sep> SAJ knows that Ramgoolam does not have a 2/3 majority in Parliament to set up a Tribunal to impeach him. <sep><sep> They demand that the papers must be right and the right papers must be given! <sep><sep> If you don't have a copy yet, ask members of LALIT that you know. <sep><sep> It is a good reminder that Sri Lanka has been condemned by the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2008 for its record of human rights violations and its drift towards dictatorship. <sep><sep> After the Russian Revolution, all capitalist governments deployed their armies against the new power. <sep><sep> After the Second World War, there was a re-grouping of certain philosophical and academic currents, among some who were Swiss and others Marxist, all from the University of Frankfurt, who survived the Nazi Holocaust. <sep><sep> What was moral became immoral, what was legal became illegal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is indeed a concentration of power in the hands of men, not women. <sep> <sep> How the worker, artisan, labourer and even our children have work. <sep> <sep> This interference can be a real disturbance where diglossia and linguistic insecurity create two sides in languages. <sep> <sep> Sometimes these processes are things that have already happened in the past (like a cyclone a week before a major storm), or an earthquake far away that triggers a tsunami. <sep> <sep> In the losing team, whose program was to defend electoral fraud of Ashok Jugnauth, there was Ashok Jugnauth himself, MMM and a "corrupt" who has been a member of the Independence Party, PMSD. <sep> <sep> They are in the camp that supports Finance Minister Sithanen, saying the Mauritian economy is "resilient," so there are no serious problems. <sep> <sep> And a conscious political struggle rests on a program, that is a program of how we will face a situation, how we will get out of where we are today and go where we want to go. <sep> <sep>  Guaranteeing cover against rises in bank interest rates, against rises in the price of wheat, follows the CPI, and even goes so far as to provide payment guarantees, even if they do not provide proof of loss in cases of major disasters such as floods, fire, hurricanes and natural disasters. <sep> <sep> Gilbert Ahnee, editor of Le Mauricien, will tell you how independent he truly is, in what he writes. <sep> <sep> But the class struggle today, whose goal is socialism, is a class struggle where a class that has no economic power is bringing about a struggle to gain political power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is important to find a solution to the economic crisis among the working class, as we all know how to do. <sep><sep> The Red Zone means absolute access is prohibited to everyone except the military. <sep><sep> This force that makes the most powerful weapons in the world impossible. <sep><sep> A.Jugnauth often describes in the press how he initiated the second wave of industrialization, where there were almost full employment in Mauritius, with nearly 100,000 people working in the textile industry. <sep><sep> We will address you in your language, in our language, and then translate/interpret for visitors. <sep><sep> In the LPT, since our foundation, for 33 years, we have built support for the punishment we propose. <sep><sep> Unemployment is increasing, and crime is on the rise. <sep><sep> During this pandemic, your time, known as the LALIT time, is well-known. <sep><sep> Here we are not talking about the dependence of love that Diego has for Paloma - a love that is just a beautiful facade of fidelity and sincerity. <sep><sep> But, this law that allows us to do this, in the same legal system, there is another law that says, at any time, someone can stop those rights we have. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He does not provide a single solution to question some slogans like the government is doing on "biotechnology," and he does not provide a solution to propose the use of new technology. <sep><sep> In the Seminar, members since 2011, we have reflected a lot on how to make the issue of "electoral reform" become a national political agenda. <sep><sep> For explanations about the struggle, in the neighborhood, on the work site, and among students. <sep><sep> Here, when you have a victory, a small victory in that period, a difficult period, we find that the big victory is being won. <sep><sep> And when the economy is in crisis it affects the bourgeoisie, which is at the mercy of the influence it has on the leaders of those parties so that they keep their parties on a trajectory that does not threaten their power, their economic reign. <sep><sep> To do foolish things where elders who do not know how to act through ignorance. <sep><sep> They were everywhere and they always had a good word for everyone. <sep><sep> It is not supposed to represent the interests of workers in different sectors, to support together. <sep><sep> He will attend our Conference (on the 1st and 2nd of November last year), called "State of Banding Together," which will look at the trajectory of traditional political parties. <sep><sep> As it was, all children like a right, received subsidies on that fee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, Ram Seegobin received a call from Radio One informing him that there will be no debate program on "Should we use Mauritian Creole language in the National Assembly?" which was scheduled for this Sunday. <sep><sep> In most cases, they are not people who listen to the words of elderly people from oppressed social classes, solely because they do not know them. <sep><sep> On one side, there are those accustomed to attending major religious ceremonies, while on the other side, there are those focused on a political program. <sep><sep> And in the Mouvement Liberatoire de Franze, we dedicate this progress to it. <sep><sep> and we need to focus on an alternative that is not just an alternative but one that truly has the merit to strengthen connections and complicity with its offspring, who have intelligence. <sep><sep> However, for the worker himself, the courage to work on something really useful is essential for progress, for his to be able to work, for him to have that courage in his life. <sep><sep> They are forced to develop missiles launched from the sea because no country in the world wants to base its military on its land. <sep><sep> Branch, Assembly member, KS, BP, Program Reunion, Commission, they all understand. <sep><sep> We should not just wait for a leader to come up with a program a week before the election. <sep><sep> And perhaps there are a few cases like Madun Dulloo's. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Go look for another place to resume this discussion with people who laugh at it. <sep><sep> The reforms that have been made, have inspired authentic political movements: <sep><sep> Comrade Zorz: Judging by your reaction, introducing class struggle, when we focus on unionism, becomes problematic, because they feel threatened. <sep><sep> On the other hand, there is a central place for ecology in the Pu Alternative Economic Policy campaign that LALIT is leading. <sep><sep> To enter Palestine, control of immigration from Israel is necessary. <sep><sep> For 2009, if each member can invite new people, it will help. <sep><sep> all movements against capitalist globalization and against militarism and imperialism; all movements in favor of disarmament and demilitarization; all movements against racism, all in favor of liberation and sovereignty. <sep><sep> It is against these three issues that Marx came up with a theory that inserts humanity into a natural reality, where there are sanctions in real material reality, but where there are elements "either" included. <sep><sep> It seems that P. Berenger keeps all options open so that he can participate in elections at a time when he thinks it is favorable for him. <sep><sep> It is true that agriculture and modern livestock apparently need to be done on a large scale and require major investment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Electronic Magazine, Pambazuka in South Africa on Alternative Economics, 2006, by Alain Ah-Vee, Ram and Lindsey on "LALIT campaign for an alternative economy". <sep> <sep> There may also be a contestation that can go all the way to recount even to a "scrutiny" in front of the Supreme Court to decide on the final result. <sep> <sep> And as he exits, he finds this injustice, he denounces, just as we do? <sep> <sep> In every company: some will end up going on strike, some will not end up going on strike, so when decisions are being made on a strike (if it were democratic) it would be even more difficult to get a true majority, because there would be workers; some are to lose their jobs, some are not to lose their jobs, according to a supposed "resistance" that we assume the employer should keep. <sep> <sep> Firstly, the WTO has ensured that there will no longer be "price guarantees" or market guarantees organized by the State here or the State in Europe. <sep> <sep> And there was a protest in Petite Riviere against violence by several police officers on 2 families. <sep> <sep> While the riots were going up like a spiral when times started getting tough, going up even without stopping, in the meantime misery had begun to strike children - harassment, exclusion, physical misery, material, moral. <sep> <sep> And we find political parties important, because we know that "politics" itself is really the means for us to confront and change power. <sep> <sep> Enemy of an enemy, the CEB has ended up producing more than 60% of nuclear power with IPPs, which depend on coal, and a little bagasse. <sep> <sep> 2-3 men say, "Abe, we will send him a stronger death message." Tonight, they go to send a few bites on his three-wheeled vehicle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Membership in branches may have a particular interest in a society, in a land dispute, in a specific activity. <sep><sep> So, you have another form of corruption where MMM, which is supposed to help us get out of this corruption problem, it, it is already in the same kind of trouble, together with MSM, which MSM and Travaays have manipulated at Medpoint. <sep><sep> Krishna Thirapathi, who launched this website to talk about it in the Metisaz program on MBC Radio tonight. <sep><sep> If we find ourselves in Mauritius, with more than 50,000 abandoned arpents of land, well, then it is a problem. <sep><sep> Lalit is launching a boycott campaign against products from Israel. <sep><sep> And certainly not just a governmental program appearing just before an election, nor is it an emanation in the head of the party, nor a list like when buying ration cards. <sep><sep> The Mauritian Creole language as a medium of instruction will help to facilitate the learning process in schools and also make bright children even brighter when they learn in their mother tongue. <sep><sep> Events on Diego Garcia today in 2004 show the advantages of what is called DIALECTIC. <sep><sep> The first has developed a Charter on Food Security, a truly extraordinary work. <sep><sep> To register, you can call 208-2132 or send an email to lptmail@intnet.mu <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a discussion on the nature of the altermondialist movement which is essentially a movement of resistance against capitalist liberation and which consists of all kinds of struggles, once well scattered. <sep><sep> This government is proposing Rs 23 billion (Rs23,000,000,000) in its "Road Map" to restrict the sugar industry, and this restriction is mainly based on widespread destruction. <sep><sep> So we find that the Lalit militant activists have acted on the basis of our political program in the women's movement allowing what today, this one. <sep><sep> When there is a disagreement between 2 groups, there is no democratic way to resolve this disagreement. <sep><sep> Immediately after we found out the Res Communism and its Declaration through the reaction of the Prime Minister accusing the British of 'hypocritical maintenance' and announcing that the Mauritian government is beginning the process of having IAEA inspections on Diego García under the Pelindaba Treaty. <sep><sep> But what is most serious this time is when De L’Estrac declared that France will be able to control the Indian Ocean because of its colony in Reunion in an interview with Le Mauricien on August 22, 1982. <sep><sep> all these have been tailored together - through a series of Vigil and Manifestation with petitions and letters - to be vigilant, to a certain degree. <sep><sep> For example, they encourage people to mobilize on issues such as how many DWC staff cases are licensed, the percentage of people to be subsidized for SC and HSC exams, corruption, fraud, etc. <sep><sep> * There are challenges in major infrastructure projects such as Bagatelle Dam and metro-light rail, despite big announcements year after year. <sep><sep> When we make proposals, it is not only about allocating 2 plots and planting a fruit tree, our proposals also include agricultural reform. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The first major event in this debate was in 1982. <sep><sep> Furthermore, it's online. The other publication in 2012 was in the Liv Roz, Current Political Situation, where LALIT was involved? <sep><sep> Let everyone, their grandparents and children, come again. <sep><sep> We mention a few: Mohunparsad Bhurtun, Henri Favori, Claude Chiffone, Jocelyn Louise, Patrick Ramdhony, Khal Torabally, Edouard Maunique, Noel Allas, Vidya Golam, Richard Sedley Assonne, Anil Gopal, Rishy Bukoree, Vijay Naraidoo, Marcel Poinen, Ramesh Ramdoyal, Lorens Sofi, George Legallant, Rama Poonoosamy, Michel Ducasse, Eshan Abdool Raman, Dany Bastien, Rashid Bundhoo, Rowin Naraidoo, Lindsey Collen, Bam Cuttayen, Alain Fanchon, Jeanne Gerval Arrouf, Rajni Lallah, Alain Muneean, Renee Asgarally, Tahir Birbhay, Loga Virahsawmy, Shyam Ramgoolam, Emmanuel Richon, Joe Seetohul, Umar Timol, Shawkat Toorawa, Deepak Bookhun, Pushpa Lallah, Shenaz Patel, Kamini Ramphul, Azize Asgarally, and others. <sep><sep> And with each decrease in income and at the same time as the reorganization of working hours, it is the family that will be most affected. <sep><sep> There is also a new incentive to translate texts from other languages into Creole. <sep><sep> But intellectually, it is above all their intellectual strength that it will sell. <sep><sep> Recall how other authorities have used all sorts of repressive and physical-sanitary control measures to corner the dalpuri market in Port Louis. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we do not just take this kind of idea in our heads, nor in a stand, nor do we put it as a good idea from the past. <sep><sep> Why is there so much pressure on why Lindsey Collen has done so? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> From that day on, he and his mother were always together and taking care of the house, going to wash clothes at the river, cutting grass to feed the goats, taking care of the banana plantation, taking care of the poultry, and doing small-scale banana and sweet potato business. <sep><sep> Now, with regard to health matters, our Conference starts on the 30th of October. <sep><sep> During the congress, Lalit militants had the opportunity to discuss the various issues that affect Rodrigues and Mauritius. <sep><sep> These three representatives have said that all this happened as a result of the embarrassing secrecy and grotesque manipulation that the Zini and British government carried out to forcibly remove all the inhabitants of these islands during the period from 1965 to 1971. <sep><sep> Jeremy Corbyn, British MP (not yet confirmed because he is a Deputy, it depends on his parliamentary work). <sep><sep> Then CSG-S launched a march in Port Louis, where they claimed they had "more people". <sep><sep> Most of the families, he said, work as laborers and workers for state-run companies in Agalega. <sep><sep> Today, PMSD and MSM have become the 2 parties representing the interests of different sections of the bourgeoisie, controlled by a kind of intellectual bourgeoisie and in business, small entrepreneurs and staunch defenders of the capitalist system. <sep><sep> At the same time, they threaten workers in France that they will be replaced with workers from other countries when they demand their rights. <sep><sep> The slave workers ate in the fernwar culture with their dying bodies at the same time a seed of the new life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The war was also fuelled by the Zini State - a country that was involved in all this, a country that was acting and always acting as a reseller, a country that was building its military base up. <sep><sep> What is even more worrying is the fact that MBC continuously takes sides against the firmly established government of Mauritius in the Zini Nation - without even noticing it! <sep><sep> This has allowed the use of Creole language as a medium as well as English and French for this course. <sep><sep> This same politician believes that the people do not ask him questions when Paul Berenger says he is meeting with Pravind Jugnauth to discuss electoral reform? <sep><sep> Meanwhile, PMXD has managed to achieve a very difficult feat, he has brought about the reunification of PMSD, PMXD and MR. <sep><sep> Ally Hosenbokus presented the Lalit campaign for the election in No.3: <sep><sep> This goes against the best loser system, and he pulled it off. <sep><sep> and in the absence of a true trajectory towards democracy and socialism, in this phase of the current flu act, the Islamists are beginning to raise their heads. <sep><sep> but the reality is that the press is controlled by the same class that currently controls MMM, meaning a bourgeois and petite-bourgeois section that is strong in Rose Hill and Beau Bassin, so the press and MMM share all the same interests. <sep><sep> We need a strong government to create a balance where people can find work with dignity and where there will be no environmental destruction, instead of leading the economy towards Integrated Resort Schemes and tourist development. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Sam returned from the Summer University, he met comrades from LALIT, Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen and he stayed with them. <sep> <sep> Now, the French sun has baptized the land, he also, but he has to work with 30 years of experience, plus. <sep> <sep> and at the same time, organizing to get legislative measures that enforce more equality, while pointing out the limitations to equality possible in the capitalist system. <sep> <sep> We also have a program that promotes the use of mother tongues to learn science, geography, mathematics, history, and all other subjects in school. <sep> <sep> Pravind Jugnauth said he's doing it for MSM. <sep> <sep> And see what happened when there was a debate on electoral reform. <sep> <sep> You will find that a request, could contain different dynamics. <sep> <sep> Last night was a bit like a generous gift that the Lagoons received. <sep> <sep> There was a journalist who was caught sneaking around in the Park, when the public didn't have access. <sep> <sep> Postscript, Ganga took a photo of his mom lovingly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We were on guard against the deception and political trickery of the bourgeoisie and its government (whichever among these two blocks that wins the election); we also exposed the unjust repression of the working class by a coalition government. <sep><sep> The police were pursuing them for a demonstration that the DWC workers and their union CAWU had organized in front of the Government Hotel. <sep><sep> But, here we found that TUTF, it indeed becomes a reinforcement of bureaucracy in the union, relative to union members. <sep><sep> *Only provide funding if the establishment agrees to intercrop all its sugarcane fields with food production. <sep><sep> Everyone needed to work together for national reconstruction. <sep><sep> The MMM/MSM/PMSD block split and PMSD joined the government. <sep><sep> At the same time, keeping a vision of a society where there will be no house servant but which Liliane considered a remnant of a slave society. <sep><sep> More emphasis is placed on LALIT's program on Ecology, Education, Health, Family, Freedom, workers' rights, renewable energy, and more on an alternative economy. <sep><sep> An IWPS member had to intervene with the organization in Israel so that they remember the weapon they cannot hold: the nuclear bomb. <sep><sep> But what's more important, the transformation of agricultural land into buildings implies that we have less cultivable land that can be used for our food security. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now with Pelindaba, nuclear as having a base in Diego, it becomes illegal. <sep><sep> To make sure we are proposing that each primary school in a region receives a first allocation of schools in the area for children who did not pass the CPE. <sep><sep> So, I suppose the role of an activist today is to convince a majority of working class, where it meets it, of the necessity of abolishing a class society. <sep><sep> The responsibility of the Zini government is not only its diplomatic complicity, but also because it limits its main financial support and its main provider of weapons and other military equipment. <sep><sep> We have developed several new demands for the working class corresponding to the new era today. <sep><sep> The penury is causing an increase in basic nutrition prices never before encountered. <sep><sep> When he was fifteen, one day his mother told him that there was a good family in the Gonndouana plant living in a village on the coast that had made a demand for their son who had just received a good banana and was working as a government school teacher. <sep><sep> I knew we could fight against this system. <sep><sep> While it promotes the production of a non-food product, in favor of sugar cane. <sep><sep> Where his laundry had a small mess with a tap and a sink inside. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you were a wealthy man, honestly, wealth capital running out, what would you do? <sep><sep> This is very important because in the Budget 2004-5 Pravind Jugnauth who was the Minister of Finance MSM, along with Paul Bérenger, Prime Minister MMM, had already introduced the same concept 'targeting'. <sep><sep> Their opposition parties, but their parties that defend, they too, like the Government, an ultra-liberal policy. <sep><sep> When you are inviting someone, what system is changing the environment. <sep><sep> An American, for example, who is investing in London, he starts a company here in Offshore Mauritius, then he can choose tax in London, either here. <sep><sep> At the same time, the Church encouraged Priests and organizations in its diocese to organize meetings with religious figures, launch a campaign against oriental languages, and promote communalism. <sep><sep> Here are 3 of the points on the Lalit program in this partial election. <sep><sep> Yet, what we hear them say, there has been no internal debate in their party. <sep><sep> In brackets, it is worth recalling that the first case of a member of JUSTICE, long before JUSTICE was born, was in 1979. <sep><sep> But despite all these shortcomings, the union reminds us that it is the only shield that workers have against bosses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The starting question is: why is the British doing what he is doing? <sep><sep> And also, to understand the enormity of his behavior, the article signed by LALIT to which Jack Bizlall seemed to react. <sep><sep> where the police are supposed to investigate the police, where the Special Mobile Forces have a monopoly on pursuit, where the current institutions cannot guarantee against police violence, when JUSTICE has spoken out, something has changed, either starting its process without anything. <sep><sep> So, when people talk about "electoral reform" today, they are supposed to be talking about the punishment of the system that we inherited from Independence, which we described above. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, in the para-state sector, there has been a lot of repression since the PT was appointed chief. <sep><sep> Berenger himself has an ultra-liberal policy - everyone knows that. <sep><sep> But in any case, he unfortunately re-energizes the old political "will" to keep the BLS safe, when there is clearly ambiguity from the Human Rights Committee as to whether the 1972 census should be updated. <sep><sep> There are also points to consider on food security in this debate. <sep><sep> The weather was nice and the time was passing. <sep><sep> About Zarm Massif Destruction, Rumsfeld (4) talks about 3 possibilities: what 'we know we know' e.g what Iraq is developing nuclear energy, what 'we know we don't know'. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have taken a service to go in the direction of Hares. <sep><sep> Particularly nowadays there is a new movement against this capitalist globalization. <sep><sep> We cannot forget the case of Mrs. Cindy Legallant who benefited from VIP facilities at Plaisance Airport, through a delegate introducing a suitcase with more than 22,000 Subutex tablets. <sep><sep> But, in this form, it cannot offer an alternative. <sep><sep> It does not help, nor is it based on anything other than superficiality of our individual vision. <sep><sep> Then the worker placed him outside in the courtyard when James Burty David was Minister of Education. <sep><sep> In certain times, employees understand that if we want to reduce work problems, we need to organize ourselves to reduce it on our own. <sep><sep> Victims of police violence who have had the courage to speak out in action with Nitin Chinien. <sep><sep> Political reality that is clearly beyond our control at least in the short term, while the "subjective factors" it means all issues where we, ourselves, by our own will, analysis, organization, program and political work, can do. <sep><sep> Rosemay told me that I am getting too angry, there is a problem in it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> NTUC has split into two, and CSG-Solidarite (FPU, FTU, GWF, RWF, plus Rezistans and Alternativ and Muvman Premye Me) have gone in different directions. <sep><sep> The debate on Compensation for Chagossians in 1982 by the PTr government and later by MMM/PSM, the decision to allow the resettlement of Diego Garcia and for Mauritians to work on the Diego Garcia base in 1983, a decision taken by the MSM/PTr/PMSD government under Gaetan Duval's pressure. <sep><sep> The standard of living for workers and common people was much lower then and life was tough. <sep><sep> The Labour Party from 1968 to 2011, has a superficial anti-imperialist discourse, especially on the international level. <sep><sep> When repression of the mother tongue occurred, it is important to note that the development of that language (mother tongue, native language) was impeded. <sep><sep> We need to utilize agricultural land in Mauritius to produce food, and we have been saying this since the 1980s. <sep><sep> In the LALIT INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR on the theme: "ALTERNATIVE ECONOMY", on the 25th of June 2006 at the Horl LPT, GRNW, Porlwi. <sep><sep> A young girl who worked at a hotel for 15 days explained how tough the job was. <sep><sep> It was a Social Alliance Government that repealed 2 laws that had been in use for years, the Employment Rights Act and the Employment Relations Act, which were aimed to weaken the working class and unions in relation to employers. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam's government continues to refuse to go to The Hague. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As observers, we can see that the political situation that seems to be unfolding and how the politics in Mauritius are being conducted, it is evidently the cartoonists. <sep><sep> If you are a child 5 years old in Mauritius speaking French like a child in France speaking French, where in France the parents are talking to him. <sep><sep> He has changed the relationship of power between the employer and the union during negotiations to renew a collective agreement. <sep><sep> The work that we will be doing in these 3 days of Congress, is purely reflective of the themes that I have mentioned. <sep><sep> And for the record, what you report, it exists. <sep><sep> The second problem we have, is the improper use of European money for Blueprint and VRS. <sep><sep> Once we have explained the differences, when the campaign we have conducted has brought about a thorough transformation, attitudes have changed. <sep><sep> Here, we see what has happened, they have voted for 11 resolutions. <sep><sep> Which, "Yes, we are strong, we will continue!" "We will continue until we win!" Then, in this Grand Meeting, make a voluntary contribution, one rupee, two rupees. <sep><sep> And above all, the misery, even under the mountains behind Bosonz. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Waed Ghonin has publicly apologized for his role. <sep><sep> Our main focus for this year is to implement a work strategy for a sustainable plan concerning the economic problems due to the crisis in the textile and security industry. <sep><sep> When there are more incentives, it helps the employer to improve our prosperity. <sep><sep> Currently, some are using corn, beans, peas, sugar cane, and other crops to produce bio-fuel, which, depending on, is not a renewable and sustainable energy and still less a green and clean energy. <sep><sep> Similar to what has been done, we believe there is no connection between the "economy" and the "environment". <sep><sep> To criticize this deviation towards nationalism, Mauritianism, and patriotism which has made MMM a rather communal and pro-imperialist party. <sep><sep> Therefore, we must determine that the enemy is "patriarchy". <sep><sep> Under a large lavender tree, the three Sadhus slept so deeply that neither the roosters nor the colorful birds could wake them up. <sep><sep> Although they seem to be in all these parties, they are different kinds of people, in color, in symbols, but what they have in common is one kind of politics. <sep><sep> We are waiting for a salty space to deliverance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the beginning of 2004, Prime Minister Berenger announced that the country was facing an "economic crisis and moments of great change". <sep><sep> We, we had to get on the boat because of our women and children. <sep><sep> The CIA funded MLC, especially the MLC advisory council and the PT-PMSD government in various ways through GWF. <sep><sep> That day he went to China for a special reason. <sep><sep> On the 15th of September, unfortunately, Rima (not Auguste)." <sep><sep> His "League for Socialist Alternation" (LALIT) had financial troubles this year. <sep><sep> He has already shown too much representation in the Government and the State. <sep><sep> at the same time, there is another party of people who, in favor of a return to the capitalist system, are a little aggressive, but they too, have their political party; <sep><sep> LALIT has already filed a case against radio stations during the 2005 election campaign, as they have completely boycotted LALIT during the campaign. <sep><sep> After that, we had an energy crisis with soaring petrol/fuel prices. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As soon as we finished the electoral pre-election campaign, Minister Sithanen found a possibility for compensation, and he found it in January. <sep><sep> There is a Review, website, and we go to visit members. <sep><sep> What are we doing in the General Elections costing? <sep><sep> The UN provides weapons to Israel and removes its veto against all resolutions of the UN Security Council condemning Israel. <sep><sep> Indeed, not only the international media seems to have a problem, but also in Mauritius, LALIT and MLF made all the media aware of the launch. <sep><sep> It is one of the greatest obstacles to the liberation movement that I have encountered in my life. <sep><sep> And this has continued since the 1910s, under the regime of 'wage slavery'. <sep><sep> It is a matter that we have constantly reflected on. <sep><sep> PMSD has launched a campaign for all those who were born in Mauritius or whose Morisian parents have an absolute right to return to Mauritius even if in the meantime they have taken on another nationality. <sep><sep> Poor people and workers in the US government tend to think that their votes have no meaning, and Barack Obama has won a victory against this cynicism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So we have a crisis that the capitalist system produces, and this time there is no escape. <sep> In a way it protects and guarantees dictatorship. <sep> In order to have a session on the use of design, comics, in political literature. <sep> Then in 2005, we organized a great circulation of our 240-page book on the Bestluzer Commonist System, and in 2010, we held a series of open meetings that allowed us to deepen our ideas on general electoral reform. <sep> In the 1970s, workers found PT and PMSD full of contradictions, in the name of the bourgeoisie, so during their struggle, the working class created a new party, MMM, which often visited the political power, and it visited it with the idea of the "vanguard working class" in an alliance with other oppressed classes. <sep> They do not understand why I felt secure in their presence, meaning they naturally understand the deep feelings of love, feminine anxiety. <sep> In Leh, the BJP lost, and the Congress came back to power, when in the United States, it was Bush who reported the presidential election. <sep> The literature is proposing an agricultural diversification on a large scale together with the value-added transformation industry. <sep> Often in the literature of women's liberation, on many issues relating to women's liberation, we have to confront extremist anti-family ideologies concerning labor and contraception or divorce and marriage. <sep> He also said that while someone had gone to Palestine, he found an immense resistance of stateliness: men, women, old people, young people, children are taking up arms against the State of Israel. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have cleverly served "pirate" as an excuse, and are waiting for Seychelles to panic when Lehmann Bros goes bankrupt. <sep><sep> Yesterday, there is a flaw in the strategy at another level. <sep><sep> All this gives an idea in which the government chaos is. <sep><sep> MMM and PMSD must also be careful if they are not mocking another ridiculous task: Like in Mauritius, there is a certain number fixed "drug and violence" (not 87 individuals, nor). <sep><sep> Without looking at our campaign and our program as something that extends everywhere for analysis and demand to be in another. <sep><sep> During the twenty-five days, he split between the black cloud and positive thinking. <sep><sep> On Wednesday, Palmir and Lamek, the workers will come to work, without cutting corners, Basin zone section. <sep><sep> It will strengthen the heart of the sector and the identity that wants to restrict the Creole language to the level of an "ancestral language". <sep><sep> For a long time, whether it was the Berenger-Jugnauth government or the Ramgoolam government, the boss was supporting in order to impose this kind of law. <sep><sep> Now we must see if "Remake" to go back in the fridge! Calm down, by all means, Ramgoolam will have to find a way out of this dilemma in which he finds himself kind. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Interesting discussion between a representative from Doctors of the World and a family reunion. <sep><sep> If L'Estrac and his comrades do not do this, then at least they will exhaust a "power base" that can negotiate with Navin Ramgoolam, either before the next general election or after. <sep><sep> It seems that this flood zone has worsened, and it is possible that the 7 houses in Hares that received demolition notices are being affected by this new decree of military administration. <sep><sep> This year, Celine and Tamby had their first child. <sep><sep> Different branches have started to focus on 2 films about Cuba, the RSP branch in Sydney has given LALIT one about a Cuban doctor working in Timor-Leste, and Timor-Leste students studying in Cuba. <sep><sep> Life on the planet could become more difficult, particularly for species like mammals, which are highly sensitive to various environmental changes such as chemical, thermal, etc. <sep><sep> It realized that its surroundings were becoming polluted, and Trousanfon was filled with pollution. <sep><sep> There was a single firm that was controlling the seeds of this variety that they were trying to introduce. <sep><sep> It is a political party, but due to their process and relationships, they have managed to survive the dictatorship of Mubarak by operating in mosques, in Madrasas, behind mosques. <sep><sep> And also, he can never express that knowledge and understanding as if each individual expresses that "most knowledge" that exists in a community. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the year 2007, we witnessed conflicts between Sithanen and Council Minister Jeetah and the Minister of Labour, Mr. <sep><sep> Firstly, there is no unique solution to this issue anymore, and secondly, there are provocations resulting in fractures, so to speak. <sep><sep> this led to the chronology of LALIT, a timeline, until 2008. <sep><sep> We have had both peaceful protests and civil unrest here, from a simple demonstration here to a civil uprising there. <sep><sep> with a magnitude of 5.0 in the region of Guam approximately 79 miles from Haganta, the capital of Guam. <sep><sep> The government was previously trying to replace the IRA law with a law that gives employers the power to ensure peace. <sep><sep> Conversely, introducing English and French with a good basis of Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> Often in the past, when you ask a worker in the Free Zone if they are in a union, if they say yes, they will say in the “Soodhun Union”, or alternatively today they will say in the “Subron Union”. <sep><sep> A program is a continuing thing that we are beginning to understand. <sep><sep> What do you say when Right now Amnesty Mauritius, the organizations that claim to defend human rights, liaise with private companies. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They built a total monopoly while workers were creating this new system. <sep> <sep> We are making precise references to a capitalist section, namely an investor and businessman section, who believe they can use detailed accounts to help them compete with the financial power of the oligarchy and other major historical capitalists. <sep> <sep> So this year, we found the importance of a political "strategist". <sep> <sep> Not only did L'Express mention that the CTSP did not invite the MMM, but today, March 13, an editorial is saying that Berenger should retire as the leader of the MMM. <sep> <sep> Jean Suzanne, CEO of Infinity, who advised Prime Minister Ramgoolam, benefited from Rs135 million from Sithanen's Stimulus Package and the government has spent Rs375 million to buy Infinity Tower so that Infinity can continue to operate. Where did all that money go? <sep> <sep> And what we are finding, to some extent, is what we are doing today, a collective version of a work that a group of people are doing. <sep> <sep> The Enron scandal has become infamous as an example of how greed has been used to put a class of corrupt leaders in power in the USA. <sep> <sep> When asked why there have been strikes in the security industry, then why there have not been strikes, most people never really say. <sep> <sep> This, in my opinion, is the greatest interest in the production of this 'reader', where its content stands out. <sep> <sep> I observe the sanctions in life in this world as I have explanations from there; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> GRAFI LARMONI represents a significant advancement for the Mauritian Creole language, and it is triggering an even more dynamic process. <sep><sep> The editor had to provide space where Kazern, the Police Commissioner, and his team could respond to the article criticizing the PT-PMSD government. <sep><sep> During the 1960s-80s, particularly in the world of ambassadors, everyone experienced in "international relations," everyone in the more political section of the United Nations knew that Chagos was part of Mauritius, that Mauritius was claiming it, and that Mauritius was planning to regain it. <sep><sep> Globally, there is an atmosphere of Bush reigns, not just the end of a political reign, but the beginning of the end for the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Brigitte Yeung from the Himalayas, Mohau Pheko experienced in the WTO from South Africa, and also renowned women from Argentina, Kenya, Lenn, Slovenia, and Israel. <sep><sep> There are colleges from Form 1-5 and colleges from Form 6. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said that no matter how much soap is created, we will always fall short, we will never finish with a deficit. <sep><sep> We had a very successful year, despite the French parasites participating in official independence celebrations. <sep><sep> The heatwave was suffocating in a very humid summer. <sep><sep> When we consider it in all its dimensions, we realize that, fundamentally, it also perpetuates a dominant-submissive relationship between white and black. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the year 2000, an electrician contested the community candidate Lalit had put forward as a candidate and brought us to the Supreme Court. <sep><sep> According to him, the World Social Forum today is dominated by a special caste in favor of international meetings just for debate, which does not favor mobilization and where there are multinational companies funding its meetings. <sep><sep> Even though they may pretend to be "like LALIT", this caste of workers favors "democratization of the economy" only in the name of the working class and small planters. <sep><sep> Today, the Mauritian government has only until the present year, 2014, to act on preventing the illegal extradition to either Britain or the USA. <sep><sep> Among those present, some are also active in political parties, but they were hesitant to oppose the military base issue. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Berenger, after 1983, has played a role as a political spokesman for minorities. <sep><sep> When the capitalist system is creating disorder in ordinary life. <sep><sep> Education, health, it's not just a service, it's a right. <sep><sep> But in his head, there was a Boss on one side who had privileged contacts with Barrka Saheb, a big political cock on one side with an International Mafia on the other. <sep><sep> He could just, for example, shoot down one government and put another one, the same. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The new behavior is a new way of living that men and women needed to learn together.<sep> <sep> There are former MMM members like Beebeejaun, Abdoollah Hossen, Cader Sayed Hossen.<sep> <sep> The mobilization to go to Chagos has also strengthened the Blair government's extremely unpopular action in its own country: to impose a formal ban, an Order in Council, to prevent Chagosians from returning to Diego Garcia and other Chagos islands.<sep> <sep> We are committed to putting pressure on the Mauritian State to act in practice:<sep> <sep> it has not found another solution other than proposing to refer back to a new census where questions about the community’s way of life are asked.<sep> <sep> And today, in 5 years, when there is a negotiation between MMM and PT for a pre-electoral alliance, they are beginning to use other LALIT actions based on the LALIT program: Diego Garcia and the Kreol language.<sep> <sep> LALIT, and LALIT members, had a key role in creating a grassroots movement that has become the JUSTICE association:<sep> <sep> This was the first national-level institutional work that recognized the Kreol language.<sep> <sep> We expect that after these 3 days, we will have a significant number of people armed to face a difficult situation.<sep> <sep> Similarly, it is the duty of individuals who proceed with Jack Bizlall and also the Executive Committee elected by workers in various unions to criticize him, keep him on track and not let other women become victims of his violence in the future. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The problem of national minority - whether it be cultural or linguistic - can not be resolved positively except through democratic means. <sep> <sep> - A lady is surrounded by a blue cloud and a light shining on her head. <sep> <sep> Even if they are legally required to provide Lalit with a bit of "time", such as after Lalit brought this case before the IBA court with these 4 radios. <sep> <sep> The class from which they originate, individually, is not mentioned. <sep> <sep> Lalit also denounces government methods known as "Bhagwan methods" in elections. <sep> <sep> Surely, however, as in these last 7 years, we will continue to suffer from this massive campaign where they say something very different in public from what is found in the complaints. <sep> <sep> They talk about crisis as if it were a disease that a curse has sent. <sep> <sep> After several atomic explosions, life on the surface became impossible. <sep> <sep> China is increasing its presence in Africa, as well as in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> And in all this, what we need to understand are these expenses, and how contradictory they are to other expenses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Just before him and others resigned from LALiT to join Resistance. <sep><sep> There could be an "exception," there could be a "specified date that is not too far away." <sep><sep> When you analyze the situation, you will find that there is a familiar pattern in such positions and then you can measure the difference that this makes. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee also noted that the government has chosen to hold an official ceremony in Plas Gaetan Duval in Mahebourg. <sep><sep> So the call is for the decriminalization of abortion, it is a dynamic of liberation at the same time for women and for class equality as well. <sep><sep> We also find ways in which these dynamics contribute to class equality and women's liberation. <sep><sep> For example, the Central Bank had stopped the depreciation of the rupee and now, despite the capitalist pressures from the France Zone and establishments that are seeking more rupees for change, the rupee is appreciating. <sep><sep> However, ERiA and EReA have also become recognized as "negotiators" within the trade union. <sep><sep> In the village of Kifr Hares, we are informed that last night there was a burglary and a curfew has been imposed. <sep><sep> The privatization policy of the MMM-MSM Government is threatening the livelihoods of many civil servants; the metro plan is causing a lot of dissatisfaction among transportation workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Also, there is a large campaign, supported by the government itself, to close down the National Transport Corporation rather than improving it. <sep><sep> In a bidze discourse, we do not find any political will for the development of the new agro-industry sector, a sector for food security. <sep><sep> Together, we can see how the winner-takes-all system is perverting democracy in this country. <sep><sep> In terms of analysis and debate, we have had much analysis on self-proclaimed "logos", particularly 2. <sep><sep> They think the state means a system where there are institutions like Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, ministers, judges, the police, civil service. <sep><sep> But Marx has always said that there will never be a "utopia" or a form of socialism in the future. <sep><sep> Calling it redundancy, voluntary retirement scheme, is reorganizing, all kinds of restrictions. <sep><sep> Yes, settlement means the same as colony - it refers to a map in the wilderness. <sep><sep> Now, it favors collective, workers' front, movement without restrictions. <sep><sep> It forms part of an international network called “NO U.S.” <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another difficulty affecting all individuals in LALIT is not just the youth, but also the non-electoralist political struggle we bring. <sep>

Minister Deerpalsing not only bribed politicians, but he was also convicted in court because he insulted hospital employees. <sep>

Social class is essentially defined by the objective relationship a person (or a family) has with means of survival. In the capitalist era, it could be said that the relationship one has with the means that serve to produce everything. <sep>

When SILU-UASI meeting finishes, about 4 o'clock, then there will be a GWF meeting, which means delegates from all GWF unions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even the "op-ed" column (opinion-editorial) in the Western world where independent thought is much more difficult, they are all admitting that it is possible that we need to question the capitalist system. <sep><sep> At the Kampala Commonwealth Heads of States Conference, Prime Minister Brown met. <sep><sep> And every time they say they will fix things, they bring even more destruction into the system. <sep><sep> Cassam Uteem said: We must close the military base on Diego Garcia! <sep><sep> Why do they want Berenger to be a suitable location for the base? <sep><sep> But when Pierre explained to him what Timi was trying to do, he decided to give Tantinn Timi a good push. <sep><sep> But today, a lot of money is going directly into the capitalist system due to a serious public infrastructure breakdown (because the government is refusing public works contracts). <sep><sep> In the port of Port Mathurin, there is an industrial fishing boat that has been operating for several months. <sep><sep> The Commissions that have functioned this year are the Trade Union Commission (which unifies all workers, all unions, all federations), our Environmental Commission and Ecology Commission. <sep><sep> And at the same time, all women present have pledged to inform the population about this progress, so that we can confront and reduce the violence suffered at the hands of the police after a violent incident. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT is not only an internationalist political party, but also has a long history of internationalist struggle. <sep> This is the beginning of a response to Comrade Jane. <sep> In this paper, we will briefly look at the current international context, the types of responses present in the face of the current international capitalist crisis, and the different forms of internationalist response in history. <sep> He was together with a group of other Lalit members, when he arrived at the Government School in Lari Seeneevassen. <sep> Jabaljas: System, I can make an appeal at the coal plant where some central that is already burning coal and polluting our environment: there are six of them. <sep> Are the verbal attacks by N. Ramgoolam just a tactic to divert attention from the systemic crisis that is devastating workers and affecting Mauritian society as a whole? <sep> When the MMM-PSM came into power, it signaled a Historic Block, which led to the crisis that erupted 9 months after the MMM-PSM came to power in 1982. <sep> Since its inception, the PMSD has acted as the representative of the big bourgeoisie and the most reactionary section of the bourgeoisie concentrated in B. Bassin-R. Hill. <sep> FOR FOOD SECURITY, WE MUST GROW FOOD on the tilled land. <sep> separate them from the passivity that characterizes the working class the most (because we are forced to sell our labor force, willing or not, and this makes us relatively powerless). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Because they do not want to accept that the government has a thousand ways to spend that money other than giving it to people who earn more than 17,000 rupees a month, except in the pension fund. <sep><sep> In Palestine, a militant from LALIT who went to West Bank, went to the sea border with Gaza to show solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people. <sep><sep> Without Lalit and the Movement for the Liberation of Families taking part in it, without the Fraternal Organization taking part. <sep><sep> But certain things that Ashok Subron and Alain Genave in Rodrigues and Devianand Narrain did, they were damaging to the credibility that Lalit has regarding the labor movement. <sep><sep> This is because the blood-sucker capital does not invest directly by the Government, which only takes people to work. <sep><sep> The ceremony will be presided over by the leader of LALIT, Alain Ah-Vee, who went to Palestine as a volunteer in 2004 in the sea protests of the Miray Apartheid that the State of Israel has illegitimately constructed. <sep><sep> During the Asian crisis, the IMF and the World Bank have said "let banks go bankrupt." <sep><sep> He explained how there are many organizations with different tendencies and traditions actively countering the US occupation in Afghanistan. <sep><sep> Clearly, the Workers' Party would have had an advantage for it, as a party. <sep><sep> But there are things that the state of Israel is reconsidering - not knowing if it will reroute the sea before cleaning it up. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We can elect candidates in certain constituencies, but not all. <sep> <sep> - Since when has love become a curse? - Love? No, it's not love. <sep> <sep> That is, a group, a new pro-LALIT way, analyzes the way his enterprise, his sector where he works functions; it analyzes the way his union leadership leads the trade union struggle. <sep> <sep> and it strengthens the struggle for socialism in an extraordinary way. <sep> <sep> We have learned that the army has passed and has placed a red cross on the doorposts facing the houses across the village entrance. <sep> <sep> But, you know what "cooperation" in a license that allows production to be marketed. <sep> <sep> This has taken different political arrangements with the ruling party, especially with the majority of landowners and small landowners. <sep> <sep> - Hey Karen! Wow, I heard you were but a little far. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, there are journalists who have just finished circling the head of the military, soldiers and informants who are responsible for assassinating, torturing and arresting opponents. <sep> <sep> When the meeting is over, when we are drinking tea, then, with cunning, with whatever is still present, and with what is in store, will be marked on a piece of paper, of what we believe that the results at hand will be joked about. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I will be able to provide my friends who wanted to understand olive detail more when I have a better understanding of the production process. <sep><sep> PAL - It is a manufacturing, rather regional, entity that has taken a position in favor of the use of Creole in the Assembly and against the communal bilateral decision-making system. <sep><sep> A person who works on a machine, with a yellow report, all of us, all of us are workers. <sep><sep> And there we will make a distinction between the 2, between MMM and Workers. <sep><sep> On the Workers side, even if the employed worker manages to get through the bureaucratic barrier of the Ministry of Labor, and his case goes to Court, and he manages to get his case, whatever he may get, it is the Magistrate who will decide. <sep><sep> Sometimes they create platforms for Nita Deerpalsing, Assirvaden, Navin Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> But in all these establishments, all workers fall under the worker label and they all get the same pay and conditions as based on the award. <sep><sep> We know that before the Assembly on the 4th day for example, there were meetings at Ashok Subron's house to establish a list of people who will march with him. <sep><sep> It could not be brought by people who assist in the Parliament to vote for a law. <sep><sep> But we know that MMM does not have an economic or social alternative program, different from the Social Alliance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Can a woman be part of a political party, be a candidate, but be sure that the party in which they belong does not have a program in favor of women's liberation? <sep><sep> She believes that protecting herself is when she flies so that she doesn't get caught where she should, keeps her belongings, etc. <sep><sep> It is the trade union that was financing this party, because the trade union realized that they needed to take political action. <sep><sep> A week later, La Voix Kreol newspaper came out with a big front-page headline, announcing a major book crisis. <sep><sep> On the electoral side, it wants to have the right to elect a constituency to revoke its deputy; the right to overturn the Ministry, and even the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> This has implications on central administration, and in turn, on new recruitment. <sep><sep> It created quite a tense moment between residents and the police. <sep><sep> In the past, we found this exercise to be a waste of time, which only creates the illusion that the Minister has taken into consideration the interests of everyone before drawing up his budget. <sep><sep> Therefore, we need to identify and be wary of communal mobilizations, because they will obstruct the fight for the liberation of humanity from capitalist oppression. <sep><sep> The hunger strike continued to fuel the hunger strike at Zardin Konpayni. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In that case, instead of seizing the opportunity presented by the economic crisis to reorient the Mauritius economy, he only takes advantage of it. <sep><sep> For Sithanen, the jobs that Mauritians should have are working as servants, gardeners, childminders or drivers. <sep><sep> The President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has finally submitted a formal request for Palestinian recognition before the UN Security Council. <sep><sep> Even if there is skepticism, he has felt the sense of achievement. <sep><sep> This conference is intended to bring together activists from around the world to analyse the roles of multinational companies and states in various forms of oppression, drawing on their experience of warfare in different countries and on a global scale. <sep><sep> However, it is very complicated and there are many debates on this. <sep><sep> when there is a large anti-capitalist movement, they cannot help to provide a direction because they no longer have a socialist program, but only an anti-capitalist program, as well as a spontaneous movement. <sep><sep> During the 70s and 80s PMSD was campaigning under the name "Black Power" and using expressions like 'Joe', 'nation' only to encourage identification and regrouping on the basis of ethnicity. <sep><sep> Another problem we have been encountering lately is that there is a phase where, when we are in a process controlled by the State, there are weaknesses outside. <sep><sep> Recently, there was a phenomenon of 'Wanted' where they exist and declare that 15,000 people have signed their petition for a grand demonstration in Port-Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The sea ​​will reach Jerusalem on 19th September 2004. <sep> And we realize that an electoral system is a means. <sep> Its location, its taking control must be very interesting, but as a socialist strategy, it is wrong. <sep> The police lost its case, and they were all acquitted. <sep> It is not an opinion to find it "good" or "not good". <sep> When a capitalist looks at a worker, he says, "It's a useful bug for me!" <sep> In Palestine also, I get the impression that it's all the same. <sep> And also because the IRA ensures state control over the union through the Registrar. <sep> It always refuses legitimate expenses that the cutting-edge machines cut. <sep> What is strange, what is the majority of these unions affiliated with the FPU. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After 2009, and this for many years just LALIT was warning people that after 2009, there are neither price guarantees nor quotas. <sep><sep> We find an electoral system where between 2 general elections, one is elected in a constituency with no control over its representative who simply elects him. <sep><sep> As everyone knows, Creole is used by all Mauritians in everyday life: <sep><sep> MMM is corrupt in the way it criticizes corruption. <sep><sep> In Budrus after several months of demonstrations they managed to make the army retreat and redraw the path outside the villages. <sep><sep> This is the term we have used since the beginning of our campaign. <sep><sep> There was a track a peace that was introduced Ragini, Lalit, Mauritius and Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> This was a sting that was buried in his thigh. <sep><sep> He went on to announce in a religious assembly that the government is reconsidering because there was manipulation in the EIA process. <sep><sep> Even when they presented their letter on only 2 evenings, and in some cases, they never informed that LALIT had a candidate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this global campaign for freedom, JUSTICE has also gained more ground. <sep>  <sep> However, as a true servant, through a serious economic plan, there is nothing said. <sep>  <sep> We embody this social division, where politics. <sep>  <sep> In Salfit there is a public park but it's quite rare. <sep>  <sep> The GWF Assembly has reasonably found the second party motion, unacceptable. <sep>  <sep> At the same time, the farmers and their organization are coordinating with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) and the International Women's Peace Service (IWPS) are launching the Olive Harvest campaign 2005 starting on October 15th. <sep>  <sep> This has prevented unfair competition between workers, prevented harsher punishment for the workers, and created a fantastic atmosphere in the workplace. <sep>  <sep> In January 2011, the Cabinet decided to abandon this project. <sep>  <sep> So the presence of international activists is helping to strengthen the Israeli army and police forces against the settlers. <sep>  <sep> Ram Seegobin said that there are many things to transform the security industry, to make it into a sugar industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The colonial state needed enough power to be able to assimilate capital, so that it would have a privileged access to the surplus it produced in its colony. <sep> <sep> Today, MMM gets a good laugh when Berenger accuses Bidze of being "ultra-liberal". <sep> <sep> When, as comrade Lindsey said this morning, we had a bourgeois reign when the capitalist system developed, 200 bananas or so. <sep> <sep> What worries many people today is how to create the new elite in large numbers and in which sector. <sep> <sep> We also have a large percentage of young candidates. <sep> <sep> The labor law, it is against workers, and it is against trade unions. <sep> <sep> All of this is embedded in this class conflict. <sep> <sep> But at the same time, it says that it is possible to "subsume," that is, integrate the best losers into this proportional party system. <sep> <sep> How can he separate these class struggles, defeat was immediate. <sep> <sep> Because there was no food shortage, no money shortage, no surplus, no class inequality, so there was no need for the state. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> From 1959 onwards, the Advance Group has formed a special alliance with the bourgeoisie urban elite, intellectuals, professionals, and especially urban residents. <sep> <sep> This signifies the imposition of a secret ballot, where trade unions are being atomized into individual members. <sep> <sep> When Aziz reached Manann group, he went straight to its leader. <sep> <sep> Due to the reality of repression, colonization, occupation, and military aggression that the Palestinian people have been subjected to, they revolted in 1987 (first Intifada), and in 2000, when the population of Gaza and the West Bank rose up significantly against Israeli arms. <sep> <sep> However, behind a facade that supposedly represents "freedom of expression" and is a "democratic space," many secrets remain hidden. <sep> <sep> The army passed and launched a sonic bomb in the primary schoolyard. <sep> <sep> But, Jean Yves, why did we not send a representative to the Conference hall? <sep> <sep> In his financial and political turbulence, he found only the very last remnants of balance. <sep> <sep> The Finance Minister, Pravind Jugnauth, when Navin Ramgoolam was Prime Minister, bought a clinic for his own family for Rs 144 million. <sep> <sep> In the new law to replace the Labour Act, the Government states it is proposing an unemployment benefit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And the people who understand this game of power and demand, they play the system. <sep> After MMM sold their plans, Lalit de Klas separated in 1982, before the general elections, which is on the 4th of April, to form the LALIT party. <sep> Around 10:00 PM, we heard that the army has been summoned to the State Đirzans and they are relaxing their presence in the village of Jame'en. <sep> Capitalist class, even though it is a small class among the number of people, it has power because they are the masters of the people who are not in this class, they have been expropriated in the past, they have been expelled from the land they used to cultivate. <sep> It is worth noting that all this is happening not only in the strict MMM districts, but also in other places. <sep> This happened in 1979, and there was a similar situation in 1980, a continuation of the same movement. <sep> They are normally listed at the beginning of the state apparatus, in capitalist economy, they set up institutions and have a policy that supposedly gives a certain protection to the working class. <sep> Before and now the governments have used and are using Diego Garcia as a threat to gain economic agreements. <sep> The law must compel the Tablisman to reorganize its sugar cane cartels to allow planter enterprises to intervene in all agricultural lands including the cane. <sep> There have been new elements in the national debate that have made our requests more relevant: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>As Ram has said, an intelligentsia in politics who have become references, they collaborate with common society in order for a group in the prosperous bourgeoisie. <sep><sep>NRB and IRC were there to facilitate and replace the union, in a certain measure. <sep><sep>If you find your conditions unfavorable, instead of collectively seeking a solution together with your comrades, you say “I'm leaving, I'm going to Bel Roz, there's a new recreation center there”. <sep><sep>But they did not have a warrant, so he refused to go with them, and presented himself to the police station at Layn Baraks for arrest on Monday morning. <sep><sep>Once again, I remember, we find ourselves in Cyclone Class III. <sep><sep>In the morning when the sun rises, the reflection of the first rays of sunlight on the olive leaves creates a golden hue. <sep><sep>Cindy Clelie took the floor for the first time in a meeting, and spoke as a member of Lalit who will be voting for the first time in 2005. <sep><sep>The constitution places the responsibility for determining the community, if there is any question, in the hands of the Supreme Court. <sep><sep>Which Minister is responsible for support and has control over these cards? <sep><sep>What will happen to the rights of return and compensation for the millions of Palestinian refugees who were forcibly displaced from Palestine during the Partition in 1948, and when Israel occupied Palestine in 1967? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government should not allow the Republic of Mauritius to become a "haven" for producing "GMO-free guarantees". <sep><sep> To find ourselves (individually, and as a party) all-powerful, is to find ourselves without any power at all. <sep><sep> Many international activists are critiquing global capitalism and are taking a stand to open conferences; among them are writer-activist Arundhati Roy, theorist and political critic Ashish Nandy, founder of Narmada Bachao Andolan and National Alliance of People's Movements, Medha Patkar. <sep><sep> Therefore, this machine in the form of a capitalist capital party, is an instrument of production, thus, it is supposed, in its capitalist form party. <sep><sep> Another small factor is that it too will dilute the labour movement. <sep><sep> When the working class is united, certain leaders are tempted to resort to populism. <sep><sep> And as in 1967, the bourgeoisie prevented a solution that would have put the quality of the economy first, in the face of the crisis in the current economy. <sep><sep> When the coffee is finished, everyone arranges their chairs to form a circle and an informal family meeting begins in the waiting room. <sep><sep> All this will only cost 6 million, when it is spending 500 million for the renovation of the offices of Prime Minister Berenger and President Jugnauth, when the pension of the deputy prime minister that Berenger will receive, amounted to a million per year. <sep><sep> The documents of that time that the British Government declassified and which journalist Henri Marimootoo published in Week-End in 1997, clearly demonstrate the progress we are making. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> I will do a sentence by sentence translation  :

<sep> The same question for certain civil service unions that often invite the Minister to speak at their annual conference. <sep><sep> We have been filled with work force, since the feudal era, slavery, colonization, and up to today in "working for a living" since the boss. <sep><sep> -Defining this working class section that is so transcending the bourgeois ideology - of his class struggle experience - and keeping ties with him, like him, he is always in the working class as a whole. <sep><sep> If these economic problems are not resolved, there is great danger ahead. <sep><sep> After Seattle we have had a second battle, but the struggle for a better world, for a socialist political alternative, is more alive than ever. <sep><sep> It also mentioned how the military zone on Diego Garcia has been so closely guarded as a completely closed and closed place since all journalists. <sep><sep> Account against military bases, against arms production - to expose the permanent war machine mechanism. <sep><sep> Democracy on the work site and freedom for workers, in its contemporary state, are different from the measures we take in the spectrum of businesses in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Politically, the MMM, with its two partners Ashok Jugnauth and Eric Guimbeau, represent more of the people and not just a strict party. <sep><sep> WHO has asked them to conduct a regional survey on mental health and psychological problems due to occupation. Interesting discussion between representatives of Doctors of the World and a family from the region. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We've had a major conflict between the political regime and the historical bourgeoisie, which was based on the security industry and large-scale imports. <sep><sep> Proudhon, also, wrote to a friend from prison. <sep><sep> But at the same time, people are happy to ask LALIT members for their opinions on the issues, or are happy to debate with LALIT members. <sep><sep> Then the IRA and Labour Act would codify this power relationship, where the Government, where the Oppressive Regime would attack the working class and its union. <sep><sep> They reflect the fundamental contradictions in society, and a political party with its program in this society. <sep><sep> A LALIT team announced at a press conference the presentation of a Political Seminar on Strategy to be held over 2 days in Ziyet. <sep><sep> But in a systemic crisis, it multiplies by thousands or millions when you do this. <sep><sep> - 'I have not yet discussed this with my Prime Minister,' Aziz joked with him. <sep><sep> There were indeed thousands of organizations that participated in the Constituent Assembly. <sep><sep> Meaning when you face it squarely, you are only facing a part of a problem in the capitalist system, and you are living only part of a solution to this problem. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We will base our program on freedom. <sep> <sep> Then our members took the initiative to start an All Workers’ Conference, where the Workers' Education brought together all trade union federations to resist the pressure from the IMF, the World Bank, and fight against the pressure for privatization. <sep> <sep> There has been much debate on whether it is not a good strategy for the working class to take power by taking control of the bourgeois state. <sep> <sep> Every time Ramgoolam has the opportunity, he calls for unity, signing contracts elsewhere. What is he saying "sign elsewhere"? <sep> <sep> Today it is important that you all remind each other of what happened with Ashock Jugnauth. <sep> <sep> But one must understand in general that if you want society to progress in the interest of all people, you must control society yourself. <sep> <sep> And these struggles have been going on since the arrival of bourgeois ideology, acting as a whore between political leadership and working-class struggles. <sep> <sep> But, when you look at the December 2010 list, there are quite a few that are not there. <sep> <sep> While identity groups have been active in the press. <sep> <sep> Why are more people moving towards these 2 blocs? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> "Sef delegation had been added to his case file was not claiming but it was more of an explanation. <sep><sep> "Now we come to our second poem 'The River Speaks' written by Alain Muneean. <sep><sep> In the seminar we discussed about the Protocol of the Indian Ocean, and Textile. <sep><sep> They have been very critical in their evaluation of the Government's disastrous "assessment". <sep><sep> Transportation took it 7 hours in the morning, making it one hour in total. <sep><sep> Papa Timi did not place his trust in Balram at all and accepted him because his daughter was relying on him. <sep><sep> Young people everywhere and always the same! When the election for his second term came, Timi realized that there was not the same enthusiasm as before. <sep><sep> And there are representatives of the "identity" political current of Creole and Afro-Creole who are often scratching their heads, sometimes seeking nominations. <sep><sep> It's clear that we do not need to vote for either Pravind Jugnauth or Ashok Jugnauth. <sep><sep> So, we have a constant challenge to fully understand the history and content of our political current. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, for us, we are continuously united: the story of humanity, the philosophy on how reflections can help us, and also, when we want, by our will to build a better society, we can make it work in a way that will succeed. <sep><sep> On the third month, according to their account, they went to see a gynecologist, better than the one in Jericho. <sep><sep> Exactly 20 years ago, there was a book that was causing a stir: A shock in America, a political science professor named Francis Fukuyama published a book he boldly called The End of History. <sep><sep> This week, the European countries are marking 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall as a victory for "freedom of the world". <sep><sep> The problem with this proposition at three levels is that firstly, the competition for the CPE is taking over social control because it will be at the level of a single school. <sep><sep> That is, a single government cannot turn away from a class society. <sep><sep> Today, there are two hundred and fifty activists; there are more of them seeking something. <sep><sep> It is under the current MMM-MSM government that this whole process has been accelerated: rapid mechanization for sugar cane plantations leading to the VRS, where almost 10,000 sugar cane cutters have been dismissed; <sep><sep> First level: For there to be 4 Form 6 colleges more than the existing Form 6 State Colleges with a religious denomination. <sep><sep> It has become a “game” for workers who are waiting for the blueprint/VRS like a counter coup against the Government during the Government/MSPA conflict to protect historical bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, and that is what concerns us in this speech today, we have a minimum number of cans on our side. <sep><sep> Rashid Emrith on one side with his Federation, Seegum has gone to another side. <sep><sep> The education policy that the Ptr-PMXD-MR Government has finally unveiled, it will bring more inequality and will intensify the unhealthy competition that already exists in education. <sep><sep> But, I am also on the youth commission that organizes activities aimed at guiding young people, supporting them. <sep><sep> So, his contribution to the Law Reform Commission, for example, is zero. <sep><sep> Initiated by the United Nations General Assembly, the Brundtland Commission focuses on a definition that is often used in development as "meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". <sep><sep> However, when the government will not determine the wage and working conditions, but the wage and working conditions will be decided through negotiations with employers and through collective agreements, how can it be fair in the country? <sep><sep> In the era of dominant ideologies, globalization was called and it was a hegemony that was imposing its conditions everywhere. <sep><sep> It is no longer possible for people to continuously say that they are supposed to be "the majority of parents against". Because, currently, there is evidence that this is not true. <sep><sep> He is 32 years old, and he concerns all kinds of political sizes in Mauritius and in the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With everything in turmoil, many institutions in the Burzwa Government that are relatively more democratic, are being discredited: parliament, judiciary, unions - when the private sector, army, police are not doing well. <sep><sep> Not only have they not held replacement elections as quickly as possible, but PM Berenger even considered changing the law to postpone these elections even further. <sep><sep> Given that TUTF's money is only going to the federation, we find that there is a breakdown, fragmentation, and internal disarray within the trade union movement for this bureaucratic reason. <sep><sep> So, when Canal Dayot overflowed and two riverbanks overflowed onto Grand Rue, there were no passages through which this river could flow into the sea. <sep><sep> This "communal bifurcation" worsens the situation even more as this arrangement does not challenge the communal Best Loser system. <sep><sep> IWPS painted a mural on the wall facing the square that reads "Mari." <sep><sep> During the World Creole Language Day, and only when primary school children are taking the CPE exam on Saturday 26 October, LALIT gave a presentation on our education program in a press conference. <sep><sep> Arrange your own rules and ethics in your work, arrange your own end-of-year party. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Ramgoolam said the introduction of Creole will make Parliament more vibrant! <sep><sep> We were able to secure more contracts, such as Plastinax, Princes Tuna, Rosehill Transpor, Basalt, Cernol. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This year, communalism is on the rise, and Lalit has been using 2004 to prepare its anti-communal campaign. <sep><sep> Since that time, Lalit had condemned this perverse trafficking, which we said would inevitably provoke all kinds of dangerous communal dynamics. <sep><sep> So, every morning, I wake up at 5:00 am, 5:30, 6:00, and finally arrive at 8:00 when I come to consult, I have finished 3 meetings. <sep><sep> They are burying their heads in the sand to avoid facing reality, he said. <sep><sep> When a columnist dances, as the reports from the IPCC demonstrate, it becomes difficult to know which action is appropriate, and even when you know what is appropriate. <sep><sep> This separatist war in the Northern and Eastern regions of Sri Lanka has been going on for 37 years and has caused 70,000 deaths. <sep><sep> For example, today we are sitting and discussing politics, forming unions, and demonstrating. <sep><sep> We also found confusion, a somewhat ironic confusion, because it seems to be a nurtured confusion. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin said that there are no LALIT members who will agree on the same platform with Bizlall, and it is not a personal matter at all. <sep><sep> Look for the slogan "The currency must return to the Central Bank to reduce the depreciation of the Rupee". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and they are ordered because it suffers from pressure from common and obscure capitals. <sep><sep> He said, "It is inadmissible for a country like Mauritius in 2011 to import 5.2 billion of canned meat, canned fish, dairy, and related products [processed and preserved products]. <sep><sep> This has, in turn, created conflict between Finance Minister, Xavier Luc Duval and the Central Bank. <sep><sep> Beginning with Mauritian State, isolated Israeli State where diplomatic and sanction, especially an embargo against weapons, and so that all organizations and individuals considered boycotting work and finance from the State of Israel, and other countries below it like USA. <sep><sep> "In Lalit," Lindsey Collen said, "we maintained that the arrest of Cehl Meeah was done out of necessity to put him in prison when there was a visit from the American Secretary of State. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the limousine had disappeared from view in the distance. <sep><sep> Long ago they were saying they couldn't accept the slogan "adapt or perish" but rather "resist or perish". <sep><sep> "This Bill which aims to replace the Industrial Relations Act of 1973 has somehow integrated all the worst aspects of the Prof. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is very possible that a majority of people who are being counted in these 20,000, they were not chosen for it, part of them don't even know why they're included in it, and a good part knows where they are, which is not too clear what it is. <sep><sep> Many workers have not received any compensation because of the way in which this list has been established. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It mentioned "contempt of court" against the police who were arresting even more times after the court released them on bail, allegations of false alibis against lawyers accusing themselves. <sep> <sep> He said "like finding on a map, there is a lax irbin where there is a concentration of coal. <sep> <sep> LALIT takes pleasure in publishing a press release from a series of Creole language militants, publishers and writers. <sep> <sep> Despite all these sanctions, LALIT has reoriented its campaign, and we have done it well enough, and with good results. <sep> <sep> So, when these things start happening, like a car accident, when someone is injured or killed, there is a mini earthquake, we don't sweat about it, but it's a danger, this is called a social crisis. <sep> <sep> There are no more places where 3-4 teams in each village prepare a program for the village in our imagination. <sep> <sep> Large hotels in the Rivière Noire and Lesid regions have started renewing licenses for workers. <sep> <sep> Intrusion, invasion and occupation by imperial powers are mainly aimed at gaining control over the sources, production and distribution of fossil energy. <sep> <sep> All those present have agreed on a series of points, which a woman from South Africa put on paper. <sep> <sep> I know, for example, in South Africa, I have lived under apartheid. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Boolell Plan only aims to increase the production of lexis from time to time. <sep> <sep> We have decided what to put on each poster, and we have agreed to have the Lalit family prepare 50 posters with the slogan list that we have decided on together. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, as Mauritius celebrates Independence, the British Government is gathering people in the Indian Ocean to move forward with what is essentially equivalent to the privatization of the sea (which it calls the "Marine Protected Area") funded by the private sector. <sep> <sep> It also does union work, it has a uniform that identifies its member workers. <sep> <sep> In my opinion, the reindeer you have put in your corral, you can shoot it. <sep> <sep> According to this illegal person, negotiations for a second illegal bay are supposed to start in 2014. <sep> <sep> We participated in the documentation work, and we also attended the visit of Sam Wainwright. <sep> <sep> During this assembly, there was also a report from the Branches and Regional, plus reports from the three commissions of the Lalit. <sep> <sep> The analysis of Bidze-la by the report in terms of the solutions proposed, and also looking at how we need to rectify. <sep> <sep> Like Venezuela, it was only when Hugo Chavez came to power that he began to build a large demas party to defend his revolution. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A week after the Israeli military aggression in Gaza, LALIT together with Sant Idriss Goomany organized a solidarity vigil in Grand River South East in front of the LALIT office on the 20th of November, evening. <sep><sep> Last Sunday, the 9th of November, we gathered for a large Assembly in Mahebourg. <sep><sep> Before triggering a strike, you must notify the Minister, you must carry out a "secret ballot" meaning you must take a vote. <sep><sep> Website data shows that in 2008, there were 143,294 visits to our peace websites. <sep><sep> To say this, this means the conflict is serious. <sep><sep> Indeed, if we consider it, it has become so popularized that it is a well-known fact that the earth is in danger due to planetary warming and the hole in the ozone layer. <sep><sep> It is not known if female students have passed the Beit Iba checkpoint. <sep><sep> Today we are posing the question whether there are only about eleven people remaining in Lalit? <sep><sep> Even in the civil service, the lampwicks are rotting due to the politics of privatization. <sep><sep> The election results will bring an imbalance in the power relationship within the government between the MMM and the MSM. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In March this year, Ashok Subron, together with Devianand Narrain, manipulated the CAWU union to exclude other union members such as Rajni Lallah, Rada Kistnasamy, and myself (Ram Seegobin). <sep> <sep> Once again, Gaetan Duval, Deputy Prime Minister in 1983, played a key role in strengthening ties with America. <sep> <sep> Work has continued on its political strategy to make people believe in its process of "democratization of the economy". <sep> <sep> Navin Ramgoolam has intervened politically to obtain the "historic agreement". <sep> <sep> It is a tradition in LALIT to hold this kind of Residential Seminar: we looked at many books on economic crises, trade union movements, especially problems in the Middle East, and made action plans to guide our political work throughout the year. <sep> <sep> LALIT took note of the official publication released last week which showed that in the latest Census of 2011, there are 209,520 more people than expected speaking Creole at home compared to the 2000 census. <sep> <sep> Where a university student (FEEM) said that the University Student organization also has representation at the Communist Party of Cuba level. <sep> <sep> We cannot overlook these differences and claim that our "struggles" are the same. <sep> <sep> And when the guards catch them all, punishing them without repentance for good behavior (or even eternally!), then what kind of society will Mauritius be in? <sep> <sep> Prices will continue to rise as their policies depress the value of the rupee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have been accusing you of creating fake crises to worsen health problems and create more social issues. <sep> <sep> A single voice became three voices, four voices. <sep> <sep> Global unemployment rates are increasing with household debt, income disparities, and religious extremism. <sep> <sep> Along with the agro-industry, job loss is happening in the sugar, fishing, and textile sectors. <sep> <sep> Along with the classic theories from 70 to 150 years, many books analyze "the crisis" in economic theory. <sep> <sep> Deep River Beau Champ is expanding into Tanzania, FUEL Mozambique, Mon Loisir Kot Ivwar, Omnicane Kenya. <sep> <sep> The government has not shown much interest in promoting the Creole language further. <sep> <sep> The government must not give in to any pressure from the British or American governments to withdraw their resolution once it has been put in place. <sep> <sep> We were mobilizing against the loss of 50,000 jobs in the sugar and fishing industries, and we are working to create jobs in new sectors while the old ones are threatened. <sep> <sep> The rights of police officers to form a union were supported by LALIT. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT, since we came into existence, since we have been on the progressive trend of the MMM, we had a publication. <sep><sep> 11:15 Mama Mohammed called to say that tears are flowing in the olive grove in the western entrance of the village. <sep><sep> At some point it is inevitable that Pravind and his father will have to make a "deal" for the position of Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Mauritian Creole, as of today, is in the top 6% of languages in the world, with a significant number of people speaking it, with more than a million people speaking it. <sep><sep> To save their own posterior, they should have called on the State, when their own neo-liberal ideology dictates that the State should not interfere in the economy. <sep><sep> They are managing to mobilize certain unions in their pressure for the tourism industry. <sep><sep> After negotiations, the soldiers say they will let the marchers through if they present their passports. <sep><sep> Their Indian investor's profits, they take them out, not in Mauritius, so that they also avoid paying taxes in India. <sep><sep> And this kind of question makes religious belief a little ridiculous. <sep><sep> The DSD party and its allies knew that this policy would bring misery to the country but local companies preferred to become partners with multinational companies rather than resist them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to unite all sectors of the working class behind political demands that favor the entire working class, and oppose any efforts to create divisions within the working class. <sep> It doesn't seem like they are genuinely interested in addressing this problem philosophically. <sep> Then, 100 years later, after this era, where the financial capitalist process has dried up. <sep> Since the last general election, the Labour Party has been calling this "economic democratization", and they even have a special commission (Cader Syed Hossen, Nita Deerpalsing, etc.) to support this process. <sep> Bizlall is now present in the Platform against anti-worker laws and sometimes appears in other places where there are conflicts. <sep> And despite repressions in other countries around the world, new opposition parties have not been able to emerge. <sep> They also understood that love for contentment should never be taken for granted, that to make love, it must be earned, valued. <sep> Here, we will have a discourse and debate on the society that women are bringing and will bring. <sep> There are different social classes that exist in different ways. <sep> We have mentioned several of these manifestos in paragraph Number 2 above. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Finally, the interest of the ruling class is an interest that is closely tied with historical bourgeoisie, its class interest is a bourgeois class interest particularly opposite to the working class, especially facing the poor. <sep><sep> Socio-cultural organizations, communal socio-cultural organizations and obscurantist religious groups in Mauritius have increased their strength in confronting the oppressive regime and the parliamentary opposition. <sep><sep> As for the solution creation, in this budget there is nothing that addresses the real problems. <sep><sep> Active women in MARON have launched a women's movement called Femmes Solid'Air and were also interested in working in collaboration with women militants in MLF (Women's Liberation Movement). <sep><sep> And if there is a party that systematically conducts campaigning in favor of the mother tongue, it is LALIT. <sep><sep> It is worth noting that we briefly recount what happened in this Assembly. <sep><sep> Many children are ascending the stairs and beginning to chatter. <sep><sep> Meanwhile there is a struggle taking place in every country against national bourgeoisie, an international movement is needed to counter the state system which is there to protect, defend and consolidate the bourgeois kingdom. <sep><sep> The second challenge is how to counter the economic threats and, I will add, the ecological threats posed by Great Britain and America on the Chagos issue. <sep><sep> We found them on TV, in the mass protests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Last week 60 British MPs filed a complaint against the CIA at the International Court of Justice in America, to denounce the illegal torture of detainees on Diego Garcia. <sep> All this goes to show that it is the economy that is suffering from other crises, even though this truth is obscured by bourgeois ideologies that prefer to pretend than to reveal the economic system they promote. <sep> This means that we understand the political points of our program as a transitional program towards socialism, and not as a lie in a ration card. <sep> For example, "couillon" in France means pretty silly, while in Creole "kuyon" is used to mean anyone, someone, or even an animal, and it is not silly. <sep> Meanwhile, GWF is asking all workers and true militants to question their MPs on this issue. <sep> This means a social class, in a useful definition for understanding society. <sep> Lindsey Collen has emphasized that reading is often an apparently 'solitary' activity, just as an artist's work is. <sep> But Yahya Khan, the former President of Pakistan, disagreed that they should form a government. <sep> MMM is solely raising the issue of "corruption" for the Labour-MSM alliance, never any flaws. <sep> Just as you cannot blame an individual because he or she has to struggle to live because he or she does not have a job, but you have to blame a system that denies him or her a job, just like you. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The debate on Marxism has been ongoing since the beginning and until today.<sep><sep> The water department was closed for four hours, instead of three, because it takes at least an hour to close off. <sep><sep> The checkpoint and roadblocks are hindering the freedom movement in Palestine by the Israeli army. <sep><sep> In an interview, British Deputy John Marek, who was visiting Mauritius, said the USA should not impose any conditions on the transfer of sovereignty over Chagos to Mauritius. <sep><sep> Chemin Grenier is as beautiful as in Mahebourg, Rose Belle, and Riviere des Anguilles as well. <sep><sep> There was the first Stalinist challenge, where, in the USSR after the Russian Revolution, and which attracted a series of satellites after the USSR inflicted defeat on capitalist fascism in Germany. <sep><sep> So his first work was deciding to create a "Treasury of Pan African Stories". <sep><sep> It represents a capital shift from historical bourgeoisie to this emerging new bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The Road Map mentions that out of the nearly 23.5 billion over the next 10 years to restrict the security industry, almost half will come out of national taxes. <sep><sep> there were parts that could have done this work, despite the fact that workers were scattered throughout Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Pravind Jugnauth's name will go down in history as someone who started the idea of ​​a "Welfare State" gradually. <sep><sep> 100 to 200 Chagossian families and families in Lalit and MLF. <sep><sep> * Regularize seasonal work with a Job Contractor in the Security Industry, as it was 40 years ago. <sep><sep> What they call leropeg, it is not really the same here, they are powerful countries, which act like imperial powers, like France and Germany, and then there are countries stronger than Lagres, Portugal. <sep><sep> Any Alliance will spend more than 100 million rupees to deceive and influence voters. <sep><sep> When people mobilize, society is already changing - even before mobilization has its impact. <sep><sep> 7 He has developed corruption on a commercial basis. <sep><sep> It is these economic and political objectives that are causing this instability (Re-Make, then Koz-Koze, then Re-Make again, political scandals from Gooljaury to Frer Timol, CT Power, etc.) which is creating a series of political crises in Mauritius in February 2013. <sep><sep> The reality is that it is your rights that you have, really depending, at a given moment, as a group/class, on the amount of social and political power you have. <sep><sep> It is essential to understand the political course, and the history of your political party. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> An agronomist from AREU, Dr. Yusouf Ismael, also spoke. <sep> He was very concerned about wasting time on the past. <sep> There was an EIA, Environmental Impact Assessment, and its report found it risky to have a power station there. <sep> Their proposal for a new Supreme Court building fell through. <sep> Maybe we need to remember that Aneerood Jugnauth developed a privileged relationship with China, Singapore, and wealthy Sino-Mauritians. <sep> Personally, I think we shouldn't, because the government hasn't officially said there is a "war room", we shouldn't, because the government hasn't officially said there is a "Delivery Unit" which is like the government is sitting on a back of toilet seat. <sep> All of this is being absorbed by thousands of young people who potentially could have counted as proud citizens. <sep> The consciousness of the ruling class makes a worker conscious that he is exploited like a class. <sep> All the individuals who have been mimicking school know that the school of life is harsh. <sep> Even Aneerood Jugnauth, a distinguished gentleman, admitted to not reading any book, he announced he took the Fukuyama book with him when he was going on holidays to Rodrigues. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Friend Zorz: Earlier a friend spoke about China and Russia, and we know what system was in place and what is happening there now. <sep><sep> That's how Mauritius can tackle the challenges the security industry is facing with increasingly stringent safety protocols and at the same time move forward in food production that is "non-GMO" (GMO-FREE) guaranteed. <sep><sep> In practice, their democracy and freedom are severely controlled, just for the simple reason that they are not in their society and they have no political rights in Mauritius (not even the right to vote here while they work in Mauritius). <sep><sep> After their second meeting, they decided to meet more often. <sep><sep> Finally, there is the case of Asha Rampadaruth where Bizlall has gone into a hunger strike with this former employee of SBM garnering an increase in his severance pay from Rs1 million to Rs2.4 million. <sep><sep> But the infrastructure of the old system is still there - like buildings, monuments, squares; <sep><sep> We look at what is the fundamental principle in this case? <sep><sep> Yes, Life has blessed me with your love; I am thankful for the affection you all have given me. <sep><sep> We have found 19 times Grand River, plus 2-3 times members' homes. <sep><sep> We are going to start by looking at categories of workers with less democracy and freedom and delve into the spectrum towards categories of workers with more. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Children aged 5 to 16 are in good health. <sep><sep> The eleventh person may not make me believe that the first year of a 15% increase will merit a 12% increase in bus ticket prices. <sep><sep> Despite their differences, the Timi-Balram family was united by love between parents, love for children, children for parents, and love among children. <sep><sep> Who was living in that beautiful house? Good spirits or malice? Perhaps they needed to pay a visit. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth and Ashok Jugnauth, at the same time, before they held their rally on May 1st. <sep><sep> First, there's AGOA, where an exception is made for Mauritian entrepreneurs to sell their clothing, specifically American t-shirts. <sep><sep> It also involves speaking out against the repression of a section of small entrepreneurs/contractors, plantation owners, NGO leaders, and even a section of the labor movement. <sep><sep> For example, Collendavelloo suggests that there should be no candidate other than the Leader on the proportional list. <sep><sep> Nowadays, we no longer need to walk with the idea that the police are behind us, even when we make a strong push. <sep><sep> This shows how the idea of workers on strike has emerged, and continues to grow, the class struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Below, the real basis for the lamas system makes it different for everyone. <sep><sep> "Economic cuts need to be made in the family budget, which is in crisis because work has become scarce, prices have risen, homes have become more expensive, and the cost of living has increased" – all of this is true. So, there is that significance. <sep><sep> It's not about people tightening their belts or pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, no. <sep><sep> The conclusion is that if the path that was traced at that time had continued, there wouldn't have been the catastrophic situation the country would have gone through. <sep><sep> After this visit, a period of reflection on these various conclusions could lead to a new understanding and establish a regional foundation. <sep><sep> Now, the Workers' Government is looking into making mandatory overtime in other sectors of work: ERB Bunwaree proposes mandatory overtime of 20 hours per citizen. <sep><sep> Meaning militant work, political work, educational work, in time. <sep><sep> If you want a subscription, contact us at lalitmail@intnet.mu <sep><sep> America utilized Mauritian territory to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq in barbaric attacks. <sep><sep> In the face of this economic crisis that is also leading to an increase in social problems, the PT-PMXD government is coming up with a strong slogan of 'Economic Democratization'. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The political situation is ripe for the mobilization Lalit is proposing. <sep> <sep> Lalit takes pleasure in publishing here a relevant transcript of the speech that Pascal Nadal delivered when the Playgroup Federation launched their 6 riders, in the Mama Bul Later hall, LPT, Grand River South East, Saturday 9th December. <sep> <sep> Comrade Lindsey was describing the militant socialist work in the trade unions, like Sadna in Nursing, and others in GTU were doing. <sep> <sep> In the final part of the conference press, Rajni Lallah explained the celebration Lalit is organizing for the Workers' Day in Grand River South East. <sep> <sep> In 2005, we proceeded to a draw to determine which community each Lalit candidate will be placed on their Nomination Paper. <sep> <sep> Before we take the dime, on Monday, we go through Rafah, it's a balancing act. <sep> <sep> So, early morning, we go to Britannia, we enter the small rooms, in search. <sep> <sep> This Workshop has found the need to establish a network that will facilitate communication between the different works being done in this region of Africa. <sep> <sep> The Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Management of MBC, both, showed interest in the course, but could not attend. <sep> <sep> The global capitalist system is unable to ensure a minimum of legal rights, the right to food, and even the right to work for everyone on this planet. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, on the Ferme militaire, the artisans in UASI went to protest in 1978, they went to protest on Pon Solitid, against the military base. <sep><sep> The same as he is going through to favor the Gamma Civic Ah Teck, Infinity Jean Suzanne, Ralph Loren, Rakesh Gooljaury. <sep><sep> Never, in the past MMM, there were only 11 deputies in Parliament. <sep><sep> For those who were most important, it was their security and comfort that mattered to them. <sep><sep> This is important because it causes instability in Mauritius, it causes suffering to the Chagossians, and it even has significance in all this conflict. <sep><sep> Today what remains to be done is to institutionalize opposition against police violence. <sep><sep> Its budget deficit surpasses one trillion Dollar per year, and has reached $14.3 trillion. <sep><sep> I have also shown that there are too many musicians in our country. This is why some have always said that they trust our institutions but not all those who are part of our institutions. <sep><sep> They regroup based on different criteria and interests - on human rights, different sports, music, leisure, gender, economic interests, culture or religion. <sep><sep> Some people have been saying for a long time that if nothing is done to prevent fires from spreading, one day the country will turn into ashes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, according to this, the Alliance and the MMM they don't deserve anyone's trust. <sep> <sep> We're starting to see a 'class politics' emerge, in relation to 'electoral politics'. <sep> <sep> At the same time, there was a period of 2 months, where Navin Ramgoolam, the Prime Minister of Mauritius, was not in the country. <sep> <sep> But at the same time, for the kids who are going to those 9-10 "Star Colleges", they don't want to say where those kids are coming from. <sep> <sep> We're publishing copies of the petition that the students of the Stand Alone Module "Introduction to Creole Studies (CREO 1001)" wrote to the University of Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Within 3,000 families have chosen the Creole language last year and another 3,000 families this year. <sep> <sep> And what the Government is doing here, it seems like what the governments of other countries are doing. <sep> <sep> Basically, the press is one of those institutions that have in place all the conditions that allow the implementation of all kinds of private contracts that have public funding. <sep> <sep> Strategy, for a political party like LALIT, it doesn't look like the strategies of other political parties. <sep> <sep> A small part by Neville Alexander on the African Language Academy (ACALAN); a small part by Shamil Jeppy on the "Tradition of Literacy in Africa" where he made reference to the manuscripts of Timbuktu. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Who went to Westbank with a family organization, which witnesses and exposes the repression on the Israeli checkpoints. <sep><sep> This financial crisis in the USA and especially in Europe, has a direct impact on the economy of Mauritius. Many hotels are suffering. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we must fight based on a program, based on an ideology that puts the interests of the working class first. <sep><sep> It prevents us from living the true Mauritian culture, the true Mauritian mentality. <sep><sep> This strong consciousness often protects establishments, even if not always. <sep><sep> Then when that feud is over, we will get the real Sathan priest. <sep><sep> On November 14, in Algiers, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Resolution 1514 which was voted in the United Nations condemning all colonialism all over the world. <sep><sep> Ecuador is a place where there was a US military base, in a seaport called Manta. <sep><sep> We use my "work" to mean "produce work". <sep><sep> Same night, the police arrested leaders of subversive movements. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>What did you say we need to do? - Kill all children between seven and twelve, Votmazeste. <sep><sep>We can say that in general terms, MMM and MSM have a fairly similar economic strategy to the Workers. <sep><sep>Excuse me i am telling you, you have gained independence! <sep><sep>It is through a political organization that all this political experience, that political memory is codified in a political program. <sep><sep>This work to build a such a movement, LALIT has begun it. <sep><sep>Because there are certain moments where the seriousness of a situation calls us. <sep><sep>Ram Seegobin who was presiding over welcomed all members la assembly. <sep><sep>Plus, the capitalist class managed to recover because it had created a bourgeois state (the bourgeoisie either destroyed or softened until it became a bad Lerwa-Larenn State, which existed before). <sep><sep>It is consolidating its position, establishing its authority over the MPA with the complicity of several eco organizations. <sep><sep>so subsidies on diesel production have become illegal, which subsidies make for treason, which subsidies make production for ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In this way, America believes it can use "soft power" to mask its true face as a powerful country that is militarily controlling Mauritius.<sep><sep> The National Unity Government had its own God to protect it.<sep><sep> 40,000 employees each (the vast majority of them being small employees such as shopkeepers, mechanics, shop owners, hairdressers, truck drivers, small-scale entrepreneurs, small growers).<sep><sep> If you don't have a certificate of good conduct, you won't get a job.<sep><sep> so many working classes are taking part (for various reasons, quite objective, and also subjective reasons, unfortunately) that the capitalist government is taking advantage of the lapses.<sep><sep> These 5 jobs are, first of all, a gathering of stories (traditional and modern) on a pan-African basis with the idea that it can also be transmitted in many African languages available. <sep><sep> are we responding as political militants, are we adapting, are we understanding the mutations.<sep><sep> As individuals, we are exposed to dominant ideologies, and today the dominant ideology is the bourgeois ideology.<sep><sep> But, when he eventually reached the end, when he found himself imbued with the MCIT, everything unfolded differently, from the way he carried out the whole history of Mauritius up to that moment. <sep><sep> Destroying the homeland: In the security industry through VRS/in textiles by encouraging delocalization/in civil services because of privatization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He criticized what he called "a unilateral move by M. Abbas to demand recognition of Palestine." <sep><sep> The demand we have made - LALIT and MLF - is for victims of violence to go directly to the hospital, and for a family member to come forward to be interviewed. <sep><sep> And this is where Marx comes into play uniquely. <sep><sep> As you have heard, I don't speak like a Seychellois or a Mauritian; I speak differently. <sep><sep> So, we are holding this press conference with that aim. <sep><sep> This seminar was important, because many people are completely confused about what the strategy was, and what the tactics were, and what maneuvering behavior was. <sep><sep> The enemy in this battle knows that you are joking. <sep><sep> The two children were left with all the olives that fell to the ground. <sep><sep> There is a simple answer, and there is a very complicated answer to this question. <sep><sep> We also have a Trade Union Commission, which is currently reflecting on our relationship with the trade union movement, on how the trade union movement should react in the face of crisis, in the face of the current situation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a conflict because Laliyn, whom Mr. Roy defended, was not even the Laliyn we were defending. <sep> We appreciate that Minister Cuttaree, finally, made an official declaration in WTO saying that "social services" need to fall outside the WTO's "scope." <sep> Her daughter took a photo of her mother in every possible way. <sep> When the systemic crisis is at its peak, when 42% of workers are having trouble with an SME, when many people are striking. <sep> In truth, at the political level, there is no difference between a “serf” who lies on the land of a boss who was a dictator, and a slave; there is no economic difference. <sep> This problem becomes more complex when in the same school, in addition to teachers using a foreign instructional language, there are no appropriate pedagogues or adequate educational materials. <sep> For example, their main issue, as Yannick says, is to launch a campaign to release 5 Kibin political prisoners in the US. <sep> After a lot of debate and phone calls, they decided that Hazi would go to Ramallah to see Hebron. <sep> All those men who were used to boasting once, one time, changed their ways without them noticing. <sep> One of those Plans is certainly useless and does nothing for the security industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Friday 1st May, a Public Conference, a Day for the Abolition of Slavery. <sep> <sep> During a press conference, that is to say in public, we did it. <sep> <sep> He is proposing to bring a second series of legal battles in the British courts to challenge the Order in Council 1965 that Moris demanded. <sep> <sep> Now he is saying that Siddar Bidze is ultra-liberal, I suppose he means "ultra-ultra-liberal". <sep> <sep> Then, even so, where will you go to find what we call the Supreme Court. <sep> <sep> There is this kind of civil society that can represent more of a handicap in this fight for socialism, in this fight to strengthen the working class. <sep> <sep> We have a union strategy called “Interunion Work Labaz”. <sep><sep> 1400 Palestinians, a civil majority, have lost their lives in this military aggression. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, we can act like workers, until we understand the situation. <sep><sep> Among these, they asked not to fall into communal campaigns and Best Loser resets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is not a stick to beat a lot and a cigarette smoker who is winning the environment. <sep> University of Mauritius should orient its research towards agricultural production based on the development of traditional knowledge and not on its replacement. <sep> In our country, there are so many people who know how to work the land. <sep> There was a question and debate for another long time. <sep> Shamil Jeppy said that Algebra and Literacy in Arabic script were initiated in Timbuktu, in Africa. <sep> Diego Garcia - a military base on "Diego Garcia" is not even mentioned in the Manifesto. <sep> There is opposition from the union (weakened by 2 new laws EREA and ERIA), from the press (100% pro-capitalist), and from the "civil society" (where everyone is deploring the situation in Mauritius). <sep> Not only this, but the Resistance has stated that they are not challenging the Bestloser system. <sep> Ram Seegobin had several radio programs where, for example, he challenged Garrioch on the economy. <sep> We heard Minister Soodhun on the radio speaking in an unacceptable manner: inciting xenophobic feelings against foreign workers and in a statement on the radio, urging the police to beat people; he said the police are not here to "caress" people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the last 10 years, his income has decreased by 8-10 times, from 40,000 to 5,000. <sep> So, according to ERA, peace and job conditions, for this, whether union and workers, go check this out with the direct boss. <sep> Indirect oppression involves an 'organization' of ideas and knowledge that work in a specific direction together with material support that is not directly visible. <sep> There are 2 Protocols attached to the Pelindaba Treaty which urge countries like the USA to sign, but it doesn't entirely take into consideration nuclear activities on Diego Garcia. <sep> I know the usual practice of describing myself as a leader. <sep> It was not a secret for anyone that the important decisions were being taken, not in the cabin but in the elite committee that runs the central committee of GSEK. <sep> Never before has a Prime Minister been able to act in such a way. <sep> We disagree with the system where a male-dominated society and majority of men also dominate. <sep> They say we should go and take a microcredit to start a small business. <sep> In the beginning, we are, when Revi and other publications are in Creole, where everyone can contribute their article. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Um S. and Lulu made their way until they reached the edge of the water. <sep><sep> Through institutions and also through forces that believed themselves to be just and an alliance that was not clear, all of that led to the decline of the MMM. <sep><sep> The colony outpost is on the hill opposite the colony of Eli which is located on the neighboring hill. <sep><sep> Without changing the economy and the mode of production, but only by reaching a revolution, we also brought about a class struggle. <sep><sep> During the Ut' 79 strike, there were two great, powerful forces, pitted against each other: the working class against the capitalist class. <sep><sep> Paule Ninan's family will greatly miss her: her sister, Hilda, her nephew, Jean-Jean, and her niece, Brigitte, as well as all of her adopted family members who will miss her dearly in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Construction workers on a construction site, if a worker is absent on a Monday, the boss deducts a bonus for 100% attendance for a month. <sep><sep> Up to 2013, to this day, almost the same number of children have already opted to speak the Creole language. <sep><sep> The union has also criticized the police and the Park authorities for their erroneous role during investigations where police officers were potentially accused. <sep><sep> The Kibin Family Federation has 4 million members and they have a system where they contribute 4 rupees per month. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There should be a sufficient social security allowance for people to live on if they are unemployed. <sep><sep> Industrial 1780 The capitalist system emerges for the first time, Lerop. <sep><sep> The era of a downturn When we see what LALIT and its members and its strictness have done over the years, sometimes it may seem that we have done a lot, sometimes not enough. <sep><sep> But if cutting 10 feet, or cutting a number of feet, expert experience says, agricultural superficies lighting, it is released for direct entry. <sep><sep> - The second largest mother tongue among numbers, namely Bhojpuri Morisyen, is, also, possibly introduced (namely, it is an achievement for the mother tongue). <sep><sep> We are already aware that coming down the street is not enough to change our lives. <sep><sep> On the other hand, there is a collective listerine phenomenon that can make a group of people (especially children) react psychologically when there is a physical problem affecting a few people in that group. <sep><sep> On Sundays 1st Ziyet and Saturdays 14th Ziyet we will be having our Seminar, he said. <sep><sep> Isn't it time to develop insurance on other agricultural products besides sugar cane? <sep><sep> So the money that was being received was just enough to cover up the facts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But what the Revival of the Class manifesto has, is not on any online platform. <sep><sep> Then, Bizlall started a collective farm. He, a man, called a mass meeting. <sep><sep> Even though some villages, opposition has emerged quite strong, Riviere du Rempart, Mahebourg. The PT-PMSD government kept control. <sep><sep> The first sign of this new interest, is for the first time an American president visited their military base at Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> His handicapped child - he was a trisomic - had lived a long time, longer than usual, because, Timi thought, everyone spoiled him too much. <sep><sep> He doesn't even need to say all that, as if he says that it's not good with what's going on nowadays. <sep><sep> The second phase is Hurnam, it's a crusade that he's bringing against certain people in the judiciary, and against certain lawyers. <sep><sep> On the other hand, they are doing everything to mask the embarrassment through rigid office stamp stationary, pulling people into training after training, paying for placement of youngsters in different companies. <sep><sep> 6 He used favoritism in the Civil Service and student scholarships. <sep><sep> (Not just that zone of fish processing called the "Seafood Hub") <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He marked the time when the man deprived his heritage his stake dilu, even his "social status" to his son. <sep><sep> There are various political parties in Mauritius, and some very specific ones like LALIT, such as its internal democracy, its documentation allowing its internal democracy not just a formality, and the fact that its strict rules were the strictest MMM, were its best. <sep><sep> The Shin Bet police arrested him, saying they arrested him because they suspected him of being involved in a case of sending pink envelopes to Israeli settlers in the West Bank. <sep><sep> According to them, the two Diesel engines would be better if eaten together. <sep><sep> LALIT also has a program to replace the Best Loser Clutch, which carries democracy in Mauritius, with a proportional dose. <sep><sep> For Dharam Raj and the leaders of the Grand Society Endo-Kreol (GSEK), each movement of Fanfan Tabardenn gave them a pretext to consolidate their racist power. <sep><sep> Comrade Ahmed Khan explained that in Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are many degenerate organizations with degenerate cultures, traditions and political experiences that are still very active. <sep><sep> Recent events, one after another, have exposed the way in which a bourgeoisie government emerges in a post-colonial economy as has happened in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Furthermore, a series of family companies in Port Louis have been importing large quantities of merchandise such as textiles, grain sacks, and agricultural tools for the past 50 to 200 years. <sep><sep> Is it a political struggle to mean that there is a power struggle whose goal is to persuade the State's power? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the National Liberation Front meeting, the USA was planning to organize political movements in the city to support pro-USA movements, to deceive people into thinking they needed to fear bombardments. <sep> The largest union, SILU, and its sister organization, PLHDWU, suffered losses. <sep> This means that work becomes less regulated and the employer can organize their workforce in a way that minimizes what they have to pay the workers. <sep> Meanwhile, there have been frequent confrontations between many trade unions and the PT establishment - which has been carrying out a series of attacks against the union movement through the new EReA and EriA. <sep> Timi managed to form a monitoring group where each member set up their own literacy school, sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the evening depending on whether people were free or not. <sep> However, they managed to form their seven Regional councils, with each Regional council having 200-300 affiliated organizations. <sep> Thank you Sourya! - Listen, stop talking nonsense! It's just a drop of dew on a leaf. <sep> I heard that they are making a special offer on artificial turf and olive apricot jam. <sep> And if they make a mistake again, we will mobilize to stop them. <sep> "I found their way of proceeding during their Congress quite traditional," Cindy Clelie said. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that every time, where possible, we seek to create a link, so that we can learn from the different organizations that work, and at the same time, it is a place where we can mobilize entire political programs that we defend. <sep><sep> Because of the same election, we unite the community through the ballot box. <sep><sep> Then, when we find these 40 people together, around one table, it consequently creates a new common ground in favor of the Creole language. <sep><sep> English and French should be taught without neglecting the mother tongue. <sep><sep> The US military occupation in Iraq signifies an invasion where other countries have a target to gain more control over natural resources, especially oil. <sep><sep> The MMM has succeeded in doing this with the support of a labor movement section (especially the unionist Bizlall), and with media coverage. <sep><sep> Film: Peadar King TV Ireland, The Chagos Islands are Closed (25 Mins). <sep><sep> And tonight, the President has no constitutional way to find out who will be appointed as a majority, so he calls himself the Prime Minister. <sep><sep> Ahmed Khan has analyzed the political history of Pakistan and Afghanistan in detail in this session, which has enabled us to better understand the way things have evolved politically in Pakistan and Afghanistan today. <sep><sep> On 11 December, residents of the entire village in Mauritius will go to vote to elect 124 village councils to represent them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people do not have time, running behind their tails, when they finally get to eat, they have to go look for another tail to fill their stomach. <sep> <sep> In his analysis, he said, there were two ways to reproduce himself in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> And, because of his dependence on Travayis, in his declarations during which new deputy Pravind Jugnauth stated that he will be loyal and concentrated his attacks against Berenger, especially, and Sithanen sometimes, at the same time he threatened Ramgoolam with hope to receive an invitation for an alliance. <sep> <sep> There are sectors like the SME sector which today employ more than 40% of people in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> Just before that Condoleezza Rice greeted Dalai Lama for his courage. <sep> <sep> we have taken a row of each candidate (from his 3 lists in the same block) and the first letter of their last name. <sep> <sep> to find out where we are today, what different interests are conflicting in this battle, where we all come from, where the situation seems to be heading. <sep> <sep> So they do a job as a kind of observatory, a permanent investigation to ensure that the decisions and policies adopted are implemented, and at the same time they also act as a link between the labaz and deciding authorities. <sep> <sep> There was a debate on what's happening concerning religion. <sep> <sep> We also had everyone do and present a "review" of a series of different articles in Health Documentation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, this is a constant reminder of the LALIT that has emerged. <sep><sep> It's a good reminder of how the Mauritian Lawyers Association with G. Duval, Guy Ollivry, Rama Valayden, and Mario Helene, who took birth to defend the rights of the Ahnee. <sep><sep> Workers' hard work is becoming exactly like a stepping stone. <sep><sep> Even if it seemed like we were receiving a certain protection from the consequences of development in the global economy, I believe it is now becoming more and more evident, even blatant, that the economy of Mauritius, Mauritian society in general, is going through turmoil. <sep><sep> An employer can tell you "I am a 'people' like you, me". <sep><sep> So, since the beginning of this financial crisis, as comrade Lindsey Collen has already predicted it could turn into a full-blown crisis, maybe it will become a dollar crisis. <sep><sep> Professors and students who need to pass checkpoints every morning and afternoon to get to school are a form of resilience. <sep><sep> Then, to prevent bankruptcy of these big insurance and finance companies, when many individuals and small companies have already gone bankrupt. <sep><sep> The Ashok Jugnauth and Eric Guimbeau duo, who allied with the MMM in the 2010 elections, have distanced themselves from this remake process. <sep><sep> And not only that, negotiations have taken place between the Minister of Labour, the CNT employers and the CNT union. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we get the UN 79 as a major event in a decisive situation that is unfolding, everything is unfolding. <sep><sep> This is surprising to us, that all sorts of things are being discussed in reality, at a time when we are holding our Conference. <sep><sep> Paul Berenger, he believes he may have raised the issue of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos Islands since the American military base issue on the Chagos Islands. <sep><sep> We must have a permanent link, or unconditional, with the various bureaucratic trade unions, which tend to develop in all federations. <sep><sep> It is an "assessment" of our political work for 5 years. <sep><sep> Today if Madagascar can export its textiles to SADC, it is because we are sheltered from all imperialist maneuvers. <sep><sep> What is needed, what is essential, in fact, he said, is that the mother tongue must be used as a medium in schools. <sep><sep> This is a negotiation between trade union and employer representatives in the presence of the Labor Minister. <sep><sep> This is related to our political work against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. <sep><sep> LALIT members, who went to Lesbia for the Gaza Freedom March, participated in several demonstrations there in 2010. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to set up a new cyber-tower where we don't have to rely on good agricultural land. <sep> Indeed, it will help food security, with no obstacles. <sep> However, pressure is mounting quickly, there is no way out, Creole and Bhojpuri are starting to become formal languages. <sep> a fight to preserve the rights of individuals against globalization which is benefiting multinational corporations and financial speculators. <sep> When schools do not provide this framework, it hinders such development. <sep> They have finally been born from a workers movement in a period where society, in a capitalist economy, was in crisis. <sep> Only after the implementation of these 3 preconditions will workers be able to ensure that any future sanctions in the IRA will favor workers and not employers. <sep> The Bush administration does not know what they know, it is all an unconscious ideological complexity of beliefs and practices that state that the United States is the most advanced civilization in the world, giving it the right to play the role of the police. <sep> They chose to live in the crossroads where several currents pass, and they had the will to navigate despite the difficulties. <sep> But it is a corpse with 32 injuries that came out of Alcatraz. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He explains how difficult it has become to navigate - taking 4 hours to pass through the checkpoints. <sep><sep> The influence you suffer as an individual, they have a lot of power. <sep><sep> According to our analysis, what many people today accept, the Labour Party has long represented a formation of a detailed bourgeoisie, and politically it does so through the creation of a historical block around this process. <sep><sep> The conflict between capitalist economy and ecology, and the working class cannot find harmony, at the moment (though it is in their long-term interest) in a position where it can reconcile itself with a fully ecological environment. <sep><sep> We have continued to maintain vigilance to ensure that the colonizers do not go to attack the 3 other planters who have managed to enter their ranks. <sep><sep> No increase in taxes on the poor or on companies. <sep><sep> There are deputies who have saved lawsuits that have found the workers of Zon Frans. <sep><sep> Through a coherent program, and a clear program, where the working class, the only class that has a stake and the strength to challenge capital, to challenge the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Even when Gilbert Ahnee saw the election results, he always claims that Cader Sayed-Hossen's score has nothing to do with his campaign and that Raj Dayal's supporters prefer to think that there is no claim at all. <sep><sep> But the truth is, they do not acknowledge democratic rights, civil and political rights: that is, public rights to have information to be able to have a say in the kind of society we want. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian newspaper Le Mauricien and Week-End had more coverage. <sep><sep> It is evident that this type of coverage can only be countered by mobilization in Mauritius against these diseases. <sep><sep> What we need to do is find policies that support this economic sector. <sep><sep> Renewable energy production is creating jobs, and it is in harmony with a more sustainable development of the tourism industry, as its pollution is much less. <sep><sep> * Existing social rights, such as education, health, elderly pensions, housing, disability - rights that are doubly important for families - are threatened by the neo-liberal policies that the last government implemented and the current government is implementing. <sep><sep> Since 25, more inhabitants have been coming than before, even though the total population has remained stable. <sep><sep> If the world's population was growing stronger, life in Mauritius was like a shattered memory everywhere, fragmented, broken up everywhere, seeming like bits of clouds separated in the sky. <sep><sep> Here, with so much overwhelming force, the Moroccan Dirham and the Bahraini Dinar, they both, have announced that they are introducing a parliamentary system. <sep><sep> We found that the US and European governments are coming to prevent big financial corporations from going bankrupt. <sep><sep> Coins from Pobjoy Mint have a royal wedding coin, on one side with the inscription “PRINCE WILLIAM AND CATHERINE MIDDLETON WEDDING 29 APRIL 2011”, and Queen Elizabeth on the other side. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In capitalist classrooms trying to erase these rights. <sep><sep> The lack of integrity in the Blok 104 operations is being exposed. <sep><sep> We go and talk with a group of residents whose salaries have been suspended. <sep><sep> He deplores the submission of the bulk regime in Mwayenn Oryan. <sep><sep> This term, which Antonio Gramsci invented 100 years ago, is called "bloc" in English, it is also called "block". <sep><sep> A4 on the 4th day, played in 3 concerts: a concert full of people in front of 2,000 people in an amphitheater called Theatre du Verdure in Tana-nariv; <sep><sep> So, when senior officials say they can investigate, it's just rhetoric. <sep><sep> For this to become a reality, we must change the power relationship in favor of workers and the masses oppressed by the current economic and political system. <sep><sep> We have risen and are waiting for the heart since A. <sep><sep> We have said that if the night does not correct itself today and tonight, we will come to eat in the evening and then not in the night in Marda. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the same time, when PT and PMSD began to decline, MMP took over its formation, thus becoming part of the political landscape in the '70s to '90s with a class divide, a pro-worker class divide. <sep><sep> And this authoritarianism is the last resort, has really tight spaces. <sep><sep> It has created a class with a mentality of its own. <sep><sep> So, they face a real problem. Otherwise, I would have delved into more details. <sep><sep> This bourgeois ideology spreads from within the family where we are supposed to follow the "chief of the clan" and listen to what he says, even in schools, where children learn to "listen" when the authorities give them orders. <sep><sep> Shouldn't we give more rights and strength to women and children with disabilities? <sep><sep> This is how and when the bourgeois ideology clashes with political power. <sep><sep> Just after 5 YEARS, following the LORD's decision to take control of the government, they decided to take over control of transport, imports, all markets. <sep><sep> Then, actions in the Stock Exchange (Labours) in the Americas, Great Britain, Europe, and other parts have lost half their "selling price". <sep><sep> If we succeed in going against the British and American Governments, we will take full advantage of it to negotiate separately with the Chagossians. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We change the land, but in a way that is part of an ecological system. <sep><sep> When Nann and Fatma take over, they give their all. <sep><sep> For now, they will tell you, until new elections are held, in 2 - 3 years, under UN supervision, there may be new elections but meanwhile, all those civic, democratic, political rights, expanded meaning they have been consolidated, go hand in hand with the law. <sep><sep> It's not something on which we think there should be repression against women, on sexuality and reproduction. <sep><sep> In 2000, the number of press permits decreased to 65,000. <sep><sep> - Will the same victory come in CWA, CEB, CNT? <sep><sep> And the First Eye Movement, also known as PMT before, we worked together. <sep><sep> He's an “anti-communalist.” He proclaims a “New Constitution” that they have prepared for him. <sep><sep> Because goods are not selling, one business after another is starting to close, even going bankrupt. <sep><sep> Sir Ralph was impressed by the personality of Ganga, who was like a star shining from afar in a sky of tar hardened by menacing twisting and destruction. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bizlall has continued to work to promote a trade union called para-state in harmony with what he calls 'free sector'. <sep><sep> Not only for a certain period of time, but also altogether. <sep><sep> I learned to work quickly and quickly I started organizing my pets to do the tasks quickly. <sep><sep> They told him in an article in the newspaper. <sep><sep> This is essential for all children, to develop their ability to think and acquire knowledge at a higher level in science, mathematics and other languages. <sep><sep> It continues the trend of threats to privatize the CWA. <sep><sep> So, after recounting these 5 major current events in which Lalit played a significant role in Mauritius. <sep><sep> He was also on the radio during the election of Mrs. Sonia Gandhi in India. <sep><sep> The third thing is the role of a political organization and we are looking at it in the program, it is the quality of service that LALIT militants give in workers' class organizations. <sep><sep> After independence, the Working Government introduced the para-state part. and we have a new federation, the Federation of Federally Constituted Syndicates. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And among the tears that fill his eyes, it is the one with the most survival sense that has the most depth." In this linear reflection, there are also many irrational concepts. <sep><sep> It is their convoluted strategy to build a new "Historical Block" where each component gets a small share, and where the bourgeoisie continues its reign without trouble. <sep><sep> I was going to ask you to help me (I am helping myself here) especially because when we are about to connect our interpretation system directly with our invented system, there can be interference. <sep><sep> Perhaps we will leave room for the Balancy to be able to stand if you leave the party after saying that you won't accept being the Best Loser. <sep><sep> * The State allows the economically strongest class to become the most powerful politically. <sep><sep> * Gradually replace all minimum wages and work conditions in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, often imposed by employers. <sep><sep> - An analysis of where we are today, with class discrimination in society, namely an analysis of class, an analysis of patriarchy, an analysis of imperialism, an analysis of the nature of 21st-century capitalism, an analysis of different sectors of capital, and an analysis of the nature of this capitalist State; <sep><sep> Then, when this is blocked by Environmentalists or by movements in Albion, you will have a great socio-cultural movement that is debating in favor of CT Power. <sep><sep> At noon, after that, Ragini met a group of activists in Okinawa and during a 3-hour meeting, they discussed the struggle against the bases, her links with other struggles. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we continue to find the recurring problem of a colonial mind among Mauritian intellectuals. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even though 2/3 of the population were present, they lost family, including grandparents. <sep><sep> When MMM-PSM come to power, we see the direction MMM quickly traitor and sell land for the re-fortification of Mauritian territories and strengthening the American base on Diego. <sep><sep> Because of McDonald's, a multinational fast food was being introduced to Mauritius. <sep><sep> Syndicate, Language and Education, International, Diego, Environment and Ecology, Web, Documentation Commission. <sep><sep> This bourgeois section that we are in LALIT, we call it the bourgeois detail; businessmen who hold capital and workers help to enter the bourgeoisie through discretionary service. <sep><sep> They thought it was not enough, so they decided to practice family planning which just entered the country. <sep><sep> After the Conference "Free Diego, free Chagos" we had in 2010, for the first time since independence, the government announced that it was taking a case to an International Tribunal. <sep><sep> It is a phenomenon that, in a way, is a little blind; it does not know where it's going, but at least over there, they are questioning financial capital. <sep><sep> What I find, we get a lot of information and analysis. <sep><sep> And the slogan is becoming increasingly empty with globalized economy and later Mauritius selling with foreigners. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In terms of transportation, with the introduction of more one-man buses, congestion is also decreasing here. <sep><sep> In the meantime, he thanked Konntou because his mother told him that Konntou knows what's best for everyone. <sep><sep> Controlled by Capitalists, it exceeds the space it occupies. <sep><sep> This is the reason why we say that, when people are in a country, regardless of the country, here in Mauritius for example, they are mobilizing on a class basis. <sep><sep> He filled in important gaps in one place, and other things that were more of a "filler" in another place. <sep><sep> If you don't see what's happening in the country, what the economic situation is, what the situation of the working class is, if you call it a "good demand", we go ahead, we ask it. <sep><sep> Workers have sold out the working class and formed an alliance with the capitalist class in the country. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah replied yes, often they take a position for that kind of reason. <sep><sep> They, every Government, are for the capitalists in their own country. <sep><sep> They will only create, pour water and paint and decorate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For more than 30 years, Mauritius has relied on the sugar sector, and today the concept of "sugar area" is illegal according to the World Trade Organization. <sep><sep> It is arrogant, so that we can at the same time defend the interests of everyone - workers, men, women, youth. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin was the main speaker at the press conference. <sep><sep> He adopts a policy of "divide and rule": he officially entrusts the communal leaders, he is present in secular meetings, and in ceremonies that can fuel communal tensions. <sep><sep> We are in a period where a tiny political organization can lead to severe sanctions. <sep><sep> This series of paradoxes has given us an impression that the State is ageing. <sep><sep> And because in these circles there is generally a certain ignorance and contempt for Marx and a penchant for natural science history, they have accused Marx either of ignoring ecology or, worse, being an anti-ecologist. <sep><sep> Finance Minister Jugnauth also says that as many new jobs are created in schools every year. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, it is so expensive and inefficient that it will not be able to participate in the presidential election. <sep><sep> We note that Pravind Jugnauth is investing Rs20 million in a "Street Surveillance" system in Port Louis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> New language situations that are developing (meaning when we are going more towards writing in our own language), changing our relationships with everyone, while those who speak Creole, have been with our mother tongue. <sep><sep> But, it is not enough - for such a dynamic period in front of us. <sep><sep> Now, the Government no longer has the right to impose barriers to tariff protection for the national industry. <sep><sep> Discovering MES can mean that the state is committing a "genocide" in the same sense as it is defined in the United Nations Treaty Against Genocide. <sep><sep> Their mouths, spitting out saliva, foam on the asphalt boulevards. <sep><sep> 4 months later, I realized that some politicians, passing by, tell people that living in their sweetheart enables them to create an organization for them to get CSR. <sep><sep> They spent almost 1 week in Venezuela and 1 week in Cuba. <sep><sep> But all mistakes that the State has made new reside in all four possibilities that Rumsfeld did not think of but what Zizek(5) puts forward, that 'we don't know what we know', that is, the precise definition of an ideological unconscious. <sep><sep> And when he courageously engages with this machine, when he enters into a relationship with this machine, when he enters into a relationship with this primary matter, we have a production process. <sep><sep> Before even starting its implementation, conflicts are starting to arise between the National Energy Commission and CEB, to whom should the plan be presented? Is it the CEB, or the State? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Here is a piece of news: 10 members of MUVMAN LIBERASYON FAM distributed outside a large meeting that the Minister organized for 1,200 family associations in Mauritius on International Women's Day, Saturday March 8. <sep><sep> Apparently this money from Europe for a reduction in diesel prices is going only towards perpetual sugar plantations, to the detriment of job creation and food security; <sep><sep> For many years Lasinn has been emptying out since hosting world sporting events, like its products have been excluded since the American and European marches. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen explained this point: "The first thing we heard when the king removed the charge against Cehl Meeah is that the Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gayan, disagreed. <sep><sep> For the time being, his card is stuck in an area where Israeli and International volunteers are still entering. <sep><sep> However, Navin Ramgoolam brings with it the idea of "economic democratization". <sep><sep> The cashier took the form of an absence of recognition of natural science, the connection between man and nature, in the work of Marx. <sep><sep> And we have a program to prevent this type of fraud. <sep><sep> However, once CT Power seems to have abandoned, we start to get a more communal regrouping. <sep><sep> All this, against a backdrop of climate change, with our earth deteriorating, and our environment in general. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There were anti-democratic measures that Aneerood Jugnauth had imposed to prevent political parties from contesting elections, increasing corruption to a significant extent. <sep> The cost of living on the global market has decreased significantly this year. <sep> We say that the Government has a responsibility to create employment, to create more job opportunities, and to do it quickly. <sep> But after 40 years, we still haven't found a solution and the job market seems to be expanding, making it more difficult. <sep> Lalit has launched a campaign for solidarity against poverty with Lindsey and Ram. <sep> With a National Resolution to stop Child Labour! <sep> At the same time, the Resistance movement often opposes a more restrictive electoral reform, meaning the "Best Loser System". <sep> Workers have also been marked by a series of brutal incidents by the Police, with cases of beating, torture, and even killings by the police. <sep> During a conference on education, Lalit criticized the new curriculum presented by Gokhool "Towards a Quality Curriculum". <sep> So, comrades, workers, youth, women, men, farmers: Let's work together to create this movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government must deal with the problem of too much corruption, give Rama Valayden another appeal. <sep> "Some 33 years after the Constitution was drafted, one cannot escape the fact that a common way of Mauritian life has gradually and steadily developed in Mauritius, cutting across communal barriers. <sep> Even Diego Garcia, a military base controlled by a series of large companies, is intertwined with the State. <sep> In the last 10 years, the government has decided to start a Trade Union Trust Fund (TUTF). <sep> The dominating politics in current events since the beginning of this year, is the discussion of Electoral Reform and its connection with "consultations". <sep> Yesterday, when we saw the beginning of the MMM Alliance, when we read their banners, we find that they are focusing their campaign on "Subutex", not much more. <sep> Then you say you will make a transition between this and "global competition". <sep> Regarding employment, the only employment record created is 550 police officers and policemen. <sep> This means you need to be able to communicate your program, develop your program in the middle of the workforce, among workers, among the poorest individuals, so that the entire country knows what your position is. <sep> Departmental heads were making efforts to ensure that staff were functioning correctly. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a Gamma Coventa project to produce cyanide starting 10, the project seems to have disappeared after there was a protest of all kinds of interests. <sep> <sep> Um F. finds this job more difficult but more important for the women's movement in today's Palestine. <sep> <sep> The economic system says "sinking prices, the only way to move forward is to reduce expenses for licenses" This capitalist logic. <sep> <sep> There is a great distinction between the union struggle and the class struggle. <sep> <sep> So that working mothers have some flexibility when they have to welcome a new family member. <sep> <sep> It was a memorable evening with a good atmosphere that everyone enjoyed. <sep> <sep> According to the Marxist definition, "The State" is a bunch of institutions that have a small minority of people in a position where they can dominate a large majority economically. <sep> <sep> When we have chosen our candidates, we have tried to find a balance between militants with experience in different forms of struggle and new members who have all their will to serve in struggle. <sep> <sep> This amounted to Rs 3.2 billion for companies and this amounts to Rs 375 million in interest per year. <sep> <sep> Effectively a 6-year-old child has enough developed to know BICS, but his CALP is minimal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Republic of Mauritius is a large country, particularly because it contains about 2 million square kilometers of sea. <sep><sep> We need to introduce a second quota system where each Form 6 student gets an equal number of places in universities. <sep><sep> We were working on the issue of job security in the All Workers industry. <sep><sep> UNOCHA monitors checkpoints and other motor access points to control human and vehicle circulation. <sep><sep> Democratization means offering favors, and favors lead to favoritism, which in turn leads to corruption. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin also talked about the necessity of "movement" in a context where immobility is the norm. <sep><sep> There are 3 communities, he says, and all those who are not part of them are included in the General Population. <sep><sep> We are also working to build alliances with organizations in the UK and America. <sep><sep> LALIT's demands in programs on Ecology and Environment in October 2003 include very clear and specific requests regarding the positions Mauritius needs to take on the global stage. <sep><sep> Dev Virahsawmy was proposing an "a" with a circumflex accent for nasalization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Taking place on Ziz Balancy's same yard, he is currently supporting MAC work and Seetalsing's allegations. <sep><sep> On the board, you can find Revi from number 1 to 36. <sep><sep> There must be a union on the site (namely), there must be a delegate on the site. <sep><sep> It has consolidated our self-education that we gain in regular branch meetings, that we gain by knowing our neighborhoods, knowing our own site work well. <sep><sep> It has started in the same vein as Dr Doudou Diène from UNESCO, who also wants to avoid common patches. <sep><sep> So, there is an interaction between a political party giving instructions to the police, where you are promoting your program and people are criticizing your program, and bringing sanctions when necessary, when people convince you. <sep><sep> It's an old feather, if it used to be worth Rs 20, but now it's only worth Rs 2, but it still has a value in money. <sep><sep> Today if the vandal is still there, it's a self-criticism for all anti-criminal people. <sep><sep> The process to recognize a Palestinian state in the United Nations has started. <sep><sep> We have also decided to finally give a list of detainees who have died on police custody since 1979 in Mauritius, a list compiled by Lalit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, the WTO Tribunal issued a warning that subsidies provided by Europe on sugar production are illegal, penalizing sugar producers like Australia and Thailand. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the MMM-MSM government passed a law on GMOs in March 2004, providing a legal framework for the use and marketing of GMOs in the agricultural and food sectors. <sep><sep> We can learn a lot from Lenin and Trotsky on political party issues. <sep><sep> The ultimate goal of all union activists is to accelerate the development of class consciousness and unity among workers, and to foster a revolutionary will in the workers' movement. <sep><sep> Comrade Lindsey's criticized classification is a social security classification. <sep><sep> The bank has been increasing its overdraft fees from 1 million rupees (13 times the minimum wage of Rs6,000 per month for a worker) to 2.4 million rupees (the total income of some workers), turning it into a suffocating debt trap. <sep><sep> The school on 2 floors is almost completed. <sep><sep> LALIT recognizes the importance of the mother tongue and the political significance of pre-political work that Education for Workers does. <sep><sep> It is remarkable how when a President becomes President in America, they swear on the Bible; it is absolutely essential. <sep><sep> In the history of class struggle, workers can join forces and act almost by instinct. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He followed his routine according to tradition, put on his lenses according to tradition, said his prayers according to tradition, and behaved himself according to tradition. <sep><sep> Ecology, which means nurturing our earth, which allows humanity and all other species to live, is a fragile thing, it is in crisis. <sep><sep> But, has this nationalist idea not also been kidnapped by reactionary forces that make it confront what it could have been? <sep><sep> The Full Bench of the Supreme Court agrees that institutionalized communalism is not good (they say it is Lallah's fault). <sep><sep> Bananas are growing year by year! Banana plantations in the Two Mountains region are thriving. <sep><sep> Pressure from local bosses, international finance and the boss's ideologists <sep><sep> In this Scientific Queen article, we are examining how procedures (in medical) are done to make this kind of work - but without going into bureaucratic details. <sep><sep> Every day he spent three to four hours practicing reading and writing. <sep><sep> So, for LALIT, these 3 elements, the base, sovereignty and the right to return must be linked together in a single dynamic, in a single strategy. <sep><sep> But, we have begun to understand that we have put our hands in the dirt, fighting against police violence. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, there is a President of the Republic who is MSM, 6 Ministers, 6 PS. <sep><sep> We found this sickening in lessons that the resignations did not have a political purpose, there was no alternative. <sep><sep> - Don't you know your name? - I know my name but I don't know its meaning.<sep><sep> We also play a role in encouraging companies and bonus teams. <sep><sep> Increasing VAT / Implementing monetary policy to devalue the rupee that has led to an increase in the price of basic food items. <sep><sep> What seems to be happening is that the public library journals are going to have to pay a fee broken, and journalists and photographers are facing great difficulties in their work, due to a long-standing dispute between two former friends: <sep><sep> This is how we can externalize all of this, and maybe make progress. <sep><sep> Xavier Duval, the boss of this concession, seems insufficient to support his boss. <sep><sep> Arvind Boolell on his side, in an interview in Capital, said that he thinks Navin Ramgoolam should become a chief deta; <sep><sep> Symbolically, we can find him as a place where VOH and Kranti have become relatively more glamorous. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Second level: Where colleges from Form 1-5 also, each college will have its quota to enter College Form 6 which parents find as "first class". <sep><sep> And they describe the history of Chagos as a matter between America, England and Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> Meaning that by creating companies, businesses become more profitable. <sep><sep> From the beginning, at the level of LALIT, we have as the basis of our politics, class analysis, and class struggle. <sep><sep> Vote for Lalit to strengthen the strength of future governments and employers to rethink economic policies. <sep><sep> Contact JUSTICE by email or phone at 208-2132, 208-4074 to reserve a seat. <sep><sep> And everyone who comes to learn to read and write in LPT, it is helping in language development, in their preparation. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah said that Lamars Laliberte organizes it by the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a non-violent movement that takes direct action to support people against the illegal occupation of the State of Israel. <sep><sep> And to compare the supposed solutions that the Sithanese are offering with what Lalit is proposing. <sep><sep> Provocation to make the residents react and become reasons to justify the atrocity of Israel's and International actions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For a professional IT to pirate like this, it's serious. <sep> In 1992, Rajni Lallah and I were pursued by the police on PGA because we were demonstrating after the dismissal of 800 workers who were grouped in the CAWU union. <sep> On the other hand, Dr Ramgoolam knew that it was illegal for Great Britain to make that condition. <sep> In the last 3-4 years, Ramgoolam has become more and more trance-communal, and lobbying communal, including RSS, VOH, and Sanatan Dharma. <sep> his relationship with mass actions (as we are currently finding somewhat similar parties: Tunis, Egypt, Occupy Wall Street) and the appearances of mass actions (Wanted, etc). <sep> And when he puts himself in this position, he is absolutely easy for him to attack from abroad or from Lagos. <sep> So, the worker, when he works with this machine, he is not working with capital, he is working with the work of the workers before him. <sep> Because of communal polarization, and because of the polarization between the 2 Alliances through the corruption of the electoral system, because of their policies being so identical, we need to look at where a real opposition might come from after the general elections. <sep> Everyone must continue to work through the Internet, to make decisions on which language to choose, which stories to collect, select, prepare to publish, print, and how to distribute. <sep> This shows the danger in the strategy of Bloc 104, where what they say in sincerity in affidavits contradicts their political discourse. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 1981, MMM formed an alliance with PSM Harish Boodhoo to become a communal party and at the same time changed strategies. <sep><sep> They currently have influence on policies today, and they feel they have a duty to expose police brutality, the bourgeois system, and regime. <sep><sep> Reforms in the sugar industry are intended to continue to take good agricultural land to plant cane for ethanol and sugar production. <sep><sep> After Porto Alegre in Brazil, activists and movements that are fighting for a better world are gathering between January 16 and 21, 2004 in Mumbai, India, for the World Social Forum (WSF). <sep><sep> The position of MMM and PTR reflects that MMM is not very keen on the idea of Ramgoolam becoming President with power. <sep><sep> It is an ideal opportunity for us to promote our own Mauritian culture through our children. <sep><sep> In an interview with the media, it was stated that he did not need any checkpoints to get there. <sep><sep> While parliamentary opposition was in power with Nando Bodha leading the opposition, later on, Pravind even became a 'loyal' to Ramgoolam. <sep><sep> All these issues were exacerbated by the occupation after the latest Intifada. <sep><sep> And if the children are crying out at the end, you'll have to go to work for Rs12 per hour. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On IRA, the strike was illegal except for one which, for various reasons, became legal. <sep> <sep> Especially in the world, people were sending emails saying "I have been on a boat in Mexico, in France, ... I'm meeting the Flotilla". <sep> <sep> At that time, 3 police stations came to shoot them on Campus. <sep> <sep> General elections must be held before 2011, otherwise at the beginning of 2011 at the latest, he said, so we are already in a pre-electoral atmosphere. <sep> <sep> This fight is a class that is forward-looking, which has interests, capacity to bring this fight about because it conflicts with the capitalist class. <sep> <sep> Food crisis, energy crisis, ecological and environmental crisis, financial and economic crises, conflicts and wars between parties. <sep> <sep> So today we mainly support it especially to accompany these 2 families in case of problems and tears. <sep> <sep> Monday 18th September, in a Forum-Debate organized by the "Front Syndical de Gos" on the Employment Rights Bill and Employment Relations Bill, there were MMM and MSM present; as usual, MMM was represented mostly by more speakers than other parties. <sep> <sep> Bidze XLD has not proposed any alternatives to face the crisis. <sep> <sep> And it might seem like an ideogram, in its construction. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He did not propose a pharmaceutical industry, nor an industry to preserve and transform agricultural food products. <sep>

<sep> It was presided by Lindsey Collen and Ram Seegobin was the speaker. <sep>

<sep> The most important conclusion that Nadine Dutcher drew in her report on the experiences of using a first language (or mother tongue) and a second language in school, is this: <sep>

<sep> In the university, they have created another field called "Social-Economy" that doesn't just look at "economics" as a separate matter from the rest of society, or from other social sciences, but rather focuses on the "Economics" of the poor. <sep>

<sep> Pressure must be increased on Israel to stop the unrelenting blockade on Gaza that is leading to a humanitarian crisis for over a million inhabitants in that Palestinian enclave. <sep>

<sep> 75% of Palestinian enterprises have shutdown, and 98% of private wells have been destroyed. <sep>

<sep> News from the weekend is that as soon as the boss wants to start something, the disturbances begin. <sep>

<sep> This sabotage was carried out by the same politicians who were criticized by Lalit for being "compromised," because, unlike the private sector and the PMSD, they were openly pro-capitalist, pro-imperialist, pro-domination, and anti-worker. <sep>

<sep> It was narrated how the administrator of Savannah had placed SMF on him and how Ram Seegobin woke up one day at 4 a.m., and the way that administrator, Mr.  <sep>

<sep> First thing on the issue of no family doctor and how it is a problem for families because women have difficulty explaining their health problems to a male doctor. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It has this strategy called "economic democratization" - which actually benefits the state bourgeoisie, even though its propaganda is in favor of the workers, when it wants to do its demagoguery. <sep><sep> to ensure food security and create a sustainable export sector. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna had a plan, to succeed she had to go inside the citadel. <sep><sep> Where Lalit has 3 candidates, our vote has better effects. <sep><sep> We know that women will never get liberation under the capitalist system. <sep><sep> e.g Iraq's true resistance capacity, and what 'we don't know, we don't know' e.g. Iraq has Weapons of Mass Destruction. <sep><sep> They are doing their best to remove Beenick for this reason. <sep><sep> But it is difficult to accept that as a gift, as traders can import duty-free goods they buy on the world market, and sell them at the same price as before. <sep><sep> what it has become, despite its past, is that it has become, realized that there was a collusion between the Totalitarian government, the army, the police, and the establishment. <sep><sep> Pension is a right (not charity), and sorting is done in a righteous manner, within the taxation system. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, the crisis, which had been external, has become exposed as a systemic crisis within Mauritius. <sep><sep> On the other hand, LALIT emphasizes the need for electricity to be recognized as an essential service that is part of the basic needs of the population. <sep><sep> * The state is being accused of creating a social class divide by favoring one social class over others. <sep><sep> According to the law, if someone commits a sin, they may face up to 25 years in prison. <sep><sep> Can we accept that a nuclear power plant and a nuclear waste storage facility will be established and stored in the islands of Diego? <sep><sep> FSSC is distancing itself from PMSD, indicating that PMSD is losing strength against PT and MMM. <sep><sep> Ladan Williams further explains the modern advertising system, through which capitalist society has gained a monopolistic control over the spread of ideas via the media. <sep><sep> It is not surprising to find that, after a certain period of time, these same actual incidents in Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Yemen, Jordan are becoming prevalent in Mauritius. <sep><sep> This refers to the message left by LALIT at the British High Commissioner's office on April 7, at the same time as the protests. <sep><sep> Afghan refugees, after the bombings, have returned to a completely devastated economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The modern phase: Imagine a future where we repair the front, close the gaps, and reunify Mauritius?<sep><sep> And if we don't understand something, how will we be able to change it?<sep><sep> The state and employers have been using this capital, with the blessing of a silent trade union movement, to skillfully and expressly equip industrial establishments to lay off workers (through the Blueprint and VRS payment system) rather than creating jobs.<sep><sep> This is what happened in 1851 when President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte organized a coup against his own government and established a dictatorship.<sep><sep> Who has the right to negotiate and sign a binding agreement for all workers?<sep><sep> They have shown him a warrant card indicating that they are policemen.<sep><sep> There is a scandal involving the Bois de Rose container weighing on another leader.<sep><sep> The IRS (Integrated Resorts Scheme) project is converting thousands of acres of good agricultural land into vacation spots for international millionaires.<sep><sep> Worker Education has also called for the government to prioritize children's interests for their development and emancipation in the future.<sep><sep> The burning of forests could not prevent humanity from evolving. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie is imposing severe austerity measures in the face of an economic crisis, measures so harsh that they will precipitate massive suffering, less to say put an end to genuine political opposition. <sep><sep> Not alone, through a maneuver called a Historic Block (meaning a political party, mostly other classes, all amalgamated together through a few unifying points). <sep><sep> At the time, there was no single Creole professor to instruct, there were 83. <sep><sep> Workers' classes have entered as well in an autonomous and conscious way, under the leadership of Lalit de Klas. <sep><sep> At that time, all three strands of Lalit have been united. <sep><sep> Basically, we looked at the left side of the society: the conclusion is general Gokhool Reforms represents a great hurdle, if it manages to impose. <sep><sep> That occurs once every 4 or 5 years. <sep><sep> We made several requests, including enforcing the law to compel the private sector to develop its lands, and the use of European money in a process for restructuring the economy due to the global economic crisis. <sep><sep> However, not all their children were born in Palestine. <sep><sep> They launched an empty campaign based on communal-religious tactics. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since the 1983-84 period, LALIT has made it a priority to focus on the "economy" issue nationally. <sep><sep> We look at launching every election, preparing, taking positions. <sep><sep> Since its inception, Air Mauritius was associated mainly with the tourism industry in Mauritius. <sep><sep> It is increasingly impossible for anyone to keep saying that "most parents are against it". <sep><sep> All these young people who are gathering here are coming together to fight for a different world. <sep><sep> In the year 2020, wind power can provide 10% of global energy needs. <sep><sep> Why have we made a law that the quality of our lalit is to be supported. <sep><sep> This type of card can bring more corruption and abuse if used for election purposes. <sep><sep> We risk doing things that will not really advance us. <sep><sep> That means they have taken their fight to the highest level of the Court in London. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons prohibits the possession of nuclear materials. <sep> <sep> Even the Women's Associations' list, which predated the mentioned organizations, provided a platform for women to voice their concerns and gain access to resources that limited opportunities for those known by their names. <sep> <sep> Then resignations began after the Member Assembly which took place on the 4th of Ziyet. <sep> <sep> Extremely harmful to no longer be part of the metabolic cycle process, but it will do nothing but harm the River Thames. <sep> <sep> This means an election every 5 years (at least one midterm election) where each of the 21 constituencies elects their representative, then a ballot is cast. <sep> <sep> He said "We need to strengthen our alliance in the Zini Nation." <sep> <sep> We need to understand that this was a threat to society in general. <sep> <sep> How will we know? A passerby who mistook the location for a pleasure trip. <sep> <sep> An inappropriate example that MBC TV has already aired: "Saddam Hussein's nephew in a coma." <sep> <sep> Economics professors, too, are making students pass an exam. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In order to carry out all the work of the Revi program, political action on various campaign themes, strategic leadership on strategies, ensuring the recruitment of new members. <sep> They admit that Mauritius still needs to import 75% of its food. <sep> Then another member read an article from the LALIT DE KLAS review of February 1978, to see what has changed since a sympathizer described life here 30 years ago. <sep> Today, when we see problems arising at the level of food security, trade union movements are not questioning the logic of the capitalist system. <sep> Therefore, there is a conflict between the interests of workers and employers, which is a perpetual conflict that goes on, as it is not a new issue. <sep> A union is a gathering of all workers either in one company or in several companies, but people do the same quality of work. <sep> In a paper that the police have signed, it says that if it does not appear in court, there will be an 'arrest' against him. <sep> As I read it recently, he asked me if I wanted to have a drink. <sep> A LALIT election could only become a majority in a large heroic mobilization, as we were during the 1979 general strike movement. <sep> In this crazy speech, Minister Jugnauth presented a 5-year plan for 40,000 houses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is not about which we think should have repression against women, on sexuality and the reproductive role of women. <sep> <sep> Bizlall and FPU have come back to a group somewhat like NTUC, TUCC (Trade Union Consultative Council) which mostly replaces NTUC. <sep> <sep> There is a lake where the captain has gone to negotiate with the Government of Mauritius to fish. <sep> <sep> Do not shoot it where it is going so that it goes to consult its World Bank sorcerer to make decisions thereafter!! <sep> <sep> Not everything that is being done can be "natural". <sep> <sep> Where Eshan Khodabux and Jack Bizlall perhaps suspected anti-party, beginning of the 1980s. <sep> <sep> It is not our intention to look at all the labor laws in all details, it won't be so attractive. <sep> <sep> Lalit's representative, Lindsey Collen, has been delegated to receive this title in the name of all the participants in a reception that the Quito Amateur is holding on Monday, March 5. <sep> <sep> They say, when you have to work, start working right away. <sep> <sep> There was no group of militant internationalists who had planted themselves, with a program that could unify and train these puddles, to help the movement go further. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie has used their ideologies to carry out their work, especially ideologies since the Middle Ages. <sep><sep> In the 1960s and 1970s, there were lines of organizations and revolutionary movements in many countries, especially in Latin America and Asia. <sep><sep> When Pravind Jugnauth left, Navin Ramgoolam took over the leadership, making him number 4 - but Baichoo, too, is not a "true" Workers’ Leader. <sep><sep> Samazeste Dandouksingh Mahaking was not a very bad person. <sep><sep>  - 50 years is Enough - against the IMF-World Bank, symbols of financial capital and Washington plundering. <sep><sep> We have pleasure in receiving an email we got from a new reader of the LALIT Review, when he was presenting excuses because he was interested in participating in our Strategic Conference but could not: <sep><sep> We are already doing a lot of work, but now, we need to put more emphasis in encouraging more people to become active in the Party. <sep><sep> On 1st May, Labor Day, we had a debate - questioning and responses on the same issue. <sep><sep> What has happened is that the will to protest has been hijacked by opportunists for various sectoral demands such as the Sale by Levy issue. <sep><sep> And particularly to prevent democratic debates on ownership and economic control. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They need to live in a mirror that traps them in ghettos. <sep><sep> We find pleasure in directing MMM leaders such as V.Seenyen, J.Cuttaree, A.Ganoo, P.Naiken, J.de L'Estrac on a visit to gather information in America. <sep><sep> Like Moses guiding his people, take them into the Red Sea ghetto to lead them to the valley of Mozambique, the new Promised Land. <sep><sep> There could be hope for the Indian Ocean to be demilitarized because Diego is no longer "necessary for defending the West." <sep><sep> Felix, he receives an audit report saying he is bankrupt, he has more debt than assets, so, without further ado, he calls a meeting with the region's mayor, Mr. Didier Robert, owner of the property, and says he is proposing to wind up, declare bankruptcy, and close the company. <sep><sep> What makes them believe there may have been no significant improvements. <sep><sep> What truly characterizes them is that they were either against the 1979 Strike (some) or pretended to be part of it, but they were not truly involved in it (others). <sep><sep> We in LALIT are a political force that is capable of change, together, through our actions, and preparing for when the time is right. <sep><sep> Kamini knows how it all happened and why she decided to keep the baby even though she had all the facilities for an abortion. <sep><sep> From a big fat zero manz to zero, everything turned out to be a disaster my friend. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MSM-MMM alliance is responsible for passing repressive laws such as POTA which infringe on human rights and the rule of law. <sep> <sep> And I must say that the translation of foreign cultural productions is not sufficient. <sep> <sep> I am not looking into a crystal ball, but rather compensation, salary, rights, MMM for example, has ended up in its own downfall. <sep> <sep> It is in a form that is not necessarily positive but realistic. <sep> <sep> At the same time, we find a movement by Jean Claude de L'Estrac to prepare a political project around the same time a bourgeois group "bloque". <sep> <sep> A Minister, an official of the Government, who is Parliament, who is a United Nations Sinez with reasons that the Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> For children of Lakres, preschoolers and 5-7 years old who participate in what we call Early Morning, Afternoon and School Holiday Activities (EMASHA): <sep> <sep> The products in Merkal are 2-3 times more expensive than in private shops. <sep> <sep> Among them were Virginie Besage (45 years old), Noeline Selmour (41 years old), Renette Isai (29 years old), Louise Dorie Simon (52 years old), Patricia Lamb (18 years old). <sep> <sep> The governments of Tinizi and Lezip have fallen due to popular mobilization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another factor was the initiative of Pascale Lamy called "Anything but arms". <sep><sep> Documents released by Wikileaks have revealed a sinister conspiracy between the UK and US over this marine park. <sep><sep> On all applications, and on all applications listed: <sep><sep> It involves falling into a network of prostitution by rackets that make them pass for representatives of a kind human league. <sep><sep> Putting power back in the hands of the people, through the revocation of deputy by electoral petition. <sep><sep> When an artist and an organization are able to use their imagination, to confront a social problem in a new way, it is really destructive for the State to attack them with so much harassment. <sep><sep> There was also a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly for the State of Israel to demolish the wall following the judgment of Zizman. <sep><sep> Because the class war unfolds, it is through experience transmission. <sep><sep> Anyone who has a motorcycle, a car, is considered a lower class, and can circulate. <sep><sep> 2. The union struggle brings certain victories, which in turn bring confidence in the working class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During that time, the campaign of the Labour Party for the democratization of the economy and against Berenger, inflamed the communal atmosphere in the country. <sep><sep> There were also "2 Richards," meaning Richard Leontin and Richard Levins. <sep><sep> Why suffer now for a better tomorrow when we could live a better day. <sep><sep> So, when we look at it in 2012, the reflection is valid. <sep><sep> But, how can we act politically in a field dominated today by good "social work" and by civil society? <sep><sep> However, there was a missing link in the theory that Marx and Engels were developing: If the dominant class is overthrown because the ideologies of the dominant class are the dominant ideologies and this is accepted despite being a minority, how can we intervene there? <sep><sep> Today, Taher has become a major import and distribution company, especially for frozen food. <sep><sep> It has introduced Creole as a medium in its Pre-Voc schools. <sep><sep> This will reduce our dependence on fuel imports, protect the environment, create employment, and free up land for growing food instead of sugarcane for bagasse and ethanol. <sep><sep> Today, it seems that there are 3 self-proclaimed main leaders, 2 of them sitting with the Resistance & Alternatives. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this suggests that family life has a lack, often, of classroom life. <sep> What are the things that make it 2 years after, from a class policy, to go towards a policy of social consensus? There's a local lack here, it's true. <sep> This means that constant pressure over time from LALIT and other organizations, like Sant Idriss Goomany, like CTSP, like former President of the Republic Cassam Uteem. <sep> And we also need to ask the question, will workers like to strike for these demands? <sep> Because actions based on this kind of understanding in a common political situation will lead to actions in vain. <sep> Even though it's not so much about the development of a state bourgeoisie, the state bourgeoisie represents a level from a feudal bourgeoisie, a middle bourgeoisie, to a state bourgeoisie. <sep> What were the interests that Mr. Paturau represented during negotiations with British colonial representatives? <sep> So, we've found union actions supposedly "decomposing", terrible - especially "personal strategies". <sep> It avoids giving figures for food production growth in general, for example. <sep> hear his command and physical strength and it seems quite close. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain Ahvee has spoken about the need for a revolutionary political party that organizes a program. <sep><sep> Therefore, besides its limitation by nature, it also promotes democratization. <sep><sep> Sir Satcam Boolell, who was Minister of External Affairs at the time, said "The GM favored the textile quota over the academic debate on the Chagos Islands". <sep><sep> Nearly 30 years later, despite efforts before to integrate the environment into government ministries and programs, Mauritius has initiated the 'Mauritius Sustainable Island' program. <sep><sep> Through sharing small bits of information, connecting will lead to a better understanding. <sep><sep> The only responsibility that everyone (and it is significant) has is to change the system that causes these crises, as well as the industrial inequality. <sep><sep> Palestinian youth had their ID cards in their hands. <sep><sep> They said that there should not be a class difference between poor families and families with means. <sep><sep> Karen preferred to keep her thoughts to herself. <sep><sep> After a long campaign by Lalit, it is now clear that there must be an electoral reform that includes a replacement for the Best Loser System. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What was interesting was that Alain Ah-Vee had studied a shield that came out of lava, and bought it with a campaign of honesty that Lalit is organizing. <sep><sep> Now, the way the issue of reparations for slavery victims is being approached is absurd and communal. <sep><sep> It concerns an incident in 2002, when several policemen were in the private property of the Immaculate Church, Lower St George St. Paul, together with other members of Lalit, and with a group of members of twenty other organizations in front of PA BUSH. <sep><sep> Then during the 40th week, on the 5th day of the week, there were demands in front of the NRB, the workers followed all of this. <sep><sep> And often witnesses who finally began to explain torture, are rare individuals who are in a respectable job in the working class, either people they know, or brave women widows. <sep><sep> It is important to close the harbor at Port Louis to the presence of imperialist warships. <sep><sep> In addition, the government tactics to maintain its secret strategy do not have a big advantage. <sep><sep> The boss quickly discovered that I had an education and became interested in me. <sep><sep> And where it has succeeded, it must also be international. <sep><sep> These are the 3 things that determine working conditions when a person starts working. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now Minis P. Jugnauth is coming with a new plan: he is using all kinds of tricks to show that his plan is very different from what Sithanen and Ramgoolam proposed and that, Jugnauth, criticized severely when he was in opposition, even "disloyal"! <sep><sep> They say they notice that the presence of well-known people like writers, is not necessarily in Creole language. <sep><sep> This is serious, when the sector is threatened by single-operator bus, metro-light, CNT privatization. <sep><sep> The problem of predicting the unpredictable is that there are glitches (up to 5 years in the UN scenario) and at the same time, there are all kinds of dangers that cannot be predicted. <sep><sep> 800 union delegates from all syndicates in Mauritius were gathered on a resistance platform against the austerity measures following the FMI-WB reset plan. <sep><sep> They work in a closed chamber, they do not like the conditions, and they wait for better conditions elsewhere, they grumble. <sep><sep> It's also dangerous, because it gives the police a possible new strong position. <sep><sep> Before being in the DSP, he was already a member of the LCR when he was residing in France. <sep><sep> They also receive a lot of financial support from organizations in other countries, especially the US. <sep><sep> The EReB law is still being implemented as a barrier to prevent workers' rights from being eroded. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, the Labour is making his "communication team" (which was of Deva Virahsawmy and James Burty David, who have been replaced). <sep><sep> But, with the Labour from outside, even if MMM-PSM has won by 60-0, MMM did not feel safe. <sep><sep> It's a company and a property owner who had a long conflict over the issue of "later" in Grand Baie. <sep><sep> But, now we work as a political party, it is for all these frontlines, the sidelines, these articles in our program, our program which aims at this socialist finality, and to make it permanent <sep><sep> As for the Labour Opposition, Chady has resigned since the National Assembly, even though he had already resigned from Labour. <sep><sep> We are in a situation where there is a crisis in our economic system. <sep><sep> LPT, on our side, has made adult literacy in Creole, has trained teachers and trained their teachers. <sep><sep> You know capitalism has existed in a way where it's in power, for more than 250 years. <sep><sep> The Sea has organized this action as a visiting guide, hoping this would prevent armed interventions. <sep><sep> The International Crisis Area Ero has been reflected and caused many problems, starting in Africa. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the Grup Advance Agreement was signed, the Labour Party became a two-faced movement, where you get the working class, the laborer, the peasant, the proletariat. <sep><sep> Looking straight ahead, at the entrance, of the State of Israel that was built, it is 280 feet long and 24 feet wide. <sep><sep> Back then, when the Mauritian territory was disputed, the British were buying up all the sugar in Mauritius. <sep><sep> However, at that time, there was an internal conflict between labor movements, leading to fragmentation that had not been seen before. <sep><sep> Everyone agreed that it was necessary to save Earth's resources. <sep><sep> In this mobilization, which was gaining momentum, we were predicting the disaster that was happening in the security industry today, and we were mobilizing people together for a stronger establishment. <sep><sep> Those who criticize British politics, as it corresponds to their interests, their economic interests, their political interests. <sep><sep> Food security is an essential factor in serving a nation; And therefore, for the first

when he was Minister of Labor before 2005. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sorry, I've been talking a bit too much, but I'm a little lost. <sep> <sep> He takes the GWF (with his JNP), goes to one place. <sep> <sep> The badge represents the conflict between the two bourgeoisie, complicit between the two bourgeoisie, and then the alliance of the two bourgeoisie against the working class and poor people. <sep> <sep> Even though these words of Proudhon have a slight touch of clergy, their words are grand. <sep> <sep> LALIT is getting a good response in our campaign to build a parliamentary opposition based on our program. <sep> <sep> Certainly this money has been paid, what they took from the cash register to make desserts that all the family members bite into, often the whole family, remains calm. <sep> <sep> We all demand to implement our program together, and our work is to develop enough strength to start from where we are today in this very difficult situation in general for the working class. <sep> <sep> Willingly or unwillingly they eventually make physical progress so as not to make financial progress for women and children. <sep> <sep> This is how LALIT has put "alternative economics" on the political agenda for 10 years. <sep> <sep> In other words, workers find unions like something that has been excluded from them, it doesn't find the union as something for them. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have scheduled a meeting at 11:30 a.m on Saturday so that the family event can be done at the time when most people can attend and listen. <sep><sep> And it was created with less democracy yet in the traditional mainstream political parties, which is already minimal. <sep><sep> Maybe it's a moment to look at Reaz's question, if you allow me. <sep><sep> The celebration took the form of a reading by each poet in this key, each reading one of their own poems from the key: <sep><sep> The Alliance of Ker, why can't it be voted on as well? <sep><sep> Is it possible for you to live up to your promises in the short and long term? <sep><sep> So a small bourgeoisie who felt blocked organized itself on the Advance newspaper on a specifically communal basis. <sep><sep> In 2001, Lalit reiterated its demands and furthermore we demanded that Mauritian companies that have benefited from compensation to abolish slavery in 1835 should return the equivalent of that money into a Post-Slavery Fund. <sep><sep> It started to organize a single conference – a “one off”, but over 3 - 4 years, it operated. <sep><sep> There is an academic arsenal, a journalistic arsenal that is listened to by the world, a bourgeois ideological arsenal, a think-tank arsenal, which tries to counter its philosophy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, before that, according to what Lindsey just said, there is a class struggle that is currently unfolding. <sep><sep> The American economic crisis is continuing to worsen as it is spending more than it has, and it is spending on non-productive, but destructive materials. <sep><sep> The question of "ideology" remains quite complex, in a specific manner. <sep><sep> The class struggle is pleased to invite all visitors to our website to visit www.lalitmauritius.org instead of www.lalitmauritius.com. <sep><sep> Editorials by Raj Meetarbhan on September 6 and 13 and Lindsay Riviere on September 9 and 16. <sep><sep> There's also a small book that LALIT has published this week, if you prefer to have it in book form. <sep><sep> On February 1st this year, although it wasn't very successful, it was present at the LALIT Congress. <sep><sep> In the last general election, Navin Ramgoolam said he was looking to gain a 3/4 majority in Parliament. <sep><sep> We criticize this, because in fact the only solution lies in the organization of POLITICS, in creating a political party. <sep><sep> Another paper will be on Language and Education, and one on the concept of "internationalism". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before they left, they slaughtered all the animals they had here, and burnt all productions so that the English/French would not get them. <sep><sep> Year after year, we have seen MMM maintain this deviation from a party representing the aspirations of the people for a socialist society to a party representing the interests of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> There were two Palestinians waiting for their IDs from the soldiers at Checkpoint. <sep><sep> Dr. Neville Alexander and Dr. Carole Bloch from the Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa (PRAESA), University of Cape Town (UCT), were the initial coordinators of the STAAF Workshop. <sep><sep> It is also noteworthy that the PMSD maintained ties and supported the pro-apartheid regime in South Africa. <sep><sep> This is how the British government managed to establish a new colony, which it called the British Indian Ocean Territory. <sep><sep> Here is the programme awaiting us until 2015 to confront the crisis! <sep><sep> The Social Alliance and the Government, while seizing opportunities to expand the state's bourgeois economic base. <sep><sep> INFO INFO INFO Flight to LALIT Good morning, Monday 15th October, very early in the morning, the thief fired shots at the shutters, broke the big glass window next to the LPT Building. <sep><sep> So it set up a Development Bank and through this Development Bank, the government can use public money to finance the development of different industries in favor of its social base. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Remember that in the last general elections of 2000, Lalit managed to bring the issue of privatization to the forefront as a major point of contention in the electoral campaign. <sep><sep> We cannot understand why we are still living like slaves to a job, that is, to the site of work. <sep><sep> It is not just about supporting, it is multiplying, and when we share what we bring collectively, it generates extraordinary wealth and it is this wealth that makes a program possible. <sep><sep> One evening after dinner, he agreed to spend the night with Sir Ralph at a hotel. <sep><sep> And, when we are advocating for fertilizers and insurance to plant vegetables, just like planting sugar cane, we have members who have experience in planting, present, to tell us how easily they gain or do not gain. <sep><sep> That means, Ram says, we used to know the situation on the ground. <sep><sep> In 1994, 10 years ago, he won the same prize for his novel "The Rape of Sita". <sep><sep> Scandalous stories, shocking photos, funny and sensational incidents became everyday. <sep><sep> Sony was a major element from this creation. <sep><sep> After the departure of Madun Dulloo from the Government, 2 other allies are weakening Ramgoolam: MR and PMXD. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It benefits greatly from all the knowledge and experiences that each individual has and that we share together in our

<sep> You cannot let society be controlled by people who exploit you, you can't let governments exist to control you, but when a system is in place. <sep>
<sep> For example the ideology 'either lib' we find it in practice like voting, shopping or in choosing a partner. <sep>

<sep> Lindsey Collen introduced a session with an analysis of the Palestinian issue in History to understand more deeply what is happening today and to understand the tragedies and bombings of Gaza by the Israeli State. <sep>
<sep> We proposed a transformation in the context of the Constitution reform that Mauritius follows the example of Ecuador and does not allow any foreign military bases on its territory by law. <sep>
<sep> there is "unprecedented dancing", in the Security Industry there is a need to "save" the sector, and the Tourism Industry is "facing difficult times". <sep>
<sep> The government has acted like a "little toddler" in front of the imperialist Americans on the issue of terrorism and invasion of Iraq. <sep>
<sep> On the issue of internationalism, I said in practice, we have attended several conferences, from Sydney to San Francisco, to South Africa simply to tie those political links and other political forces. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have a job to do, we need to find ways to get the equipment to do this job before we move forward. <sep> In Le Mauricien of the 23 of August, Ashok Subron said that the Lalit party leadership has never faced any reproach for the way he has "erased the union file". <sep> This is truly a move towards private medicine, a shame. <sep> We are discovering that Chagossians are not considered Mauritians when they are so beautiful and truly Mauritian. <sep> However, his supporters congratulated him for the beating, saying "He had to beat!" and all the police have to beat! <sep> Today, the MMM is starting to resemble the PMSD and other municipal leaders in the 70s. <sep> Is it in the midst of a political and institutional crisis less democratic for power to be concentrated in the hands of the army rather than the people, as with the President? <sep> But I also decided to participate in the education and language commission, the Diego commission, and the union commission because these are the issues that interest me. <sep> However, I believe that in Mauritius, we all Mauritians have an extraordinary responsibility. <sep> Israel continues to violate international law after its army bombed Gaza. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The law and the system prevent it from having a relationship with what it has produced through its own courage, except through money. <sep><sep> The commercial press has a monopoly on deciding what to publish or not publish for society as a whole. <sep><sep> And finally, they convinced environmental NGOs to support a "Marine Park" there. <sep><sep> When they are convinced of a profound political action, they have the power to influence the working class that we just mentioned, particularly because they are included in everything. <sep><sep> Sometimes there is a case of a blue-blood-red, "blue" that is the problem. <sep><sep> Another contradiction was when Dev Virahsawmy chose Yvan Martial as the speaker for the launch of his artistic collection, then his guest spoke out against Creole language in a grotesque manner. <sep><sep> But, the former MMM-MSM and Lalyans Sosyal Government made plans, but plans that can face guaranteed net disappearance. <sep><sep> This is done not in the name of the working class, but in the name of planters, especially large planters who want to participate in “cluster” refining, distilling, electricity production, and its IRS partner. <sep><sep> And after a long time, they realized that if every plantation that suffers from this exploitation bankruptcy is allowed to act alone, it won't go far. <sep><sep> Twelve years after their marriage, they decided to have their first child. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> LALIT had criticisms against Minister Gokhool for his competitive project, as well as against the first draft of the Bunwaree Plan in 2009. <sep><sep> This seems to be a bigger victory than Sandra O Reilly has given us. <sep><sep> It appears that on Tuesday 2nd October, the fateful date, if a vote cannot be obtained by two-thirds of Parliament (Representatives and Senate) to raise the ceiling for debt, there must be an exception measure. <sep><sep> Group A4 composed of Joelle Husseiny (vocals), Rajni Lallah (keyboards), Clifford Boncoeur (guitar), and Steve Desvaux (bass). <sep><sep> And when we are invited to a radio program, there too, we take advantage of having the same experience. <sep><sep> They are more concerned with shooting their comrades and at the same time have some bureaucratic personal interests! <sep><sep> But when the police say 'Let me look into the box', then they find parcelgrams, they bring you to the station, give you a case, bring you back, you get a case. <sep><sep> For Althusser, ideologies are imaginaries and representations of the reality of individuals. <sep><sep> The "tax holiday" for Freeport employers, which was supposed to end in 2013, is being perpetually extended. <sep><sep> He set up this challenge, but he did not finish saying it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Faith47 is a graffiti artist based in Cape Town, South Africa. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the strategies used in the British courts, which Olivier Bancoult has been following since 1998, have reached a total deadlock. <sep><sep> Q: A question on the kind of light like LITRA was: it seems like a truly inspiring action. <sep><sep> Rada Kistnasamy made a very precise assessment of the content of our mobilization campaign, and she talked about the 5 points on which Lalit has agreed last year. <sep><sep> I am saying "conscious", not "conscience", just drop the "s" for the moment, "conscious" as in a simple sense. <sep><sep> So today we say "No to all lawsuits against Jameel Peerally and the social worker organizing this screening." <sep><sep> When Minister Mohammed withdrew his amendment, each union bureaucracy has been more open, claiming paternity for this "victory". <sep><sep> We believe that there is no connection between "the economy" and "the social." <sep><sep> Paul Berenger, on the other hand, has stepped into a "conference speaker" role, a role he had played for a long time, not too sure if he can pull it off anymore. <sep><sep> Bacterial infections vary greatly in severity, and often present as an epidemic: there was a gastro-enteritis epidemic as we experience in the summer caused by a group of bacteria called Coliform: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is based on the short, medium, and long-term goals, regardless of the actions we take. <sep><sep> The second point in this 10-point plan is a reduction in both production quotas, principally by decreasing minimum wages, meaning a decrease in purchasing power. <sep><sep> Instead of fighting Cehl Meeah politically, Berenger is now only fighting him electorally. <sep><sep> There have been protests in Africa and Asia, even against the violence. <sep><sep> Then we enter into the old argument, to agree, disagree, maybe in a second time, when all points have been clarified. <sep><sep> But with a surface area reduced from 72,000 to 65,000 hectares. <sep><sep> And this will, in turn, create an economic imbalance in places where refugees are found due to a lack of resources, and consequently this may lead to conflicts and wars. <sep><sep> This means that these strictures formed during the strike are important because they provide a means for workers on strike to decide their demands. <sep><sep> We made this decision 15 months ago. <sep><sep> The MSM managed to elect 6 of its candidates. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It had a vision of a new kind of society to put an end to exploitation and domination. <sep><sep> 07th of August 2011- MSM resigned from the government because they were being "suffocated" for 14 months within that coalition. <sep><sep> So, the workers managed to bring a conscious, collective, highly-advanced struggle at the workplace, and this has been taking place since 1970. <sep><sep> "For selecting the articles of this book, it was not easy, because in almost every LALIT article, there is a paragraph. <sep><sep> Meaning, it starts with a cost, in 3 cases, with the same base point, then when the environment starts changing, it's completely different. <sep><sep> While Mauritius is facing a systemic crisis like that currently unfolding, a role like that of Lalit is to develop a program that takes as a starting point the reality of today. <sep><sep> but a vastly greater number of people among the workers and others in society whose lives, they too, suffer from the capitalist system. <sep><sep> It itself creates, but it wants to respect it. <sep><sep> When you negotiate significantly with the World Bank, it's not just pressure you endure, but you must have an "ear" to the ground! <sep><sep> What is the motivation behind this proposed 39% discount price? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Likewise, we must launch a true campaign for the pleasure of countering the British government and the Chinese State. <sep><sep> This is the reality of the declining world, in all sectors. <sep><sep> Like in modern society today, what people are doing, every day, round us, is reproducing themselves. <sep><sep> It comes directly from the PMSD security that has long represented the interests of this wealthy oligarchic seafarer. <sep><sep> Ultimately, it is the Minister of Labor who imposed this 19% figure, but in a negotiation involving only the CNT. <sep><sep> Before the 2010 elections, MMM appeared to have faded away completely. <sep><sep> Everywhere, there was no correct way to fill a void. <sep><sep> MMM, MSM, UN have come together in a massive mobilization to overhaul a DWC worker center. <sep><sep> and especially by putting the emphasis on our 2 central demands in our program that can exceed this deadline that includes sitting for the reintroduction of the national ranking for the CPE and the introduction of A+. <sep><sep> Lindsey has allowed us to look at and understand the documentary in more depth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The lottery is held at a distance from the residence. <sep><sep> And when the system is in crisis, many people in intermediate classes easily slip into lower classes, they find themselves without work, face difficulties, and the number of workers increases. <sep><sep> This, the perfidious British State itself, but that is not its reason. <sep><sep> Remember that the elections were supposed to be held in 1972, but then the Labor Party, Bolom Ramgoolam, changed the Constitution to postpone the elections for another 4 years. <sep><sep> We agree with this type of system, where there is a deputy attached to the constituency, but we propose that there be 4 deputies per constituency, 3 deputies for Rodrigues and one symbolic deputy for Chagos until it becomes real. <sep><sep> Inflation, exaggerated electricity prices, threats of price hikes in stores, are leading to impoverishment. <sep><sep> All these financial sectors that have caused problems in Lagos, Ireland, Spain, and its 22% profit. <sep><sep> Because this is the State that needs to govern, in this State, this State has done, has existed to represent both interests: <sep><sep> In that time, we also had other “deep” forces that supposedly contributed to the bourgeois plan to gain political representation. <sep><sep> It is no longer where you think it should be. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At night, the control tower in the village entrance has a rotating beacon <sep><sep> We do not agree with these kinds of tricks. <sep><sep> He has delivered his first lecture on "socialism". <sep><sep> Capitalists in different economic sectors have relative strengths compared to other capitalist sectors; it depends on several factors. <sep><sep> When workers elect the Committee, elect the President, all those elected continue to receive the same salary as all workers. <sep><sep> But when you bring up the debate about CT Power, when you bring up arguments favoring CT Power, they tell you that this is economic democratization. <sep><sep> We did not participate because we do not agree to become accomplices to this operation that is happening, especially where MMM is involved; people forget that it has made a class of workers. <sep><sep> It is often said that when the political situation becomes boring and everything becomes trivial and turns into a joke, in Lalit, we hope to focus more on what affects people's lives and what is more serious for the moment. <sep><sep> For some time now, the parliamentary opposition and the media in general have been running a permanent campaign on the issue of fraud and corruption: every week there is a new scandal. <sep><sep> In contrast to the Workers, MMM had won 80% of its tickets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 17 men were arrested for 2- hours in the village of Jame'en. <sep><sep> There, there was a course in favor of the consolidation of the Soviet State, in favor of "socialism in a single country" represented by Stalin. <sep><sep> Where do the "intellectual powers" exist in Mauritius, where do they stand? <sep><sep> But the Communist Party and the People's Republic of China have reached an agreement with the Tibetan clergy to preserve their social system based on a system of peasant language and at the same time to ensure the domination of the Buddhist clergy. <sep><sep> Today Mauritius is not using its mother tongue in its resurgence efforts. <sep><sep> A PC has been completely closed down, as in Australia. <sep><sep> We have retained many good traditions that have developed in LALIT over time: we held our 1st May Labour Day celebrations together with several other organizations;<sep><sep> everywhere.'

who work closely with us, equally. <sep> <sep> They may be against the BLS but sometimes they are against only candidate classification. <sep> <sep> all our supporting members who have actively participated in our activities and supported our work. <sep> <sep> When we speak, there is news: the National Union has collapsed today. <sep> <sep> In response to questions about opposition party forms, Rajni Lallah said there have been two types of protests. <sep> <sep> No expert in education would say the contrary on this matter. <sep> <sep> As bureaucracies, by their nature, they must truly reflect the will of the majority. <sep> <sep> Then, this "zig" is overturned by another "zag" when Navin Ramgoolam, for not one but several reasons, begins to explain why his father had already taken Xavier Duval out of the alliance and coalition in the past. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is why the Labour Party calls it "democratization of the economy", and this is why they explain what the Labour Party represents today. <sep><sep> We have a document to criticize the Government's White Paper, which we will popularize during the campaign. <sep><sep> Whether it's cartoonist Le Defi, Abdul Calla (L'Express) or Deven T., they all manage to keep up with current events while following historical trends. <sep><sep> Because there is no democratic control over union leadership. <sep><sep> And within the family, there is a tendency to have a fairly authoritarian boss, with his younger brothers and sons beneath him, then each family, child. <sep><sep> In FCM, we have already found investors like Armand Maudave (in the sugar mill management) together with unionists and factory workers like Mario Flore. <sep><sep> The punishment of the natural power of LALIT, we belong to a political tradition that finds political strategies quite different. <sep><sep> It means contrasting with what he had said before 1981. <sep><sep> Jean Claude de l'Estrac, new Minister of Foreign

collectively in it during a modest era, in a modest place, but in it. <sep><sep> And when this only becomes popular, as long as it is unconscious, and as long as it cannot turn the tables on the power in place, it brings about repression in certain countries. <sep><sep> Remember that recently, Prime Minister Berenger gave the same kind of signal to the RIOT when he said they are not there to "feed frozen yogurt". <sep><sep> When they leave villages, they set off a tear gas bomb in the village square before they leave. <sep><sep> The same goes for the Seychellois a billion for "food security". <sep><sep> And, at the same time, we commit ourselves, in the current context of electoral reform and constitutional sanctions, and facing the imperialist and private capital aims on the various islands and territories of Mauritius, to work towards providing a concrete form of Chagossian representation in a democratic set-up of the Republic of Mauritius, as an archipelagic state; and to amend the Constitution to prevent any military bases from being set up on the territory of Mauritius in the future; <sep><sep> There are 2 types of cyclical crises in the capitalist system, a short and a long one. <sep><sep> And it is production that allows society to survive and reproduce itself. <sep><sep> Since independence, the historical block that PT built was mainly focused on almost all social classes in the security industry, a sector that has been the backbone of the economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and other parties such as the Republican Movement but also other dog organizations like the First May Movement. <sep><sep> Moreover, since February 1999, there has been a movement calling for increased financing from employers and the government for NGOs and trade unions. <sep><sep> In order to have a certain level of decency in prison, and for prisons to be linked with society in general, prison guards must have the power to offer incentives to inmates who behave well. <sep><sep> There are also many things that do not follow exactly like that. <sep><sep> After another 2 years, the last one received his ID but he is not allowed to cross the sea. <sep><sep> Regarding Diego Garcia, the Mauritian government has finally acted, even if it is a bit funny, that is through the UN Convention on the Seas, it is still an initiative. <sep><sep> But, only in LALIT, we find that when the government is introducing Creole as one language only, and Bhojpuri as one language only, it's not enough. <sep><sep> The way Lalit brings a consciousness among its members, we all work together in preparing our PROGRAM. <sep><sep> If you are squatting on a plot of land, they will take a bulldozer and destroy it. <sep><sep> But, he prefers to subsidize his

<sep><sep> They asked, "If we have organized a strike for a week in the sugar cane field and in the textile industry, and it is a success, will you join in solidarity in the second week?" <sep><sep> The newspaper did not take a particular stance on the main loser in this meeting. <sep><sep> In general, a two-week break every year is guaranteed for every worker (15 days per year of service). <sep><sep> 'Mauritianism' is a concept that can accommodate both employers and employees, but it is the employer who benefits the most. <sep><sep> Now there is a new form of industrial relations, as if we can really make progress. <sep><sep> In some countries, such as Cameroon, there are almost 200 different languages, while in others (Rwanda, for example) there is one that is widely spoken. <sep><sep> ICAC issued a warning to Mrs. Hanoomanjee when she had not presented her account. <sep><sep> One of the leaders of Lalit gave an interview when the newspaper avoided any reference to the fact that Lalit had candidates in the election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You must be ready to enter the five-minute space if there is a coral reef in the night for the presence of international students. <sep><sep> LALIT came into being in 2 waves: But 75 student wagons and the strike of 1979-80, a wagon of worker class who stood up. <sep><sep> and the strong base on Diego becomes central in the NO US BASES assembly, in the great anti-war movement and in the altermondialization movement. <sep><sep> On 12 points in his report, there are 5 points that are only for reforming reports against autopsies that Dr. <sep><sep> Some called him Uncle Timi because they did not realize that 'appa' was his special name that his brother and sister used to show respect for an elder. <sep><sep> For us in LALIT, we think it is an opportunity to remind us that Independence concerns the process of decolonization and today our territories are still under occupation. <sep><sep> So, today, we are trying to keep that perspective, and we are not thinking about working among our own sectors, working on our own website. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin spoke about this deleterious trend for analyzing bids by separating the economy from 'social'. <sep><sep> It is not possible that someone with capital does not create employment. <sep><sep> then everyone does their campaign by an advertising system, marketing, where the buyer must be convinced that it is better than the others. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And unfortunately the Mauritian State had to accept to put a duty on its sovereignty over Diego, when Paul Berenger accepted to put "dotted lines" to delineate Diego in the Pelindaba Treaty. <sep><sep> When we look at its people, it is a city. <sep><sep> Until there are 470 IRS villas and 125 RES projects. <sep><sep> Slowly but surely it began to seem clear that there were some very corrupt individuals in government circles, politicians like top officials who were willing to let the situation deteriorate. <sep><sep> This has been going on since February 2011, as there was a moratorium 2 years after ERA. <sep><sep> Such immense difficulty in organizing a union in such a sector. <sep><sep> In general, it is a system where primary schools allocate admissions to secondary schools, and colleges allocate labor admissions to tertiary schools. <sep><sep> People who know best about this group are Jules Koenig. <sep><sep> They come with their "boss" in a convoy, maybe in a truck, start looting on a large scale, store it for themselves, intending to keep it, and then sell it only after the situation has calmed down. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, also preparing what we believe can replace the disaster we are facing today in Mauritius and in the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We used to give credits to the Paedar King team for the TV show Lairland. <sep><sep> But today, there is a political crisis in the working class that weakens their strength since the working class is poor. <sep><sep> This means that, through our global movement and here, we are making America and Great Britain pay a political price. <sep><sep> It is in a sector with a lot of experience, so it knows that it is hurting its supervisors, it is hurting the boss. <sep><sep> Today, with systemic crisis this kind of size is becoming a reality. <sep><sep> Because these universities, they are financed, ultimately, on a class basis. <sep><sep> Those who are foreign to it are the Paloma sensation from its seasonal status with a recognized family, beautiful, and a television, but on condition that she returns with livestock and not with the great proprietor Diego who is the main character. <sep><sep> WE HAVE THE MEASURES THAT ARE PROPOSED TO DO THE FILMING PRODUCTION BY MAKING THE MINDSET ESTABLISHED BY THE MEN MARSE: <sep><sep> Members of the Family Liberation Movement, Education for Workers and Health Improvement Committee were present in court. <sep><sep> * But so that there is no permanent crisis in bourgeois society, there is also another kind of 'state' of the State that is currently spreading ideas that have a capitalist system in place. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Do you think that we should use this money from Europe to consolidate food production? <sep><sep> A note on the role of the press: Sometimes when activists speak about "political scandals" that the "press" while as an institution has, the editors react with much anger. <sep><sep> He did not agree with the political orientation of his mother because she had to support the Prime Minister's party that was doing everything to preserve ancestral culture. <sep><sep> For the general elections, we are developing demands that will transform our lives: <sep><sep> There are great penalties in justice with a new Chief Justice and a new DPP. <sep><sep> The success of this penalty also depends on the training of teachers so that their pedagogy benefits this improvement. <sep><sep> It is not possible for the government to allow establishments to close mills, and to outsource labor and artisans. <sep><sep> Also, in passing, we must mention that it shows the role of the media. <sep><sep> Everyone thought we were crazy when we brought the light against, when my friends and I were arrested by the police at 18. <sep><sep> This shows the value of a Family Commission that can intervene when there is an attack against the family. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Camera, mobile phone, notebook, and all important phone numbers in case of an emergency. <sep><sep> The farmers say that although the situation seems to be improving, there is still a major issue in certain areas where the settlers have the right to pass through Kfar Tappuah colony and where they are not allowed to pass. <sep><sep> There were students with "formation" experience in the countryside, there were new workers who had just started working, and there were more experienced workers. <sep><sep> And in some cases, it even encouraged a clear political leadership. <sep><sep> * I met in Biddya another land rights activist who explained to me in detail the process of establishing electoral lists for each locality, village, and city. <sep><sep> Um F. announced that today there are 6 checkpoints from Nablus to Hares. <sep><sep> The Republican leader of the House, not long ago, said, "What's the problem, we Americans get the goods, the others take our paper?" This was before the crisis. <sep><sep> Another thing they do to get out of it is to completely destroy (through bombings and camps in general) to ensure they start their arm industry and provide arms for their army. <sep><sep> Sometimes they were way too advanced for their time. <sep><sep> During the LALIT Members' Assembly in late 2011, Ram Seegobin spoke about the local and international political situation in 2011. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And when you bring this bed, you are advancing class struggle, vis-a-vis capitalist class. <sep><sep> Before Bolom Ramgoolam there was the Plantation Workers’ Union and AGWU with him, he gave many advantages to certain para-state para-state movements, more he guarded the planters as his political heirs in the villages. <sep><sep> In addition, there are also Week-End and Week-End Scope, more website www.lemauricien.com. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is propaganda like workers can get zero compensation from January 2011. <sep><sep> In America, 8 Republican candidates, one by one, are putting their past aside or their morals become public. <sep><sep> When he was a child, as beautiful as he was, a place where people in the village could come and go freely. <sep><sep> So much has the presence of military bases been accepted that there have been Mauritian Governments that have allowed military aircraft to come to Mauritius every Sunday morning, providing aircraft, preserving fish, vegetables, meats, and frozen fish. <sep><sep> what are we doing about a great progress if everyone can really become, in a future that we hope won't be too far off. <sep><sep> What has happened by 1990 is the culmination of a series of decisions the government has taken since 1982: <sep><sep> Only one student who has been studying "economics" at college realizes that he has been deceived. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The majority of the population is involved, they don't really have a political conscience. <sep><sep> He wanted to control establishments, and the largest union of workers, the Artisan Union of the Sugar Industry. <sep><sep> But now, in the future, according to the Balancy system, candidates do not need to classify themselves, so if there is a candidate who does not classify himself within the first 4, he can go into the 5th. <sep><sep> You see, what the British gave to the Zini State for Diego Garcia and Chagos, it was a 50-year lease. <sep><sep> They don't really criticize the economic policies that are affecting the working class so much. <sep><sep> We need to have a different approach to make this happen. <sep><sep> The TFSVG (Trust Fund for the Social Integration of Vulnerable Groups) survey on 525 families occupying NHDC housing shows that one out of five is living on less than Rs 4000 per month. <sep><sep> In a pre-revolutionary period, that is just before a socialist revolution, there is a period called the "dual power" period where workers and oppressed people begin to establish new power structures. <sep><sep> This dynamism will continue in society. <sep><sep> And we focus on how Bidze was just located in reality in these serious crises that will continue to happen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Could it be used to renovate the hospital facilities as the MSPA proposes, meaning VRS funding? <sep><sep> Only after the 1991 and 2000 elections did we see that there were MMM and MSM alliances. <sep><sep> For some time now, ultra-liberal ideologues have been trying to turn health, education, and justice into commodities that need to be bought. <sep><sep> But proposing a debate on a program for an alternative economy that does not depend on sugar and textile, which can bring about the creation of jobs quickly. <sep><sep> But the military intervention of the Sri Lankan army is making it much more difficult to find a political solution to this conflict. <sep><sep> - Did he leave you? The Englishman was full of arrogance. <sep><sep> They only talk about securing things from within their bubble. <sep><sep> And what's more, he believes in the sugar industry and wants to support it, even though it represents only 2.9% of the economy. <sep><sep> After centralization, VRS, and the closure of textile factories, only "Bérenger's method for calculating anomalies" can explain this quality anomaly in numbers. <sep><sep> We call them bourgeois political parties because they represent bourgeois interests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So it's not surprising that he didn't propose any measures. <sep><sep> He was not responding to the current economic crisis. <sep><sep> This is because he saw the need to prepare and create a dynamic that could lead us towards a popular demand for an alternative agricultural and agro-industrial culture, which would create employment. <sep><sep> You know, when there is a strike movement, when there is a general strike over a period of time, when you have developed strictness. <sep><sep> What happened after, no one knew well. <sep><sep> There, what they were bringing about the French Revolution, they said "Revolution", would gradually abolish a clear class. <sep><sep> We also note that there are several ex-MR Rama Valayden, especially in the lumpen and sub-proletariat, who have found work as gardeners in social centers and in sports centers in different neighborhoods of Rose-Hill. <sep><sep> Yesterday, the representative of the Youth Group in the Central Committee of the party, Alex Ng, said that he agrees with this suspension measure. <sep><sep> But they are going in the direction of decriminalizing abortion when they say that there shouldn't be repression against women, but there should be women's emancipation. <sep><sep> The launch in English, French, and other languages will continue the same way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a Radio One program last week led by Darlmah Naeck, Ram Seegobin for LALIT talked about the importance of agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> For example, during the feudal period, a bourgeoisie began to emerge, but this bourgeoisie had to finish accumulating capital, it had to fight against the monarchy. <sep><sep> Automatically, the prices of goods and services were going up. <sep><sep> The depletion of the planet's resources led to water scarcity, rising sea levels, and the depletion, erosion, and desertification of soils. <sep><sep> In this sense, when we work in organizations that we, we call "pre-politics" we give a political dimension to this work. <sep><sep> There was a secret transaction of Polaris missiles between the UK and the USA. <sep><sep> The feudal system in Europe, it was a form of modern day slavery. <sep><sep> In 2010, Ashok Subron, negotiator for the Joint Negotiating Panel (JNP) of the sugar industry union, claimed that Navin Ramgoolam had called him on his phone for negotiations that led to the "historic agreement" giving a 20% increase in wages to sugar industry workers. <sep><sep> The Central Committee report, the activities of the party, which sectors are developing, focusing more on current affairs, reveals the proposals of the Central Committee. <sep><sep> This feeling of revolt that exists, we hear people talking about it, especially when people cannot repay their debts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The fact that in NTUC there are mainly 2 federations influenced and manipulated by political parties is somewhat worrisome. 
<sep> Specifically, the FDI has managed to benefit from speculation on land value, meaning they are making "windfall gains" on agricultural land in the IRS zone, as they have allowed establishments to convert and develop agricultural land. 
<sep> Therefore, it is possible for all government officials to develop this kind of "ethos". 
<sep> We have not made any progress on this issue, but the poor "civil society", NGOs, unions have goals in this regard. 
<sep> This is why ideas like freedom, equality surrounded by contradictions, and the need for a critical approach are necessary. 
<sep> Many events today, such as the AGOA Forum and the visit of the G.W. Bush project, are seen as elements of these controversial geopolitics-economic treatments that have started since the 1989-90-91 period. 
<sep> In the past, it was very communal, very anti-worker, very repressive in the past. 
<sep> For example, on food issues, on a series of problems: centralization of the sugar industry, precarious work; 
<sep> 2 representatives of the Patriotic Front Rodrige have been elected, but their leader Johnson Roussety has been arrested and released on parole for involvement in drug trafficking and influence peddling. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Maybe I should stop here, and we continue the discussion in the future. <sep><sep> Central Bank should control the currency to prevent depreciation and increase in prices! <sep><sep> But the plan to introduce Energy Cane to produce by introducing clones and based on genetic manipulations. <sep><sep> For a long time, Europe produces more sugar beets than it consumes, and then it imports sugar cane from ACP countries; so all its surplus sugar, Europe sells on the world market, at a higher price than the cost of production, thanks to the "illegal" subsidies according to WTO regulations. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, as time passed, Jamouna felt that her husband, always strange, was becoming even stranger. <sep><sep> This is important because it confirms that the demonstration of two great blocks is shaking a little. <sep><sep> We feel it every time we go to the market. <sep><sep> With the Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS), all good agricultural lands are turning into sugar cane plantations, not just to produce sugar but especially to produce cane to get the maximum bagasse for producing energy, molasses for producing ethanol. <sep><sep> Even the children who go to university today, because the system has simply shown them to memorize, they cannot develop enough capacity to think properly. <sep><sep> Everyday life has become an even more difficult struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The army found it as easy as pie, so a jeep with 4 soldiers went into the village and threw tear gas bombs to disperse the youths. <sep><sep> When there was a Sachs Commission, the MSM/MMM coalition influenced the Commission by proposing Amendments corresponding to their electoral arrangement. <sep><sep> When viewed from a certain distance, the citadel's head was hidden in the mist; from the coast to the mountain's peak, there was a trail of powdered silver it was as if the mid-blue sky was reflected in the air; <sep><sep> MFPA and its 300 associations are fighting for women's emancipation through freeing us from our biological role somewhat automatically. <sep><sep> Nobody, definitely not even themselves, knows where these 8 Best Losers will come from, on what basis the final results, nor in what way a leader will proceed with their nomination. <sep><sep> Let's not forget the anti-worker and repressive measures implemented by this government like <sep><sep> Especially where there is social inequality, class inequality, or that fight we call the class struggle. <sep><sep> We know that the State is seeking truth about Kaya's death and continues the policies of Jean Roland Anne-Marie, Haresh Nepaul, and Jeetendranath Ramdin. <sep><sep> When the article appeared Le Mauricien on the 23rd of October, Ashok Subron said he was already in the ILO for his professional and personal activities. <sep><sep> In terms of the Creole language, there was a lot of monumental political change in 2011. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Whether it nationalizes, whether it sells, whether it overreaches in its camps, it prints dollars, while other countries and capitalists are holding on to dollars as reserves. <sep><sep> The Bidze Deplizanpli discourse is becoming like a "Discourse of Thrones," where the Finance Minister announces a certain number of intentions and very vague processes, as if there is no specific allocation, nor any specific timeframe anymore. <sep><sep> Sometimes they dream big dreams, sometimes they explode in anger like a volcano, and often they take steps towards self-destruction. <sep><sep> He tells the Government to give him more than necessary to win the votes. <sep><sep> Because there has been sustained work for 40 years in favor of the Kreol language, finally it has borne fruit. <sep><sep> "Let's sleep and then we'll see the situation again." But that may have been one of those turns in history. <sep><sep> Radio and the press have even come to believe that the capitalist system is going "from death to natural death." <sep><sep> AKM, ten euro value, they have completed everything they were supposed to do. <sep><sep> Fifthly, it's the Government that is influencing, or a Political Party that may come to power. <sep><sep> Even if you do this, when you finish declaring your strike, the Prime Minister can file an application with the Supreme Court to say that your strike is threatening the economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Beneath a container, there is content. that the LALIT (a political movement in Mauritius) has distributed today, 9th September (a container). <sep><sep> Revolutionary militants needed to barricade the railways to prevent the army from entering. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, the Chagos Refugee Group (GRC), following its legal strategy, has been increasingly taking independent initiatives since the Mauritian government's stance on the return of Chagos. <sep><sep> As you may know, the British government deposited most Chagossians on the largest island of Mauritius, Port Louis, and a portion on the largest island of Seychelles, Victoria. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin analyzed how LALIT was already conducting a campaign for a new economic policy as Mauritius faced a systemic crisis with the collapse of the sugar industry, which had been the country's economic foundation. <sep><sep> At the same time, we organized a literary competition in Creole. <sep><sep> Therefore, we find ways to transform the sugar industry affecting different social classes in very different ways and they will react based on class interests. <sep><sep> to massive development of renewable energy, such as "clean" and "truly renewable" energy like solar energy, wind energy, and ocean energy (tidal and wave energy). <sep><sep> Then we'd march, to Zarden, Zarden Company - literally a small area - then we'd go out into the zone, facing the sea. <sep><sep> - Finally, you know that I'm just trying to legally fight for what I've been doing for a while now. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is the work that we have in front of us. <sep><sep> LALIT organized it, because Lalit de Klas had political leadership in this degrowth movement. <sep><sep> When they are selling their products they do it in different ways that vary from morally honorable (if we assume they don't have control over the content of foreign advertisements). <sep><sep> Meanwhile, a Parliamentary Committee has started an inquiry in Great Britain on illegal imprisonment and torture by America on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> In other words, if a woman suffers sexual aggression, she won't have to face the patriarchal environment anymore. <sep><sep> Or ask LALIT members to get in touch with Fim Klib. <sep><sep> The entire trade union movement today is in a bureaucratic clique, which has developed a distinct interest from the workers they are supposed to represent. <sep><sep> Especially in all the Municipalities there is opposition, except in Bobasin-Rozil. <sep><sep> This editor also brings up other issues: children learn by rote, struggle with literacy, lack creativity, suffer from cultural dislocation. <sep><sep> This way multinationals can sell their products in Mauritius. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite his boss's anger caused by the workers, as we know. <sep><sep> Should St. Felix stop ruling, he will not come back, even if you are sitting on the Board, at the Board he has a logic for him, an interior logic of capitalist logic. <sep><sep> In the world, there are many progress being made on the use of renewable energy. <sep><sep> Young people, workers, people who want change have taken action, have convinced people of the importance of political action, and have taken steps to bring about the victory of Obama. <sep><sep> It is because of a government with a capitalist policy, a neo-liberal policy, like this current government, it votes for those 2 laws that favor capitalists, 2 laws that are unfavorable to employers, because its economic policy is for that. <sep><sep> and not through state violence nor through guerrilla warfare, you take power and then believe that this is socialism. <sep><sep> So, we found that the impact of the NHRC on police brutality was mitigated. <sep><sep> The Second International specifically regrouped trade unions and political parties and among its founders were Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg. <sep><sep> When we talk about "socialist", we are not talking about the same thing as Paul Berenger. <sep><sep> to all workers, women, men, young and old who have participated in the LPT literacy classes, as students or teachers, and who continue to animate the classes. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Another contribution of Althusser is the individual as the carrier of ideological content. <sep> After Cancun was a failure, this is creating a space that needs to be maintained: <sep> In other words, it is a bit like a front zone at the beginning, the first 2-3 lanes. <sep> - Are you doing a transfer? Hold your tension! - No your Majesty. <sep> However, I persisted, and Ziz Seetulsingh was still angry. <sep> Issues of marriage, contraception, abortion, domestic violence, working conditions in Israeli lanes (like the Front Zone) and as domestic workers in colonies. <sep> And after that, Navin Ramgoolam solicited Carcassonne and 2 legislators, made an empty promise, produced a report before the end of 2011, without consulting anyone. <sep> The bourgeois section of the title-thugs were furious with Xavier Duval, M.Allet, and E.Francois. <sep> In Parc St Antoine, they have a very special way of celebrating the souls. <sep> But every year before that, we celebrated it, "we were wizards on the defensive," Alain Ah-Vee, who was presiding over the event, said. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There must be a limit, not just any limit, not just any limit together, but a limit in our heads, a limit on which the program in our heads, in what way, at what moment to be able to make progress, to bring this claim a little closer. <sep><sep> But, Mr. Robin Mardemootoo, representing the interests of the Chagossians, says that it is now that everything will start because the problem is only technical, it is not on the surface (according to Week End 6 October 2002). <sep><sep> The government's decision to introduce Creole in schools could create conditions for a greater interest in general language. <sep><sep> 3 trade union confederations have not been able to agree symbolically to rally workers on the same platform for Labor Day. <sep><sep> This campaign has mobilized people in villages and has forced Workers to reinstate Village Elections in their program. <sep><sep> This role, in turn, has tempered its class consciousness, as a worker, during a certain period. <sep><sep> What I can say is, there is something happening on Monday. <sep><sep> What will be an advantage not only for children having difficulties in school, but for all children. <sep><sep> Firstly, a fundamental weakness in the Andior-Discussion Action Plan is that it does not start with agro-industry before development. <sep><sep> In 2006, he left the MMM and joined the PMSD until 2009, where he left the PMSD and formed MMSD. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people were already calling it Tantinn Timi. <sep><sep> Then it's social rights, until there's no difference between social democracy and social rights. <sep><sep> I was giving that as an example. <sep><sep> In this program, our Lindsey Collen member explained that with this legal defeat, the lesson to be drawn is that we need to address the issue of "right of return for Chagossians", the issue of "decolonization". <sep><sep> In the way we learn through languages we don't yet know, that is in a progressive way of removing reflection from our system. <sep><sep> They note that our society is going through a crisis, a very serious social crisis, which is part of this systemic crisis. <sep><sep> They believe that we need more "moderation" in democracy, that there should not be "excessive democracy" like what happened to be in the years 1965-75. <sep><sep> According to the boss' version, they fought "among themselves", but we ask our question: Is it true? <sep><sep> Meaning, it's based on the Check Off system, then it defends the interests of workers on the site. <sep><sep> "My final reflection is that the sugar industry has succeeded remarkably in its transformation, which is continuing, to become a cane industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Is life full of contradictions? Only a very quick political reflex took over the string. <sep><sep> Now PT has 31 deputies, PMSD has 4, MR 2. <sep><sep> Tariq Ramadan, a philosopher since the Enlightenment who is making his 8th visit to Mauritius, and Prof. Juggessur, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mauritius and Chairman of the Mauritius Research Council, were also part of the program. <sep><sep> Together this bloc is contesting the vested interests of the sugar industry, namely mill owners, who make more profits from their mill operations. <sep><sep> Whether it's VRS workers, sugarcane workers, workers in IRS estates or in new cluster estates around 4 factories. <sep><sep> This journey has contributed to a strong government without taking a position on the language issue, and become more favorable to the maternal language. <sep><sep> We found it when Greenpeace took a stand in favor of a "Marine Protected Area" that England started on November 1st, 2010 around the Chagos Archipelago and next to that marine park there is an American military nuclear base on Diego Garcia that the US illegally occupies. <sep><sep> And there are many people who revolt, maybe they don't have the same political ideologies, maybe they revolt because they can't repay their debt. <sep><sep> Prisoners and detainees can also resist if they give someone else a proxy to resist their detention. <sep><sep> It has become even more contradictory when he becomes a witness to the police after the case of Ram Seegobin. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The LPT is organizing the "Hearing" which will take place in October. <sep> Together with another faction of a political party, they are inviting people to this Workers' Day celebration. <sep> Normally, this implies a bourgeois section that is stronger (generally) and that then allies itself with different goals from other social classes but often in the same production line. <sep> However, they are creating jobs for 500 policemen, clearly the Minister of Finance is expecting a certain degree of rebellion when the working class and poor are going to face this crisis that we still don't know how long it will last. <sep> Today we are publishing the speech of Alain Ah-Vee, a member of the LALIT leadership, in the LALIT CONGRESS on February 1, 2, and 3: <sep> If a worker is absent one day during the week, he loses half of his attendance bonus. However, workers continuously absent on Monday have been fired. <sep> For over 30 years, the working class has limited its political actions to merely putting three crosses in the general elections, or occasionally participating in the electoral campaign for 3 weeks. <sep> This separates LALIT, which adopts a lalit politics, declaring it against these other parties that follow an electoral policy, meaning they function in relation to elections. <sep> And then it used the same anti-immigrant reflex, making people believe that it pursues its cause because of its community, and they unite people on that communal basis. <sep> In Mauritius, we have already declared a boycott against Jaffa and Caterpillar products. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people depend on producing petroleum, diesel, for home use. <sep><sep> There was a lively debate that deepened the analysis of the reasons why each person raises his hand to speak, in a very rare way, which is surprising. <sep><sep> In our situation, our intervention in the trade union struggle is constantly transforming the trade union struggle into a class struggle. <sep><sep> So it has become imperative to start thinking about a transitional program to avoid a real economic and social disaster. <sep><sep> We have a program, a strategy we have put together over the last 2 years, we have achieved it, but now, we have to think about how we are going to work together to give ourselves the means. <sep><sep> It has to be that way, because, when there is an agreement, it becomes binding for all the artisans. An employer cannot negotiate with a single union, make an agreement that binds everyone, when they are in another union that is recognized. <sep><sep> Its official launch, LPT will make it in 2009. <sep><sep> It was called the Food Security Fund that the PT-PMSD government launched right after the food crisis and in response to LALIT's campaign on food security. <sep><sep> This is contrary to what the regime's propaganda is trying to make people believe, implying that whoever he may be will not be able to become Prime Minister or President. <sep><sep> Don't say, Ram Seegobin said that Navin Ramgoolam didn't know who was invited, who wasn't. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Participants in Lamars Laliberte have received special training because evidence, preparation is needed when taking action in a place where there are guns. <sep><sep> The first 4 best losers are named based on community basis, while the other 4 are based on restoring balance across the party, without disrupting the community. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the reasons for the leadership positions of the Chagosians' group are growing rapidly within the Chagossians organization at a crucial moment. <sep><sep> Despite tensions during the time, the torchbearer Fanfan Tabardenn did not move from his position, without any serious missteps. <sep><sep> The union leaders have focused on writing a letter to the deputy, a letter to the International Labor Bureau in Geneva, in order to receive hypocritical support from the MMM and MSM, and have organized a symbolic demonstration outside Parliament. <sep><sep> But this Advance Group's bi-weekly set-up is on a path to reinstate this middle-class and upper-class bourgeoisie together, somewhat based on a communal basis. <sep><sep> Although he never had enough surplus to develop his peaceful means. <sep><sep> However, that little poyne, that class, who emerges from his control over all matters, wouldn't be able to exert his power at the time, if he didn't grant it to himself, through the course of history, the means to do so. <sep><sep> More precisely, it will have its State for the time it needs to dismantle the remaining slavery, to expropriate that class which has gradually gained power since 10,000 years ago and which did not exist in the rest of humanity, when there was no social class. <sep><sep> We need to constantly defend our rights, we need to come up with alternatives, propositions on how to have a new economic system, how we need to have a new economic policy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There were technicians who were looking for solutions in science and technology; <sep><sep> He managed to find Jean Carlo who gave him money and helped him save. <sep><sep> On Tuesday evening, they had their match. <sep><sep> It was the first time there had been an infraction in the LPT building since its 28 years of existence. <sep><sep> This way to understand the Palestinian-Israeli conflict allows for a new explanation. <sep><sep> Or maybe, what we are waiting for, when we go out from here, Morisien consciousness maybe, but also that we are a small country with very little land that can be cultivated. <sep><sep> But, what MAAS does not say, but which is directly involved historically, is that it is not causing a 24% depreciation in the value of the rupee. <sep><sep> The problem was beginning to creep into village life. <sep><sep> 1) The boss will be able to reorganize production as much as he wants, which means that a family worker should be able to work on a 12-hour shift. <sep><sep> and the development of agro-industry that will create employment for our future generations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Do not use pesticides and herbicides - they use a mixture of herbs and plants (such as ginger, zinnia, basil, lemongrass, etc.) to repel insects. <sep><sep> It will create a "disorder" between the Labor Party and MSM, in which the Leader of the Opposition is involved, among others. <sep><sep> 100 Dreams since 1976, a track of 10,000 copies each time there is a political event (at least 2 times a year), a book, brochure, program in Creole language. <sep><sep> It is criticizing its boss, causing chaos in its work. <sep><sep> In 1997 another cycle turns in the struggle on the issue of sovereignty and the demand for the military base on Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> It can be a political party representing the interests of a single social class, sometimes a mixture of classes, sometimes a sector of a class. <sep><sep> Only when our children have acquired literacy skills will they be able to use their mother tongue in school, which will then give them the solid foundation to develop proficiency in other languages. <sep><sep> Hence, the MMM believes that a Coalition can promote the interests of the working class much more effectively than the Labor Party alone. <sep><sep> They prefer to say, "I will plant a few crops on the mountain!" It is not surprising that others say, "Instead of growing crops, sow seeds in me, I will go work 10 times a day. <sep><sep> When you have this import substitution policy, you allow a new section in the bourgeoisie to produce soap, toothpaste, toiletries, and thus start a joint venture Mauripharm ruled by Ramdenee, which produces medicines. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And finally, the government of Mauritius, under the Travailliste-MSM (MSM was also involved) alliance, has brought this issue before an international body, under the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). <sep><sep> Do you believe in fairy tales! You even need a document to attend a protest. <sep><sep> How many children in Mauritius realize that when they are singing 'Sur le pont d'Avignon', they are talking about a bridge in a garden located in the south of France? <sep><sep> 1. If you don’t have good linen, there's no use in having a clean bed. <sep><sep> This reminder is very similar to the ones that were circulating in Mauritius when the new GRNO bridge was being constructed and it also shows the prevalence of crossing cultural boundaries. <sep><sep> These NGOs seemed to have been financed, directly and indirectly, by non-financial capital, against financial capital, as well as by certain governments. <sep><sep> Emphasis should be put on direct mobilization - workers, unemployed, and small farmers. <sep><sep> The driver gets out of his truck and explains to the soldiers that he is coming from a checkpoint and needs to pass through to go home. <sep><sep> But the Queen and the British Government have decided to ignore their colonial inheritance. <sep><sep> Understanding the economy, understanding economic reality, and how to manage it are what trigger and influence many sanctions where politics - even if it is evidently political, strategic, it has the ability to amend the evolution of the economy and society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>These two alliances have nothing in their program to combat communalism. <sep><sep>It's a well-calculated love affair, with a very concrete mission to make Paloma dependent on Diego. <sep><sep>Therefore, since the Best Loser system wasn't enough, MSM/MMM is introducing another Constitutional virus that will bring historical destruction. <sep><sep>Many individuals, due to their own ego, abandoning reasons, are not happy and in a minority, prefer to follow the crowd. <sep><sep>And others, like the common platform defended by Yousouf Mohamed. <sep><sep>There are at least 9 things approaching, which, when crossed, will bring irreversible damage to all living beings on our beautiful blue, but fragile, green planet. <sep><sep>He says the Best Loser will be "subsumed", he will enter a party list. <sep><sep>So there was a kind of civil war between Pakistan and Afghanistan. <sep><sep>The dictatorial attitude of Paul Berenger is starting to resemble what the Ptr and PMSD did in the early 70s when they censored the press. <sep><sep>When you start targeting, when you start making people pay for certain services. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Everyone, their spouse like their family, their children like their life, mobilized all their resources and energy to give life a big boost. 
<sep><sep> Since the end of 2008, Sri Lanka has banned all United Nations and humanitarian organizations from accessing the Northern and Eastern regions. 
<sep><sep> Can we revive the economy once again in the current general election? 
<sep><sep> It could have explained what was happening. 
<sep><sep> Now, these three scientists, all university professors in the USA, have generalized the concept of Marx on the "metabolic fracture" that modern capitalism provokes, in a series of "ecological fractures". 
<sep><sep> In terms of the economy, for example, there is a demand for the government to refuse permission to close sugar mills (which the government already has the power to do), and to force establishments to convert their mills into an agro-industry. 
<sep><sep> At the same time, there are structural crises in the sectors of education, health, and energy. 
<sep><sep> In a society where production is organized in such a way that there are different classes of people in relation to production, each class seeks to maximize what it can get out of it, be it the boss, the plantation owner, the worker, or the small merchant. 
<sep><sep> They announce that they are introducing Creole language in schools and parliament, when they have yet to do so. 
<sep><sep> This complexity will arise when a strike is declared, when you are trying to make it a legal strike, you may violate the law and the strike may be broken before it even begins because you are not following the procedure. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Second point, important in what Kamarad Kisna said. <sep><sep> LPT's Horl Mama Bul Later was adorned with palm leaf and paper boat, in the same color as the book cover, that is yellow, blue, and green. <sep><sep> The security industry is collapsing and we have quickly caught up with food crises (even if today it seems under control), energy crisis and water crisis. <sep><sep> Bulbak: In Jabaljas state, you told me you would focus on perfection. <sep><sep> We found in images and with her historical list the Israel-Palestine conflict that Lindsey made. <sep><sep> All the capitalists who have their income in foreign currency: The Security Industry, the French Zone, the Tourist Hotel, are all making record profits. <sep><sep> What's important is to realize that we are not understanding everything in the world for nothing. <sep><sep> He made a proposal, Navin Ramgoolam said his proposal was not good. <sep><sep> Relating to the Chagos Islands issue, following a petition that 904 activists in England sent to the British Prime Minister. <sep><sep> In the textile sector, facing a crisis, we are also finding that exports are heading towards the African market. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that point, there is a direct conflict with the PT nominee at the edge, particularly Sarat Lallah. <sep><sep> And the spectacle was even more gruesome when private corporations and the government took control of the WSF in Nairobi, causing a riot. <sep><sep> This makes it even more true for CNT workers who have to face short-term problems. <sep><sep> In addition, he announces that he is abandoning the management of Le Sentinel and seems to be describing the emergence of a political movement, possibly close to the edge. <sep><sep> Funny! Once I spoke with a couple of important people in the countryside to see what can be done to stop the trafficking, they were hiding from the site. <sep><sep> In the Security Industry, it is quite hot, as it is an old sector. <sep><sep> It resembles a bit like an artistic tableau series (like, yesterday, its title revealed), but their tables have movements in them. <sep><sep> It's good to say that, but we in Lalit, we will remember that during the electoral campaign, these were the backbone of our campaign. <sep><sep> And among these state institutions with established systems, we also have bourgeois lobbying and bourgeois media. <sep><sep> The only difference is that one bourgeois section may have more control than another. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And there are serious consequences for the cognitive development of children. <sep><sep> In NTUC, there are 2 federations, which, in Lalit, we believe are manipulated by political parties, political parties that are currently in power. <sep><sep> But this first challenge by Action Liberale, it is mostly disappearing for several reasons. <sep><sep> The feminist movement is fighting against this specific sexism called "patriarchy", which mainly dominates all women, all children, and most men. <sep><sep> There are strict measures for the police that need to be trained. <sep><sep> - You, over there, jump, talk to me like this? <sep><sep> One of them, surely a police officer, possibly corrupt, probably. <sep><sep> Target a political figure Laborite, either Minister of Labour Shakeel Mohamed. <sep><sep> He believed and made people believe, and many people believed, that this kind of love for the earth that ecology has will prevent the USSR from industrializing quickly, prevent it from becoming equal to America. <sep><sep> This strength, this courage of work, it is useful to him. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, what English his work answers our is that the state is not "neutral", it is not "independent", it has a class interest, it finally endows "impose" a lord established by the ruling class in a class society, rather than "advise" when there is conflict. <sep> <sep> They asked him to sign a paper to present to court. <sep> <sep> He wasn't friendly but rather very hostile. <sep> <sep> After we went up the mountain from Fergison to Kafir Kaddum. <sep> <sep> He said it's true to know specific conditions in Mauritius, for example, and what to pay attention. <sep> <sep> He said what is happening in London as a unity is militarism. <sep> <sep> This means that there are "values" that are being promoted by printed speeches. <sep> <sep> And when I talk about political settlement, I am not only talking about electoral politics, or traditional politics, but particularly class politics. <sep> <sep> And a majority force on the working class to weaken it. <sep> <sep> When they had just married, Timi would accompany him sometimes but when the children started to come Balram

government, for the first time, through the Minister of Education in the National Forum, has made a strong commitment to introduce Mauritian Creole as an optional subject in schools. <sep> <sep> We will notice that in different eras in Mauritius' history. <sep> <sep> Interestingly, there is no legal plan for the 25,000 families that the government recognizes as having no housing. <sep> <sep> They learned to live together as a couple despite more than fifty years of marriage. <sep> <sep> In the financial sector, the employer himself is no longer visible, the worker is not even aware of who

they did not have political rights in the University before. <sep><sep> Secondly, when we have studied what they are saying, the attacks they are making against the leaders in Lalit, it is quite inconceivable. <sep><sep> It seems that it is a continuation of the repression that was going on at the time. <sep><sep> In this context, debates on electoral reform focus more on the leader and the political class than on the ways in which electoral reform can deepen democracy in the electoral process to vote for a government. <sep><sep> Abu C. was given permission to go to his plantation.

trade union bureaucracy. <sep> Health and education are being transformed from essential services in the economic sector where investment is supposed to become profitable. <sep> They are supposed to be “decent”, but their methods are opportunistic and without principles. <sep> This poem by Bertold Brecht, “Workers look at History”, brings out that very clearly. <sep> This image where Nelson Rockefeller shivered with a big smile to destroy an enormous mural by Diego Riviera right here on the forehead. <sep> Minister Boolell has come up with his plan for the restructuring of the sugar

Ramba commented. <sep><sep> Fire in the woods! The pot is boiling! - As the pot was boiling, the hunger disappeared, <sep><sep> MMM, it started well enough but its mistake is that it ended up guarding a unity with straight elements that were put there like obstacles. <sep><sep> a recruitment agency providing work at Diego base (paz 173), which is connected to its private sector (paz 175). <sep><sep> It has brought all kinds of bank certifications to offer feasible pensions for old people and also for all other pensions from the beginning of 2005. <sep><sep> When the Government says that it encourages people to start titles and medium-sized enterprises, even micro-enterprises, it is really encouraging people. <sep><sep> While bad demand is sick, good demand will overcome a broader vision. <sep><sep> Ners ansarz says he was looking for his belongings all night. <sep><sep> Where they have time to reflect if there is fraud, corruption, nepotism. <sep><sep> and to offer seasonal work on a rock higher than what was guaranteed, and to abolish the salary compensation that all workers were receiving in Ziyet to face the increase in cudlavi. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are also "Collective" buses, with different schedules like "Collective 14 December." <sep><sep> We have also launched a campaign against foreign workers, often brought in by unions, as they are demanding better working conditions in Mauritius. <sep><sep> But if we go to the city, we won't get it. <sep><sep> - Why did ECO close down, only to call on a Government Minister to come deposit? <sep><sep> It is not only an error on this issue, but it also shows that the Bloc in Power will continue to laugh at what we stand for. <sep><sep> But, with a crisis in the Eurozone, meaning that Europe is importing less from even BRIC countries, so there is economic slowdown in Lesotho too. <sep><sep> LALIT decided to support Jocelyne Minerve who had resigned from the MMM. <sep><sep> In terms of figures, the plan is to reduce the number of pests to 4. <sep><sep> Everyone is thinking that tears will flow like rivers tomorrow morning. <sep><sep> This widespread crisis that the LALIT Party is predicting and describing in all our tracks and meetings, today it is becoming clearer for everyone. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you declare yourselves 100% Mauritian, are there others who are 70%, others that I do not know how many %? <sep><sep> For the Ministry of Finance to mention the IMF five times in a single budget speech, it must make us all aware that Mauritius needs to have resources for a prosperous future with the IMF's support and that the government still needs to be prudent. <sep><sep> When you step into fiction, reality, there is a problem, a problem for us, because we must maintain the articulation between all three elements. <sep><sep> No permanent military base of another power can have the right to land permanently in a country in a permanent way. <sep><sep> Isn't it the monetary policy of Seychelles that allows the bourgeoisie in hotels, the French Zone and the security industry to make record profits? <sep><sep> The Congress was held on Saturday, the 20th and Sunday, the 21st of November 2004. <sep><sep> We demanded subsidies on ship freight to ensure that prices remained the same in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Is there a new negotiation similar to 1965 being prepared behind our backs in preparations for the AGOA Forum and President Bush's visit? <sep><sep> According to UN figures, mobile workers represent 37% of the total workforce in the world and this trend continues to increase. <sep><sep> However, we were unable to create a special front that could help. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Together with the British and American people, we are determined to close this base. <sep> <sep> Our political program takes us from where we are today and describes a path to a strictly socialist society, to a revolutionary socialism where there is an overthrow of the capitalist system and finally to a situation where social classes can be abolished. <sep> <sep> We have a position on industrial development to preserve and transform agricultural products, such as the Radio Rajni Lallah program. <sep> <sep> In 2004, there was a very strong resistance in Iraq against the American military occupation. <sep> <sep> This crisis is also causing a general rise in prices due to the depreciation of the rupee, in contrast to other countries where prices are falling due to recession. <sep> <sep> Gooljaury and his big brands and his sales process used building with SICOM, brother Timol and Steyt Lenn. <sep> <sep> We can say the same for the White Paper on amendments to the IRA (Industrial Relations Act). <sep> <sep> There was a very interesting debate after the orator's speech where there was a union delegate who agreed with the analysis made by Ram Seegobin and also encouraged other elements to criticize the budget Sithanen especially about the pension size. <sep> <sep> For example, for the list of 30, on which people will be chosen to represent the parties, everyone will have to include the 30 members in the committee. <sep> <sep> To get an idea, Minister Soodhun has just announced that in the last 12 months, 16,000 jobs have been lost. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When he entered the office, he found some documents he did not want to find. <sep> <sep> Today in Larisi, Lalibi, we find all regionalist, communalist, religionist, everything is exploding. <sep> <sep> We have 10 points on which we are leading our campaign. <sep> <sep> What these families have done is completely illegal, they all went to a wedding. <sep> <sep> I find four raised hands: Comrade Yves, Zorz, Anand, Bryan. <sep> <sep> Only after checking if the company is winning the neighboring river, or is poisoning neighbors. <sep> <sep> In 1720 he became the protector of the Lasinn empire, but he managed to keep his social system very strict. <sep> <sep> This paper is based on a speech given by Jean Claude Bibi for the JUSTICE association at the beginning of the month of Ziyet. <sep> <sep> This time, it was a class challenge that managed to mobilize the working class in this challenge. <sep> <sep> It’s worth mentioning that in this new law that the government has just passed, the Employment Relations Act. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was a member of the Bambous Health Project Committee (1979-83) and a member of the Bambous Cooperative until his death. <sep><sep> Today, Sunday 25 June 2006, in the Mother Earth Hall in GRNW, the LALIT party held an International Seminar on strengthening the theoretical basis for our campaign for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> The army and police have not been able to forcibly evict the squatters or arrest them. <sep><sep> In 2000 it was 12% which dropped to 7.3% in 2005. <sep><sep> Today both the tourism sector and the French textile industry, as well as the lottery, can guarantee stable employment and ensure the future for the upcoming generations. <sep><sep> The new industrial law is underway to make the trade unions even more effective and, ultimately, more secure. <sep><sep> I ask myself how did they identify me over the phone! <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen, a member of LALIT, attended a meeting of the African Languages Academy at the University of Cape Town from 5th to 9th December. <sep><sep> Those who manage to reach the HSC level have a much lower number, and naturally those who manage to reach the university level have an even lower number. <sep><sep> So, today when we meet, what is it that we are finding? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Doesn't he have to pay for the hospital, as Konjoo said? <sep><sep> So, we live in a permanent political instability, caused by a serious economic crisis that is hitting Mauritius, and affecting the working class severely. <sep><sep> The BBC announced that 19 people have been found dead, including volunteer activists. <sep><sep> He found himself in a privileged relationship with his fellow worker. <sep><sep> He is an ally who currently plays the United States and Great Britain against each other. <sep><sep> • Keep the electoral system under control to ensure that the elected officials have control over the deputy: 4 deputies per constituency, 3 for Rodrigues and 1 for Chagos (Diego Garcia and Chagos become a new constituency). <sep><sep> Timi had an appointment with the Prime Minister and asked to meet him alone in his office. <sep><sep> Your solidarity among Freedom Fighters and the civilian population with Israeli soldiers in Nablus is highly praised. <sep><sep> The UK offered compensation for Diego and detachment from Diego, as did its allies in missile transactions in several regions of the world, including the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> So for the French zone, in all respects, the workers in this sector have equal pay, the same conditions because they all fall under this award, an award for the French Zone. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then in 2005, when the PT began to develop its program to democratize the economy, which clearly means "don't let them control the economy, they are all", meaning rather a racist thing (which was not new, but has become more marked).

<sep><sep> The press did not bother to ask if there was a link between Jane Valls' move, which accused the WIN movement for general elections, and her husband, who had just set up a political party for the general elections. 
<sep><sep> The Lalit campaign officially launched in the Lalit Congress on 16 January 2005. 
<sep><sep> Now it has 6 ministers, 6 PPS, and President of the Republic, plus many nominations. 
<sep><sep> For example, it is believed that "private property" is a good thing. 
<sep><sep> To address this, you have to find a way to revive the economy. 
<sep><sep> Yesterday, a candidate for prime minister may not be elected in his constituency. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And his average per month this year is around 9000 visits. <sep><sep> But, when MSM became the locomotive in the Government in '83, and '87, in 2 governments of Bleu-Blanc-Rouge, the position of the Labor Party was quite strong. <sep><sep> However, in the last 2-3-4-5 years, there have been some modifications taking place. <sep><sep> And there are also refusals in the case of refuges and immigrants in Palestine, in the West Bank, and in Gaza. <sep><sep> He tells in court that he received a copy of Dr. Ramstein's report on the Internet and he doesn't know who translated the report into French for him (as he doesn't know French). <sep><sep> In less than 7 constituencies, there are results of 2-1, 1-2. <sep><sep> Lalit also became the first party to have as many as 44% female candidates. <sep><sep> Contributions from Dev Virahsawmy, Vinesh Hookoomsing, Philip Baker and other linguists have given rise to an elaborate graph. <sep><sep> Labor is also a party that has represented a bourgeoisie section, which in LALIT, we call a state bourgeoisie, where when it is to choose, it favors a bourgeoisie section, it gives it an advantage. <sep><sep> If we keep an open door for people who have an interest in class issues for peaceful communalism, that is for the bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Very often, in this reality, there are different levels of understanding of what is happening. <sep> <sep> We need to convince workers, as a priority, that we need to abolish what is known as the working class. <sep> <sep> From sector to sector, it varies in the details that are in the contract. <sep> <sep> To return to the issue of Independence, LALIT organized a day of reflection on Diego Garcia, to celebrate Independence in the spirit of reuniting the country. <sep> <sep> A large planter plants sugarcane, then establishes his sugarcane plantation, and when the mill breaks down, they share their concerns. <sep> <sep> In his life, when faced with major decisions, Kamini prefers to trust his intuition, which he considers a form of higher intelligence. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin stated that the MMM deputy Hurnam, given the situation he was in, had to resign on his own and then make a partial statement. <sep> <sep> In the face of these threats, mobilization for an alternative becomes a necessity for every worker and activist. <sep> <sep> However, a bourgeois section (organizing in particular around 2 different publications, L’Express and Advance) takes control of the Workers' Party. <sep> <sep> We need to deepen democracy by eliminating all anti-democratic traps, so that delegates become representatives, meaning in all areas where English and French need to be spoken and written, in civil service jobs, contractual labor should not restrict rights, declaring communities is not necessary. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Toorya Prayag, who was the president of the forum, said that the Front Commun for the Lavortman against these unjust and archaic laws, against turning young girls into free merchants. <sep><sep> 8th Demand:  Provision must be made, we must create a lot of dams that are not too big. <sep><sep> With the money laundering that they do by all kinds of corruption, this police force can keep its team loyal. <sep><sep> But what is interesting in this, is the way the police operate here. <sep><sep> Maybe the friends have noticed that in this National Platform, which sits DWC, which sits physical exams, Lalit, the party in which I belong, we did not participate. <sep><sep> Political parties such as PMSD, MSM, MMM, Parti Travayis, all seek political power to be able to govern the capitalist system in place. <sep><sep> It's a hypocritical movement, and participants were supposed to gather in an Ashram. <sep><sep> But when the majority class (90% of the population that works to live) takes power, it will have its government for a while. <sep><sep> The need for a best loser communal system, he rightly said, gradually disappearing when there is a race census, when it is not forced to declare community, when accustomed and proportional to a certain time. <sep><sep> One democratic state and how could it reunite Palestinian and Israel? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When negotiating with the boss, they discuss increasing salaries. <sep><sep> Places like where the Government should create jobs. <sep><sep> So the State has an extraordinary responsibility to be able to constantly monitor this system, which has been put in place and is unstable. <sep><sep> * Replace the Village Council system, and introduce the Ward Council system in cities. <sep><sep> Their reason for creating a laboratory, a laboratory that can gather a million people (according to the British Medical Association), their manufacturing of dossiers justifying the bombardment of Lalibi, their nerves in front of power. <sep><sep> And when Mr. Sithanen says that growth is "robust," we all know that it is mainly based on tourism, an industry that is not really "robust". <sep><sep> For 3-4 years, LALIT has been signaling that this crisis is not just serious. <sep><sep> On Monday, there was a second ward meeting in Kirpip to discuss alternative economic policies. <sep><sep> We met activists who are working in this rejection movement. <sep><sep> Because it is a matter of strength, of mobilization, of demanding social benefits. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said he will prepare a "Cabinet Paper" to present it to the Cabinet of Ministers. <sep><sep> The third propaganda, the most serious because it insults, and thereby obtains it from the second world war came up, it was when Berenger wanted diversification in 1982, they found the slogan "manyok-patat". <sep><sep> And this deviation has occurred quite quickly, within 4 years, and this deviation has remained, in the licenses until today 2012. <sep><sep> it could be discussed as well, at least if he is incapable because he does not find a clear weapon for other physical reasons, lyseus certainly would have been explained well so that he could actively participate in the Parliament's work. <sep><sep> Lelandime, Sanndia and Yosi decided to inform the Bandouk of their decision to marry. <sep><sep> We have put a systemic crisis in our political work. <sep><sep> So, given the situation in France, we told Penny, "Well, tell us about our France!" So we had an appointment for Tuesday. <sep><sep> when a new sector opens up, for example, the French Zone in 1980, or BPO in 2000, as soon as it opens, you get a number of new workers coming in. <sep><sep> After many banana marriages, they did not have children. <sep><sep> Today, the protesting movements still do not have access to the knowledge of Lenin, to the experiences he passed on to us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We will be able to feel if all these hopes were in vain. <sep><sep> Politicians and a section of the press became complicit in promoting pro-Raddhoa propaganda and glorifying Raddhoa. <sep><sep> - Anyone who is arrested is entitled to legal advice from the beginning. <sep><sep> But they, they control the flow, bar the flow, on whether anyone will declare their community, or whether there will be a question, right? <sep><sep> If MSM destroys itself, then MMM only has two options: to go it alone or to form an alliance with Labour. <sep><sep> The Linguapax Prize represents international recognition for a joint effort of members and sympathizers of LPT to give full dignity and recognition to the two mother tongues most used in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> We have brought Diego to World Social Forum in Mumbai, to No US Base which is a global network to close all military bases, to political movements in Australia. <sep><sep> Here, as we are going towards the introduction of Morisyen Creole in schools as an optional language, LPT believes we should avoid animosity from two opposing directions: <sep><sep> In other words, during 2011, there was not much coordination with our allies in favor of Creole. <sep><sep> In 1982, we will find out what direction MMM takes to "get more". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems that when he was a child, he grew up in Lenoir Jericho on the markers of an Endo-Kreol map and with an Endo-Kreol boy who lived together until he fell pregnant. <sep><sep> Meaning there was no writing, no tablet, no paper, no printer, nothing. <sep><sep> We held a first meeting of the Commission where a member from Beau Bassin attended. <sep><sep> Just like there is a Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Tamil Business Group, etc. <sep><sep> In a manifesto, it is made clear for us, for all women, and for all political parties that exactly what we are aiming for. <sep><sep> The FTU responded, saying "Yes, they are interested," but unfortunately for some reason, I don't know what happened, it has never succeeded. <sep><sep> Since they were formed in 1969-70, from then on, the recognition has been blocked. <sep><sep> Then you realize that the bourgeois state is the backbone of the institution that ensures that one social class keeps all other social classes under its control. <sep><sep> There were some in the past, in the legislature as well, but they did not survive as long as the dictatorial bananas. <sep><sep> International Women's Day is a great opportunity for us to celebrate the struggle of women, and also to take stock of our struggle for emancipation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, we are in a situation where one voice has a duty that comes before the State of Mauritius. <sep><sep> I appreciate what Alain is saying, maybe in our group we don't agree with many things the Group says, but some of them are acting sincerely - when they hear the young people who have participated. <sep><sep> In the meantime, both of them were walking slowly towards the river to wash the old man's clothes on the riverbank. <sep><sep> Every time you go to the cash register, they mark it on that paper goal, today it has been reimbursed as much as possible. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, it's a time to guard and strengthen our international connections. <sep><sep> Minister Kasenally went to visit Diego and when he returned he said there was no problem there and everything was fine there. <sep><sep> Due to popular anger in the West Bank and Gaza rising. <sep><sep> Apparently, the bourgeoisie and the government have conspired to allow a rupee devaluation (so that exporters get more rupees) which has led the people of Mauritius to find an increase in the price of all basic items. <sep><sep> When a level becomes public, are others already negotiating privately? <sep><sep> The third aspect of our program that I would have loved to talk about, is naturally the question of mobilizing within our political program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They say there is a small dependency for them on the property almost attached to the owner's house. <sep><sep> External crisis, yes no control, but we have control over what we decide to produce, how we produce it, we have control. <sep><sep> Then a new system, it's negotiations between the union and the employers. <sep><sep> Development through AGOA and the Multi Fibre Agreement, the future of the French Zone as both employers and producers are threatened. <sep><sep> With meetings and debates on this, inside and outside in the neighborhood meetings, we have prepared a small booklet for the zone. <sep><sep> Prices can go up in the peniri, come down when there is overproduction, but it must be balanced with what is called its "value". <sep><sep> In the same report it notes, "For optimal results, the first language used by children in primary when they are learning a second language. <sep><sep> Following behind the L'Estrac and Gregoire crowd, the workers class plunges into a populist whirlwind behind a pro-capitalist program. <sep><sep> Who will go into which car and what difficulties each car represents and what kind of support expect from the International IWPS. <sep><sep> So, we will campaign on the need to build this opposition outside Parliament, and we will base it on a program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If we take the euro, for example, we will find all the same letter in French, in German along with the European Bank, we will be under the influence of the Euro Zone crisis. <sep><sep> In fact, this strong way to understand Marx did not happen overnight. <sep><sep> Starting from the work of LALIT and JUSTICE, a work that started in 1999, which brought about this progress. <sep><sep> When employers come to work on Monday, they find that there are no workers in the Palmir section. <sep><sep> We have also identified responsibility for this fragmentation, especially where certain leaders are concerned. <sep><sep> This will be a strong commitment for the municipal authorities to tax residents on one side, and to enter into joint ventures with capitalists on the other side, to increase revenue. <sep><sep> During his speech on Radio Plus, on Monday 27th, Minister Sinatambou said that there is not enough representation of the 'kreole' community in the Assembly to defend their interests. <sep><sep> It is also a violence against all the people who are accustomed to these signs and have become accustomed to asking for things at these markets. <sep><sep> Where a thousand words rooted in the mind, the routine cutting-and-sewing Shakti, the eerie without a signal lowers her panties to pour her poison into the Pit of Fools there the same babble 'once in a while in a country'. <sep><sep> Now, everything depends on the same political organization that succeeded in Tunisia before, and this will determine how quickly a new democratic organization can be created among the people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is important to remember that the MSM was already in a "loyal" opposition position, and this "zig-zag" strategy used by the MMM has also made it a loyal opposition. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen, President of the LPT, was taught to say that in the last training course there was an "additional" group of people in the course that did not exist in previous years when the LPT organized the course. <sep><sep> Nowadays a woman doesn't necessarily have to depend on going out to work. <sep><sep> It is not a rushed program, as the Government and Employers and Opposition are proposing. <sep><sep> For this, it's not just Larut Kotyer that has changed course towards St. <sep><sep> What we need to do is to stick to this base once and for all. <sep><sep> In a certain way, it has hindered us slightly, in the sense of internationalism, during this period. <sep><sep> Meaning, workers are bringing a fight - not just workers but everyone exploited - are bringing a conscious fight, as a class, not as different individuals. <sep><sep> For them, they don't know where they stand. <sep><sep> Therefore, the MMM's defeat comes from 1981, it happened again, accentuated even more. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a massive reduction in coastal plains in the sugar industry sector and in the French zone. <sep><sep> If it is Creole that the child speaks, then use Creole. <sep><sep> Afterwards, we will go and show the other women how to do the same. <sep><sep> We find that in this capitalist system, there is what we call a patriarchal system. <sep><sep> But not as a list, but rather the work program as an articulation. <sep><sep> If we look at the election on the 3rd of July just as an opportunity to choose between the 2 alliances that claim to form the next government, it is not surprising that many people are having difficulty choosing. <sep><sep> Their main argument is that violence against women is due to the nature of the conditions from the family, schools, religion that want to control women. <sep><sep> It is you who needs to pay rent, electricity, and telecommunications! <sep><sep> By voting for the white paper, it will mean that we are resisting the politics that the MSM-MMM has brought in these past 3 years. <sep><sep> In the case of Bayaram, Ziz Seetulsing went to visit the cell where Josian was found dead, and at the same time Seetulsing has given permission to the police to not let me (JC Bibi) enter. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are 2 other guests: Sen Ramsamy and Mr. Benymadhoo. <sep>
<sep> Furthermore, there is an argument that Creole is not an actual language. <sep>
<sep> The program includes a history lesson where there have been numerous ideas before. <sep>
<sep> At the same time, he is threatening the Arab Seodit government, saying that they should not use the base too much: they already have a base from which they can attack Baghdad. <sep>
<sep> Olive trees like cashew trees on Bell Village mountain slopes. <sep>
<sep> And he has started implementing it right away, with the first budget speech by Rama Sithanen in Zin 2006, where he announced among other things: <sep>
<sep> LALIT has sometimes participated in it a bit, because capitalism was really pushing its offensive, and sometimes our members had to participate through other associations, because politics was banned!!: <sep>
<sep> In '79/'80 we had very strong ties with leaders and representatives in the transport sector, for example. <sep>
<sep> During PT's time, MMM, MMMSP, and even PMSD, started setting up their own unions and trade federations. <sep>
<sep> Despite the budget speech, LALIT is publishing articles on, 'Analysis of Budget 2011' by Ram Seegobin, which appeared in Le Mauricien on November 12. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is necessary to balance outside so that it cannot avoid pursuit, then it pursues, as Ramlogun has experienced. <sep><sep> And it is this representation of external and internal reality that allows each individual to think, understand, create and be happy. <sep><sep> In the context of the neoliberal economic order where organizations such as the IMF, World Bank and WTO dictate their policies to various states. <sep><sep> There are attacks on workers' livelihoods, attacks on job security; there are threats of destruction by mass unemployment in the sugar and textile industries; <sep><sep> In the sugar industry, it has been observed since the time when the first factories were built in order to allow the cut-loading system to become the cut-stack system, until today when there are machines that cut and load the sugar cane. <sep><sep> This year, LALIT formally protested, and when there were elections, after English and French, the 3rd notice in Schools where voting took place, was in Creole. <sep><sep> This year, thousands of first and second grade children will learn those 2 languages. <sep><sep> But it is very rare that we hear the Prime Minister giving assurances of rights to all citizens. <sep><sep> This corresponds to the UNESCO campaign "Education For All" and in LPT we have always advocated for education as a right. <sep><sep> and health composer such as Marcel Poinen, social worker Alain Muneean, academic Shawkat Toorawa, sculptor Jocelyn Louise. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And there will also be Ram Seeogin who will speak in the same session as Wilbert. <sep><sep> The environmental crisis that exists, is linked with the economic crisis, and needs to be addressed, as there are many ecological damages that cannot be reversed, once they happen. <sep><sep> All the participants went together to the gate that closed the entrance to the village. <sep><sep> The small businessman will also obtain a bourgeoisie that is part of the bourgeoisie but not the same, it is not identical to the wealthy oligarchy, to the big bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> So the WSF is not a structure that has the capacity to give power to mobilize the oppressed classes against this economic crisis in the world. <sep><sep> And even when you look at the Constitution in its Schedule I in the 4 constitutional communities, there are 2 defined by religion. <sep><sep> It shows that the decision on the question of wage, you cannot make that decision through secret ballot, through a secret vote. <sep><sep> Capital can be money, it can be merchandise, it can be machinery, it can be land. <sep><sep> Firstly, we need to see in which direction the MSM-MMM-PMSD is taking the country. <sep><sep> The SILU delegates, the UASI delegates, and other activists were closing shop, the police were closing everyone in. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This parent doesn't know how to swim, he didn't take the good wave on what he does. <sep> <sep> He brought political bedding for political power, and he got it. <sep> <sep> Flour and others, in which he is the Director, and "employing 600 people in Mauritius and 150 in Madagascar". <sep> <sep> In the 'Sustainable Mauritius Island' program, there are different quite positive aspects that we can see. <sep> <sep> This is the same thing he is doing through favoring employers Gamma Civic Ah Teck, Infinity Jean Suzanne, Ralph Loren Rakesh Gooljaury. <sep> <sep> He avoided political work as something necessarily different from union work and social work. <sep> <sep> His second disadvantage is that he lived and fought in Mauritius for only 30 years. <sep> <sep> They find only Berenger's Machiavellian words true. <sep> <sep> With new politics, not giving permits to Palestinian workers, sinking into occupied territories, representing an illegal worker army crossing borders to work in conditions even worse than before. <sep> <sep> He organizes conventions by the Municipality of Port Louis, JUSTICE, and the Nitin Chinien Support Committee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Friend Eddy: I would have been happy to bounce on that one. <sep><sep> In the 70's, we had a conscience prize among many people on this issue. <sep><sep> In the region, and in SADC countries there are markets for agricultural and livestock products, for example oilseeds like soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers. <sep><sep> We must remember that it is the poorest people who suffer the most brutality of police, state violence and torture. <sep><sep> The current government's plan to consolidate our voice is to find it in a global network conference. <sep><sep> Workers' Education (Mauritius) awarded the UNESCO 2004 World Press Freedom Prize. <sep><sep> Furthermore, they have acted with enough constancy of pressure, if you look at it over a year. <sep><sep> * Resist all propaganda by multinational companies and local private sector which are creating GMOs to potentially reduce suffering in the world. <sep><sep> If you have a press conference to call for it, distribute it with a placard, negotiate with you and go home, agreed. <sep><sep> Today, colonists and apartheid oppressors not only control 40% of Palestinian territory, but they are trying to divide Palestinians into 4 parts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Return to LALIT, it is a political tool for us to develop our political analysis, share our analysis and programs so that all our militants understand it. <sep><sep> These documents contradict and come to deny what Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Veerasamy Ringadoo, and Satcam Boolell have said. <sep><sep> But LALIT de classe, which is in Gris-Gris, which is in conflict with small traders and big businessmen. <sep><sep> Do journalists not notice, do they not find this inconsistency? <sep><sep> In LALIT, only we started our campaign on the question of agriculture and agro-industry. We started a campaign for an alternative economy. <sep><sep> Often when there are very fast and well-planned actions, they also take the state by surprise. <sep><sep> You will notice many active members of LALIT at the trade union level, at the environmental organization level, at the women's movement level, in all sorts of different worker and people's organizations who have interests opposed to the capitalist system, which are in conflict with the capitalist system. <sep><sep> When the union leaders were harassed, with an executive not easily convinced -- it took 2-3 meetings, but finally they were convinced. <sep><sep> Jugnauth Snr was more “Bonapartist”, that is to say he ruled over all classes, but acted only in favour of “pure” capital. <sep><sep> The election campaign for the general election has been going on smoothly since before Nomination Day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In short, the Ramgoolam government is colluding with established, with the general boss, and is continuing to give Mauritius land to international millionaires. <sep><sep> So in this flight where you are supposed to decolonize the economy, you're starting to prosper here instead of importing, there you get an extraordinary stimulus for the development of the state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Things that people wanted to have, but they don't have, they transfer it to God. <sep><sep> Later, there was the People's Revolution against capitalism there (1948) and the Cuban Revolution (1967). <sep><sep> But despite the fact that there have been many new things, when you listen to the discourse of the MMM Alliance, we don't really find any differences compared to what the MMM was in the last Parliament. <sep><sep> 5 Months to talk about the importance of democracy and informal freedom and also as well as formal in the world of work. <sep><sep> It will also be interesting to see how PR walks here. <sep><sep> If you ask any CNT worker, you wouldn't believe it would be better than having a single union, they would all say "yes". <sep><sep> It's all about deciding, for example, that the state won't claim 'costs' against Block 104 after they lost their case in the Privy Council. <sep><sep> And this CSR system is becoming very popular among people who serve in social work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> GWF has lost all its para-statik sector - CEB, CWA, Municipality. <sep> They marched with the Workers; with the Workers, more than IFB because IFB often was stable. <sep> When the river began to flow, all rivers flowed. <sep> In their madness, they attacked the police stations in the neighborhoods, and in the absence of a guardian in the countryside, they almost had to attack other State institutions. <sep> Every day he was feeling a little closer to Prathna, the miracle child. <sep> That was an advantage for a part of another family. <sep> You cannot imagine that you can perfect it BEFORE, then you will use it in school. <sep> Classically did like red bricks, when they thought a lot before deciding where to cut the first piece of the blade. <sep> This also reminds us of this strength: barbarism or socialism. <sep> While we are talking about Narat, the army does not enter villages twice. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The fox, a previously militant sect that had become parastatal, tends to follow PRB, like all parastatal groups do. <sep> <sep> So, we are weakened by waves of privatization, or capitalization from foreign sources. <sep> <sep> They used to have a crash pad, and they used to have to eat in the same place where they did their necessities. <sep> <sep> Under the IRA law, the strike was illegal, so we had to prepare for the consequences of licensing. <sep> <sep> 1. Introduction of a smart card system that allows for one-person operated buses, meaning buses without controllers. <sep> <sep> The first remarkable success for 2004, according to Ram Seegobin, was a very fulfilling year. <sep> <sep> So, when MLF entered the fray as fronts such as Solidarite Morisyen Anti-Apartheid, it participated in all events, all protests against this inimical system. <sep> <sep> We have all this internal awareness. <sep> <sep> Confusion on which is the electoral system, on what is "electoral reform". <sep> <sep> Can we revive equality as we did in 95% of our history in prehistory? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It was found easy to keep on working in a way that serves a boss nowadays, at the same time as weakening a feature where the State pays domestic workers working in households that need a hand, for example for medical or social reasons. <sep><sep> The State is destroying a group of people's languages through the destruction of what makes them a "genus" (people who speak Mauritian Creole and Bhojpuri, meaning the majority of the population). <sep><sep> They regroup, the capitalist class, and they have gone to claim their rights. <sep><sep> One of the most known experiences is the organization of the First International, also known as the Workingmen’s International Association (IWA). <sep><sep> But we have to ensure that we are by the workers' side, with the mass of people, it does not depend on bourgeois media. We have to develop our own line directly with the working class, with the different communities dominated by the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Sarkozy says he will decrease immigration by 80,000, especially the families of farmworkers. <sep><sep> Get where the confusion will come. In that commotion, there are trade unions SILU and UASI, one of the members in GWF in CSG, at that time SILU joined the demonstration on 10th March. <sep><sep> A rather particular strike where the strikers even admit that it is 'perfizyon' with glucose and diesel. <sep><sep> So, the letter of protest in that demonstration was addressed to the Interior Ministry Zapone, and when it reached a Zapone soldier at the gate, the content of the letter was read out loud to everyone present at the demonstration. <sep><sep> 1. It aims to defend the workers' rights, to ensure that the bosses respect labor laws, labor contracts, and collective agreements; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Medpoint lays off employees; P. Jugnauth, Hanoomanjee, Jeetah, Beebeejaun - Economic conglomerate sector; <sep><sep> He claims that the only way he can get rich is by giving up a part of the old man's pension. <sep><sep> A dynamic, evolutionary plan that we share together, that we understand in how we make the bridge between today's reality and the possible future. <sep><sep> Never in history have people already made 4 propositions and at the same time feeling that voting is not necessarily for any of them! <sep><sep> And they find that the Government is not proposing anything grand. <sep><sep> He was looking for the way we are "articulating" between different layers. <sep><sep> When Obama, NATO, and the UK have intervened, taking advantage of the situation to overthrow Gaddafi, there is a countermove: weakening the rebellion and Gaddafi retaking certain villages and towns. <sep><sep> It is not clear that anything very interesting is happening during the 25 or 30 years of life. <sep><sep> He asked me to meet Um F., a very active member in the women's organization for the Salfit district. <sep><sep> Some MMM agree, because MMM is trying to take back the city, and this rain will help. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A lecture on "anti-Leninism" in the Frankfurt School presented an argument that it is more "anti-Leninist" than anti-Lenin, suggesting that if Leninism is our priority, then defending the revolution in Russia was the goal. <sep><sep> The government is talking about ICT where they are saying that our "future" is what they did not tell the people that these big companies will invest. <sep><sep> In the context of the celebration of International Mother Language Day for Workers and Immigrants, a press conference was held on Friday, 15th February to launch a call for universal poetry to translate a poem "Little Paper Boat" into 46 languages. <sep><sep> The Berenger-Jugnauth government initiated Cybercity, and Infinity was among the biggest BPO companies employing 650 people. <sep><sep> Today, along with 17 organizations that have up till now piloted a petition organization, we represent the political opposition to this map. <sep><sep> When there was political pressure and a popular uprising in the Philippines, for example, the USA was forced to close one of its most important bases. <sep><sep> You will recall that just before the general election, PMSD-PMXD-MR managed to come together, merging. <sep><sep> If (electoral reform or not) PT and MMM finally come together, either in a coalition or in an early election, they will expect a 60-0, with their hold being strong enough. <sep><sep> During Princess Prathna week, Yosi and their eleven friends held meeting after meeting to sow the seeds of hope. <sep><sep> This comes with a massive licensing when many free trade zones in the French zone have closed, and Bel Ombre mill has closed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I will end by saying that LALIT, rather than representing the political force that embodies the interests of the working class, we, the youth, challenge the historical power bloc. <sep><sep> All this goes to show that the old power bloc has been fundamentally destabilized. <sep><sep> "Today the nation is suffering; I believe that my generation, which has grown up in a political milieu since the age of 13, <sep><sep> Despite a series of reforms that have been made, which have rewritten the history of Mauritius, according to its own standards the system has failed. <sep><sep> Because it understands this, it is trying to help the sector enter unambiguously. <sep><sep> And it has shown that the "Marine Protected Area" is a way for the British to gain the high moral ground to keep its base on Diego. <sep><sep> Workers will realize that if they mobilize, join unions and become active in their unions, if they cease being mere pawns in the hands of a small bureaucratic elite, working conditions will deteriorate as they have in many other countries, and in Mauritius they are beginning to deteriorate. <sep><sep> This way of making decisions that is not democratic under capitalism is a way of saying that it is not easy to stop this new fracture. <sep><sep> But, given that the Finance Ministry is already predicting harder times ahead, there are no measures to support the population. <sep><sep> Moreover, it lacks the vision to take power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And of course, we can adapt our program, understand it well, test it in class, and also mobilize behind it. <sep><sep> So, when we get it, starting with ecology, it's also, it's a starting point that, if it's not on a classroom basis, it risks becoming a patron, really. <sep><sep> For trade union members too, there are 2 ways they look at a political party: one, they find a political party outside of power, and there's another way they look at a political party in power. <sep><sep> We were looking at Talerla: When a worker is working, selling his labor, it's a valuable capacity that he is selling. <sep><sep> And it's the production system that determines the political or social reality. The economy doesn't determine all decisions, obviously, but in the final analysis, the economy does determine. <sep><sep> Even the Church, for historical reasons forming a party in national education, when it was revisiting its 'education project', it found our program positive. <sep><sep> The PML, like all religious laws, attacks fundamental human rights. <sep><sep> Even at the level of the press, which is now pumping air, has started to find the mansion that was being built. <sep><sep> So we assume that it's also "dedicating" the defeat to Pravin Jugnauth. <sep><sep> The sugar industry is finding it, the textile industry is finding it, and all sectors will be affected by the enemy - then I will come back on it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As you can see with such clarity, the situation for the working class is becoming catastrophic. <sep><sep> Thank you very much for your attention and congratulations again to the Playgroup and LPT team for making this possible. <sep><sep> The soldiers smashed the wooden gate and fired live ammunition from behind the wooden wall. <sep><sep> Each of these mills needs 1 million tons of sugarcane per year to operate. <sep><sep> On the day of the last general election, when all the big alliances united, it created 9 parties that participated in the election! <sep><sep> Since the time of Jugdambi and Rima, the same way it has unfolded. <sep><sep> Before we celebrated, Alain invited everyone to a farewell party. <sep><sep> As he has demonstrated with his councils (Ward Council) during the Paris Commune in 1871, the soviets in 1905 and during the Russian Revolution in 1917, the councils in Shanghai and Canton in China in 1928, the Labor and People's Council in 1956. <sep><sep> Because they realized that if the people were more demanding, assessing a clear and coherent political program, it would pose a potential threat to their power. <sep><sep> - Tourism - where he allowed "tourist services" for investment from abroad with the WTO. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is noted that, coincidentally, when Navin Ramgoolam visits officially (more than 2 private hours) in London, SAJ also visits privately there. <sep> <sep> On Saturday, December 6, the new association JUSTICE is holding a conference as part of its work to seek justice in the Kaya murder case at the central police station in 1999. <sep> <sep> It's a form of State that is 'underdeveloped' compared to the State in Europe, where capitalism had already emerged. <sep> <sep> He needs to seek another world, another market to boost his courage, another workforce. <sep> <sep> He's not threatening enough to use it for reading and writing, to use it for abstract matters. <sep> <sep> - Princess? - But yes, borbak! Her father King of the Universe. <sep> <sep> In addition to a program, a political party, it must also have a form, a structure that allows its members to participate in a democratic manner in what is happening. <sep> <sep> But, even before that, it seems elementary, perhaps before we must quickly understand what we understand by a political party. <sep> <sep> It is very mechanical: It will reinvigorate the GWF, take control of the net GWF. <sep> <sep> And global justice triggers only preventive wars simply to assert its presence everywhere and then gradually 'civilizes' those other global players and a Coca-Cola culture, mcdonalds and hollyhood. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today we will have a debate and discussion on how we can better organize our program, the program we have been advocating for, developing over the years. <sep><sep> One speaker appealed to both parties to have the same language towards trade unions when they come to power, while another speaker predicted that the Ramgoolam Government will fall because of these two laws. <sep><sep> This allows the army and the police to control all entries and exits in every village. <sep><sep> Furthermore, there is a ban on exporting goods excluding fruits and certain flowers. <sep><sep> But there should be more facilities to rehabilitate drug victims. <sep><sep> Two conferences on depression, one to discuss the political situation, the development of the Creole language, Chagos, support for the New Family Manifesto, and the other to discuss the political situation and announcements of the State of Emergency on political parties. <sep><sep> This means that apart from Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, as Finance Minister, a 60-year-old person, in order to receive his pension, he must prove that he has an income less than a certain amount. <sep><sep> Therefore, on our level of struggle, it is this fight that workers bring against exploitation by capitalists. <sep><sep> The I.O.Z.P project and the presence of US military bases on Diego Garcia encourage a new dangerous military course in the Indian Ocean region. <sep><sep> And it is at that moment, then, that we will have difficulty in establishing links with the trade union movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (b) The conflict arises from the fact that a French company, Cidec, holds around 25% of the shares and forms a strategic partnership with various IPP establishments that control too much of an essential service such as electricity. <sep><sep> Yesterday, we found after many studies and discussions with linguistic comrades that in order to handle a second or third language at a very high level, it is very difficult for an individual. <sep><sep> And the bureaucracy of the PLO, which does not necessarily find the location as a priority and is developing a contrary interest to what the Palestinian people want. <sep><sep> Events organized by associations or trade unions where the Minister or a deputy is invited to speak, which is represented by the media as a national event. <sep><sep> Like the MSM, when it is not in power, it cannot operate like a real opposition party. <sep><sep> An animal eats plants, metabolizes, becomes energy, heat, meat, fat, skin, skeleton, etc. <sep><sep> During a 60-year analysis, Ram Seegobin provided an analysis of the reasons for the strike and its general context before explaining the unfolding of the strike, not step by step, but through general principles on which the whole strike unfolds. <sep><sep> Young people in the countryside are experiencing stability in the present. <sep><sep> However, this does not mean that Creole should be used as a medium. <sep><sep> Is it conceivable to invest more than 23 billion rupees for the consolidation of production of 5 to 6 million tons of oil?<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now an editorialist (Michaella Seblin, Finlay Salesse, Jean Marc Poché) is beginning to draw attention to the absurdity and hypocrisy of this vampirism from Subron. <sep><sep> If Israel does not agree to put the issue of refugees on the table, how can there be a resolution? <sep><sep> Jugnauth will also benefit from the work of Peter Craig-Chit Jeeseeramsing in America and from the help of the American embassy in Mauritius, Mrs. Penn Korth. <sep><sep> MBC TV and reporter Le Socialiste were also present. <sep><sep> His Bill pretends he is introducing a pension scheme. <sep><sep> The Second International has also erupted, and after the war, it has been reconstructed under a different name, "Socialist International," which has finally managed to bring together bourgeois parties, including the Labour Party of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Now why do Marine Park represent an ecological threat? <sep><sep> Even if they were active in the symbolic about grand political parties such as PT Brazil and Porto Alegre. <sep><sep> We had progress that started in 1982, where there was a unity among extraordinary working classes. <sep><sep> They use religion, association, government, etc. When introducing the Kreol language, Morisian language, and also the Bhojpuri language. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I remember another expression also, they were talking about “patron de progre”. <sep> Among the players that will play; Kolye Sipay, Yer Swar, Zanburzwa, Diego... <sep> Now those who manage to pass, because the passing rate is not giving enough competence to continue a correct schooling, the problem is also that it is an act which the system teaches according to their own standards. <sep> Quickly acknowledge the another dimension of this concept alienation. <sep> At the same time that we have stopped Grup Zenn, we decided to attend a Members Assembly to rethink all of that on the 4th of July. <sep> They allow an evolution and a sensitivity to sounds and languages, what we in English call 'phonological awareness'. <sep> And it clearly makes a big mark finding a greater purpose for them in their 'clusters', namely in electricity production, and ethanol. <sep> * At the signing to Rafat, D., C., H. <sep> He has given the example of licensing by agreement in the Subana lime in early 2013, and this without any warning. <sep> And what is important, political organization, it is something that fits into the field of our own desire. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Different branches in rural areas are participating in the elections in different ways. <sep><sep> While the Lakor Med Point had given SAJ the power to "never dissolve Parliament" if he ever made sure that there was another member of the National Assembly who could command a majority. <sep><sep> There is a real dance that certainly produces and traders hoard, which worsens the situation; <sep><sep> He distributed 160 acres, in a meeting of the Sak Fund. <sep><sep> It is important that the Mauritius government exercise strong military footing on Diego Garcia, not mentioning a location as it did last week. <sep><sep> We should not cry "sold", do not take it into account. <sep><sep> Lalit has been circulating our anti-communalism program since May 2005. <sep><sep> - The State, iconpri Registrar of Associations, should recognize the mother tongue that the vast majority of citizens use in associations; <sep><sep> Either a, b, c, or otherwise, then d. <sep><sep> And this second face, it, ultimately, shows its true face. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are not saying that the law should not have entered, but it, as far as the family is concerned. <sep><sep> You can make a request for an email copy (lalitmail@intnet.mu) Here is a summary of our program: <sep><sep> - I will conclude with the political significance of a light for women's liberation. <sep><sep> IWPS is meeting families and neighborhood committee members in villages to see what kind of action is necessary to resist these demolition orders. <sep><sep> Secondly, he implemented its New Social Consensus, which means MMM considers bourgeois party "Mauritian nationality", normal. <sep><sep> They make people believe that private services are much better. <sep><sep> "The Economist" Thursday 2007, a magazine advocating economic liberalism, explains that sugar producers in Mauritius are receiving subsidies to increase their production for ethanol. <sep><sep> If you do not change you will eat honey, you will drink honey and you will become honey. <sep><sep> For example, today in 2012 in the hare, in a time where there are threats of privatization. <sep><sep> It has described the kingdom as a "beehive", and has located all its condor as a pomegranate, and as a concentrate of Mauritian culture. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That is the “National Resilience Fund”, it doesn't only support the most vulnerable directly; <sep><sep> Jean Claude Bibi, our first speaker invited, talked about "What is a Transitional Program? <sep><sep> And at the same time develops agro-industry - the industrial transformation of agricultural produce. <sep><sep> LALIT has made its position very clear and public on this issue for a long time. <sep><sep> But, when we use my "working class" class, we want to say that everyone is forced to work to survive. <sep><sep> But the situation is that (here called apartheid toilet and it is only reserved for Africans and Israelis, army and police) make the colony control more than 40% of Palestinian land. <sep><sep> Another difficulty is the attitude of the same section of the trade union movement, which finds that foreign workers are taking over jobs. <sep><sep> In fact, since we exist, we have done a lot of work on mobilization based on our program and very often we do not need to go to Parliament to get wins, wins victories based on our program. <sep><sep> When there is an economic crisis, it is more difficult to sustain, because an economic crisis means and leads to a social crisis (there may be more rebellions, for example). <sep><sep> Dulloo's arrival at MMM has shaken other MMM leaders. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He will have to provide all kinds of documents to prove it. <sep><sep> When learning Kreol LPT, a new course "Kreol as a Foreign Language" started in Grand Bay on October 25. <sep><sep> At the same time, we find it important to report what Cyril Monty has said in this radio program. <sep><sep> In this session, he was the third in the series "What is LALIT?" Ram Seegobin animated the first session of the intermediate history series LALIT, while Rajni Lallah conducted the second session in which he compared LALIT with other political parties, especially MMM and Labour as well as other parties. <sep><sep> The second question is to eliminate the Bes Loser System to break these pressures from communal lobbying and to stop categorizing people in communities. <sep><sep> In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez is sick and is suffering from cancer, so the government is mobilizing when there is a flu affecting his health. <sep><sep> So, the report states that the political party that wants to become a "national" party finally, if it thinks it can represent all social classes in the country, perhaps, it will take a stand as a social class that is already dominant to remain dominant. <sep><sep> Employment Rights Bill: News Archives Peace 8, September 11, 2007, also under Documents. <sep><sep> Today as we celebrate "World Literacy Day", the Education for Workers says that the government must stop using a "sub-tractive" approach, which is responsible for the lack we suffer. <sep><sep> and Brazil to even university academics in Sweden, Africa to the South, Namibia, Tanzania, and India including major international intellectuals such as Vandana Shiva. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Is it a coincidence that the international press is covering all the tapaz events taking place in Tibet? <sep> <sep> We have gone through many stages, we have had to work in many ways to make a living. <sep> <sep> to have enough energy to kiss at the same time when the lamas are getting ready to kiss. <sep> <sep> Family was only good to serve tea when there was a political meeting. <sep> <sep> In a constituency, for example, we had Bolom Ramgoolam, Beejadhur against a PTr candidate. <sep> <sep> This work, which the family has the responsibility to do - to analyze and reproduce the strength of each - is becoming more difficult. <sep> <sep> As it is now, it's just planting cane that covers. <sep> <sep> and its logic is not to spend money on anything. <sep> <sep> All children should receive a good education: a cash education / holistic development. <sep> <sep> Then he refused to talk in the MSM Bambous Miting. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Enemy enemy, through the reign of Anerood Jugnauth, through the MMM trajectory, people have come to feel that the name, Deputy for this constituency for our loyalty, Trade Unions for our loyalty, Private Radio for our problems, individually. <sep><sep> And in the presence of Dr. Arnaud Carpooran who leads a team that has just launched the first dictionary Morisyen-Kreol Morisyen. <sep><sep> Firstly, it was a dialogue that was not on the agenda. <sep><sep> It is money, and the ability that individuals have to make money for themselves - not for society, not for you, not for workers, but for themselves - that is important in capitalist society. <sep><sep> One cannot tell the person "You are working here, but in one arrest, go look for another job." You cannot tell them "Don't do anything, your family won't get to eat." So, today, the Government is proposing a special form of unemployment benefit. <sep><sep> It seems that the American government is trying to get a settlement in the matter of damages in the American court, for which those responsible for the forced displacement suffered by the Chagossians, is not it, it is Great Britain! <sep><sep> LALIT would like to greet the mobilization work that all unions in the Mauritius Telecom sector undertook to oppose the privatization process, including especially the Telecommunication Workers' Union. <sep><sep> Other youth are trying to earn through working on cruise ships or migrating to another country. <sep><sep> All these demands are questioning the dominant system, the capitalist system, the bourgeois system in different ways, ultimately. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, what is the position of the MMM and MSM opposition on this? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People had to board the boat to cross the sea to the other side. <sep>

<sep> The Electoral Commissioner has an absolute constitutional obligation to move forward with all preparations for the Partial: he does not have the right to follow what the leader of the MMM proposes to do, even if this results in the abuse of the Prime Minister. <sep>

<sep> He has turned the family bed into a political Bed, and has exposed bankal demands and claims. <sep>

<sep> We support the solidarity demonstration organized by the union on Saturday, March 6, 2004, in front of the MBC. <sep>

<sep> So, in 2 months the Academy has made enough progress for the Creole language. <sep>

<sep> What Sithanen is doing, he is making it happen. <sep>

<sep> The Union has this limitation because it must follow capitalist logic. <sep>

<sep> to come into a position of invitation support for a political party that is in favor of the bourgeoisie section that is called the bourgeois state (mountain capitalist). <sep>

<sep> In general, the trade union movement is not able to endure the crisis that exists in the country. <sep>

<sep> Finally, Moulou Gujadhur has drawn attention to it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is the same reason why the Mauritian government has never provoked a debate on the Chagos issue in the United Nations General Assembly. <sep> <sep> But, this Constitution itself, the rights that guarantee our ability to do so, also, has another place where it stipulates how we can consolidate these rights with ours. <sep> <sep> However, then Berenger becomes opposition leader after the MSM lost 2 MPs, which went against the MMM. <sep> <sep> Nevertheless, the biggest task we have accomplished is providing assistance to start the "branches", meaning the branches of SILU-UASI conventions. <sep> <sep> Classes that already have associations, cooperatives, village councils, unions, are the ones that know how to govern. <sep> <sep> If you have a relationship with all social classes, for instance, if you allow dominant classes to remain dominant. <sep> <sep> In the government and amongst bourgeois economists, no one seems to notice that when Mauritius exports are low when there is a high growth rate, which is negative internationally, and the Mauritian economy is always in difficulty when there is high growth in the world, causing inflation and shortages in Mauritius. <sep> <sep> However, specifically for the OAU, an important matter 40 years ago, it was decided upon. <sep> <sep> When LALIT submitted candidates for the general elections in 1983, 1987, 2000, and 2005, we have had to resort to drawing lots to create a "community" for each candidate to put on their Nomination Paper. <sep> <sep> But it is true that this unrest by the opposition predates CT Power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you go to the beach, it will take about an hour. <sep><sep> The Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees also said that according to their data which was used on May 10, it was CS TEAR GAS but the doses were stronger. <sep><sep> All school books that children have to use. <sep><sep> but it is also following the destabilization that the West, the French military and NATO, have carried out against the regime, unfortunately, Khadafi in Libya. <sep><sep> But I must say that they did not have enough political will to achieve a true reform on the issue of the entire education system. <sep><sep> They have also proposed to pay for all my university studies; they never had time to send gifts for me. <sep><sep> Many people can become rich, but many people are not very talented. <sep><sep> Exactly as Marx predicted, what all bourgeois economists were hiding, they lower your profits in one place, they no longer have a place to invest there, then they have to look elsewhere. <sep><sep> For some time now there have also been Israeli sniper shots against fishers, seamstresses, and Palestinian peasants near the Israeli border. <sep><sep> We found a small wave that the storm has raised that is going in one direction, the short wave that the storm has raised a week ago is going in another direction. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The crisis reveals the limitations of the national health system. <sep><sep> This is not just a State failure as Amnesty claims, it is also a failure of the State itself. <sep><sep> It has also undermined all progressive measures from its party program such as land reform and nationalisation. <sep><sep> 4. Union solidarity can also help foster political and revolutionary militants. <sep><sep> It also suffered profound pain when a woman was forced to continue a pregnancy that she did not wish to continue. <sep><sep> This state of affairs is necessary for us to be able to develop long-term environmental policies, beyond the mandates of different Governments. <sep><sep> I am sure that comrades in education will agree that today there is repression against those who are more beautiful, brighter in a person. <sep><sep> We have developed our capacity to grow, local and international political influence. <sep><sep> They have no proposals to change the system, they themselves represent the system. <sep><sep> Here, for example, this is how I start my morning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Afterwards, he had two daughters who were followed by two sons. <sep> This call for the decriminalization of abortion, it is a call for greater class equality. <sep> Does the government have the intention to act against people, with reason, to provoke anger? <sep> We will explain the importance of the two members of Lalit who work politically in the Land Oversight section for the past year. <sep> Many people ask us, "But why are no Lalit members in the meeting being held in Beau Bassin?" Beau Bassin, where their federation, FTU, is going. <sep> Let us remember that the government compensated us but it also took commitments that it would give us another job or another means to feed our families. <sep> Moreover, in 1971, a great movement arose in the establishment there, the Anna establishment. <sep> Prime Minister Ramgoolam, as he claims he intends to do, must specifically convene a meeting in front of the Commission to trigger the inspection procedures on Diego. <sep> A short time after the regime change, courtesans, courtiers, commissioners, carpenters, wheelwrights, sellers, saleswomen, and merchants who were in the majority, filled with pomp. <sep> This is how workers began to receive many benefits in the form of financial security, welfare benefits, and pensions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After 47 years of independence, there is instability on the Diego issue which was provoked by: <sep><sep> Political power, political work, it's when we use our power of mind and our voice, power of our natural language, our mother tongue. <sep><sep> In this book, Lindsey said, Marx's Ecology by John Bellamy Foster, Ellora Devononcourt had sent it from America for LALIT. <sep><sep> The situation in which this program is launched is when Mauritius is in a great economic crisis, when the textile industry and the sugar industry have no future with the Multi-Fiber Agreement and the new trade system under the Lome Convention, which is bringing an increase in prices. <sep><sep> And often this kind of campaign is against immigrants, against non-Christians. <sep><sep> All this finally depends more and more on the strength of the trade union movement. <sep><sep> What importance is it to understand the responsibility of the UK as a former colonial power in the Partition in 1948? <sep><sep> There are former MMM members, a large number, there are former Labour Party members. <sep><sep> It may be good, but you have to know, when you are going to raise it, when you are going to explain it, you must know when you can mobilize people around it. <sep><sep> In Biddya Peace Center, there was a nice event organized by a women's rights society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bois de Rose protected area targeted; Navin Bodha - Economic sector of concern; Illegal logging <sep> Linite is not just a leader pausing to sit on the same fence. <sep> During the French Revolution, many bishops, priests, etc., were eliminated by the revolutionaries and ended up expropriating all their belongings, their lands. <sep> Another example is when they make us believe that "democracy" is just our right to vote once every 5 years, even if they apply their boss's program after election, but it is not "democracy". <sep> It overturns the tendency for peace talks to fall, as the bosses say there are "100 ways you are destroying their island". <sep> Thirdly, there is a shift in food production globally, where agricultural land is being used more for plantations rather than going towards bio-carbide, such as ethanol production in support of food security for the people globally. <sep> This is an entirely hostile ocean touristic, it pushes you towards a Stalinesque empire, an empire of bureaucrat. <sep> In this signage, all members of the PLO get to vote. <sep> Minister of Finance Berenger has increased VAT by 50% and has also extended this regressive tax on services. <sep> On the rights on Diego Garcia, on NO BASES and on the rights on bases in general. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the growth and expansion of urbanization and increasing work, the right to electricity (and other social infrastructure such as water, telephone, transportation) needs to be guaranteed. <sep><sep> LALIT has managed to further develop its militant work. <sep><sep> Since childhood, Ganga was different from all the other girls. <sep><sep> 4. When the spelling of Mauritian Creole is finally accepted by AKM and by the government, then an argument against the Creole language disappears, or rather it is rather a pretext as if there was no legitimate way to write Creole, it disappears. <sep><sep> And it was not just in USSR that this happened. <sep><sep> It has become evident that the elites and the Government must come forward with a constitutional amendment to ensure the institutionalization of communalism in the Constitution. <sep><sep> For many reasons, in the working class there are several organizations that have different roles. <sep><sep> It was voted in 1973, by a Coalition government: Labor, PMSD, CAM. <sep><sep> Our relationship with the trade union movement and with trade unions is always a "working arrangement with conflicts." <sep><sep> A long process that has come to its end and is now based on communal: the name of the Chairman of CEB, Balraj Narroo, who is at the head of a communal-religious society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The seafood hub processes fish, imports fish from Korea, Japan, processes, and reexports. <sep><sep> We also request recognition of our mother tongue, it is important. <sep><sep> This struggle is the working class leading the way, with interests and the ability to bring this struggle itself, because it conflicts, ultimately, with the capitalist class. <sep><sep> This demonstration blocks the highway, its goal is to show Israeli drivers that this is a checkpoint. <sep><sep> The LPT (Labor Party) says that non-violence and harmony are more important than words, respecting the culture of a women and using the language of a women. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen then explains an important point of analysis, which has been generated by the Literature Education Commission before explaining our proposal. <sep><sep> We did this in a deeply Marxist way, meaning in a context where the mind has lost control over a capitalistic system that is destructive and whose only motivation is profit. <sep><sep> It is not difficult to understand, Comrade Kreepalloo made an appeal to explain in simple language. <sep><sep> What we are proposing is to use a reduced competition for social control to bring a dynamism that will eventually eliminate this competition itself. <sep><sep> Now, we will not just wait to be defensive, we will go on the counter-attack. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Balram thought that he turned out the way he did because he didn't receive enough maternal love. <sep> <sep> The political forces that believe they can manipulate reality with ease are clearly exposing themselves today in all their weakness. <sep> <sep> Then a new form of internationalism begins to emerge, rather apolitical and even anti-political - the World Social Forum. <sep> <sep> This revolution has shaken all capitalists, all bosses, worldwide, including capitalist companies, along with their governments. <sep> <sep> What's useful for us to do is to look at the history of LALIT so that we can understand exactly what LALIT has done to survive all this time and continue to play a role in national and international politics. <sep> <sep> This means you don't have to get into the water, that boat can take you Northward without you having to get into the water, something like a Container. <sep> <sep> It also expresses its love for the Creole language and its appreciation for Alain Ah-Vee, and its voice! <sep> <sep> Lalit is also demanding changes in labor laws so that all workers can benefit from an extra week of paid vacation in addition to their sick and local leave. <sep> <sep> Third film by David Constantin, which will be released on Tuesday. <sep> <sep> And in every country, Marx explained, there is its state. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And then when there is a sole revolutionary, conscious, perhaps international, worker class against capitalist class, as a tsunami. <sep><sep> In all these points, there is something in common; politics, action in common and consciousness to transform society and the world. <sep><sep> In the Chinese state, there has never been this kind of revolt on a class basis. <sep><sep> Now, there is a more organized protest, especially in JUSTICE, setting a series of specific demands. <sep><sep> So there is a variation between the bourgeois state in different countries. <sep><sep> Work on contracts that eliminate job security for a salary that is not even sufficient to meet the needs of a minimum. <sep><sep> At the same time, the government is continuing to expand and secure barriers in the Security Industry at a time when this sector is in crisis with the economy ensuring fair wages and prices. <sep><sep> It is part of monitoring - the first check if the army is still there. If they are there, go where the army is. <sep><sep> To all the members and sympathizers of LPT who have kept our collective memory alive in our own written archives, and are continuing to do so. <sep><sep> Understanding in common We program political action, as a party, it is an understanding of all this political work that we have to do to achieve our goal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At least he made a public apology, I don't know who he is. <sep><sep> And he has implemented a remarkable program in this context. <sep><sep> But what we need to understand is that in the history of movements, so much toil has been found. <sep><sep> It is interesting because it shows how there are those who are still in what I have described as the actions of the vultures. <sep><sep> We need to understand that it is not necessary for us to have too much faith in the law, nor too much respect for the law, because we are respecting something that can detract from our own interests, and it is there for that. <sep><sep> Ram himself has had more difficult votes in No. <sep><sep> or the absence of irrigation water in Rodrigues, and certain lands of Mauritius; <sep><sep> You know how many people come to me, tell me to do this, and sometimes people, like Air Mauritius and companies that deal with tourism, ask how to start a protest. <sep><sep> It will make profits, and I will give him a small salary, profits will have such value, I will make a profit." So, for the capitalist, the worker is useful. <sep><sep> Bureaucracy, if it wants, it puts you outside, or it laughs at you inside, where you are useless in the world of socialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We request Minister Soodhoun to submit a copy of the 3 motions to his Deputy Prime Minister to refresh his memory as he seems to have forgotten his past. <sep> <sep> This indirect tax, especially VAT, is becoming heavier and more miserable. <sep> <sep> If he attacks me directly, he may not even have a chance. <sep> <sep> So I think that there must be a flaw in his system too! <sep> <sep> He makes a comparison with the other German writer, Gunter Grass, who has touched on the problematic issues of describing the lives of 'little people', workers or peasants. <sep> <sep> Because mobilization is taking place in the occupied territories in Gaza. <sep> <sep> Studies have shown how young people are engaging in the forefront of the revolution in Cuba. <sep> <sep> And others have come to realize that they have no other way to change the balance of political forces in their favor: so they may explain their support for a communal movement that may control the bourgeoisie. <sep> <sep> There is a corruption that makes political parties, instead of being a useful tool, become a tool that contributes to the economic and social problems that we are facing, they have become an integral part of the problem. <sep> <sep> Russia was seen as having a progressive role and is supporting countries that are bringing light to the struggle for independence against imperialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It means that N.Ramgoolam is guarding the door to ensure commercial exchange sovereignty with the governments of Gordon Brown and Bush. <sep><sep> He contrasted with the way Paul Berenger was "recalling the 1971 riots" in a more nostalgic manner, saying that they are no longer like that in the MMM. <sep><sep> * When inside this mess and with all his life and animations, the costumes of this ancient civilization that existed, one could almost immerse themselves in Palestinian occupation. <sep><sep> This means that if the union does not have an organization that is run by employers in the interests of employers (everyone knows that there are such parties in the world, in English, it is called "sweetheart" unions). <sep><sep> and the Leal, Rochecouste, Forget families, have become a 100% pro-capitalist newspaper in the Forget-L'Estrac gang. <sep><sep> The Militant, just before the general election, published a total rejection of LALIT. <sep><sep> The 1979 General Strike, for example, this great degrowth movement was against the IRA. <sep><sep> The Local Government Bill is cracking down on centralizing power in the hands of corrupt political parties financed by capitalists and seeking full control over all regional bodies. <sep><sep> These three sizes themselves, each can take a little time, if they take you one by one. <sep><sep> Almost everyone returns to the security industry, it's in euros, 75% of tourism comes from Europe, 70% of exporting companies and 65% of ICT/BPO companies make their income from Europe. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Emily had a sequence where there was a series of pictures projected on a screen, a personal and professional history of Ernest Wiehe. <sep><sep> I remember George Soros, a big capitalist, saying that the "resolution" of this crisis was a crisis of cowardice. <sep><sep> The importance of a vote for LALIT: it's the only way to make a useful vote. <sep><sep> Ultimately, no one is working and they need to go look for goals to fight over. <sep><sep> In conclusion, many protagonists still have a mindset that corresponds with IARA, but there is a new situation in ERA where we need to be very careful: <sep><sep> Where should we put all those people? The day of the party, the invited friends were arriving, the house and courtyard were growing, and finally in front of their eyes there was a big tent. <sep><sep> Regarding FPU, there will be 3 or 4 federations that will come out in one FPU Federation. <sep><sep> But, the press that is supposed to be democratic, independent, and free must forgive this deadline. <sep><sep> We know that the commissioner banned the anti-Bush demonstration and sent a copy of his ban letter to the US Embassy. <sep><sep> * The law as a right; LALIT was at the forefront of the Housing Movement that has had to file housing claims and repayments. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are people like Ti-Frer, Serge Lebrasse, Kaya, Fanfan, Micheline Virahsawmy, Bam Cuttayen, Jean-Claude Gaspard, Menwar, Rajni Lallah, Tive Masson, Rama Poonoosamy, Kenneth Nelson, Rosemay Nelson, Marousia Bouvary, Nelzire Ventre, Roger Clency and Marie-Josee, Alain Ramanissum, Linzi Bacbotte, Bruno Raya, Cassiya, Sandra Mayotte, Gerard Louise, Richard Beaugendre, Claudio Veeraragoo, Claudio Cassimaly, Sylvio Louise, Alain Muneean, Odille Chevraux, Mario Armel, Nancy Derougere, Cyril Labonne, Ram Joganah, Nitish Joganah, Michel Legris, Rosange Andre, Roger Augustin, Eric Triton, Marie-Josee Couronne, Fami Cassambo, Alain Permal, Cyril Ramdoo, Claude Lafoudre, Zul Ramiah, Marclaine Antoine, Laval Veerasamy, Mario Justin, Marcelino Chaton, and many others. <sep><sep> This operation is equivalent to a depression relief operation. <sep><sep> We will keep in touch by phone to monitor the situation. <sep><sep> For the class director to reign, he must share his section with other classes. <sep><sep> This is because the security industry comes before any other industry. <sep><sep> However, those who are replacing you are not necessarily too good. <sep><sep> After Rada Kistnasamy has submitted her paper on current political situations. <sep><sep> That is to say it is not a challenge to the relationship workers have to maintain with the capitalist, nor to the relationship with machines, money. <sep><sep> In 6 subscriptions, we are nominating 3 candidates, in 3 regions of the countryside, and 3 towns. <sep><sep> Jigsaw: There are so many possible options, I'm having difficulty choosing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It has been pointed out that this law has not been updated since 1838: it is very old. <sep><sep> As such, it makes it archaic, even if most taxpayers would prefer to use it. <sep><sep> This allows for an exploitation system that exploits 80% of the population, and a system where every 5 years they go to vote to say they agree. <sep><sep> Today it is becoming a reference in Chagos issue. <sep><sep> This award is a form of recognition of the contribution of women in LPT. <sep><sep> Now he is starting a war with England (on the issue of Marine Park), so he is becoming a Sarkozy man, but, is the government pretending to be looking towards the East? <sep><sep> However, this surname punishment is not surprising for us, as when you look at the first Blue-White-Red Alliance in 1983 and 1987, in the history of independent Mauritius. <sep><sep> He said that this could be due to the fact that the State, under the last MMM-MSM government, managed to set up a committee that led to the Grafi Larmoni scandal. <sep><sep> The date has passed, it is still being used, but we should be looking for a new political form to face this monopolist. <sep><sep> Especially where you go, you are controlled by the Israeli occupation forces. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Coral Book will coordinate various activities and organize the team from the UK and Germany. <sep><sep> Nandini Bhautoo, Nandini Bhautoo was the first speaker, her intervention was based on critical observations that she had made. <sep><sep> So, the report on the clash between the employer and the union in 1973 allowed for the 2 repressive laws at the time, because there was brutal repression against the union (it even went as far as derecognizing, de-registration of the union). <sep><sep> Even though it is a class struggle, it is very rare that the class is clear, and the class as a whole. <sep><sep> Berenger waited 5 days, then he said he lost because of the L'Alliance Sociale communal campaign. <sep><sep> L'Alliance Sociale won 3-0 in nine constituencies, namely numbers 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18. <sep><sep> In a statement on Top FM, Ram Seegobin condemned the presence of 2 American naval vessels HSV Swift (HSV-2) and USS Nicholas in the Port Louis Lagoon. <sep><sep> Zidisyer sent a clear message to the Cabinet of Ministers. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee explained that the debate on education concerns society in general. <sep><sep> The political mobilization of the Nu class finds itself a working class that has interests, the necessary capacity and the necessary willingness to challenge the capitalist system successfully because the capitalist system depends on the exploitation of the workforce of the worker to rule it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And, it is a skeleton that concerns one's dedication towards LALIT, towards Ram Seegobin, towards Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> Before coming to Palestine, I was not aware of all this. <sep><sep> Knowledge, it is sharpened, it is also shared when the maternal language is used. <sep><sep> in all villages and towns, which brings together the National Women’s Council, mobilized to support this Bill for legalizing abortion. <sep><sep> The bird flew away, perched on the grass behind it. <sep><sep> There were speeches that were completely distorted, containing some scattered ideas. <sep><sep> Currently, Jia Zhang Ke is developing a new form for cinematic art. <sep><sep> From 1971 to 1990, they used the pretext of "international law" or sought to change the regional balance using the pretext of the rise of regional powers. <sep><sep> When there is an electoral reform, he hopes they will deal with the issue of the "best loser" system. <sep><sep> There has also been a persistent effort made in the past by all kinds of organizations and individuals. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the third lady came, everyone told her, 'Go, rock her to sleep, rock your misfortune away, lick her mother's little finger.' All this felt like a nightmare that lasted for an eternity. <sep><sep> (For anyone interested, Noam Chomsky has a profound analysis of the role of media in shaping American public opinion, as badly informed as they are. <sep><sep> It seems that the American occupation has other goals in this region than stated. <sep><sep> But, its policies for overcoming the economic crisis are quite different from those of the Lalit. <sep><sep> All these ideas in favor of groups based on "apolitical" and "anti-political" which are "Wanted" are fading away, they are openly in favor of those who exploit and dominate us. <sep><sep> They also find it normal for it to itself divide Mauritius into tiny pieces through language and caste, changing its lines like a clown, but they even denounce Nita Deerpalsing for her opinion on what Bahadoor said. <sep><sep> We don't have a very good record of our programs, but what we have to offer is an idea (this does not include the bribes received when there is a Press Conference or a Lalit communication): <sep><sep> A two-piece Jericho casserole: classic crockery and modern crockery. <sep><sep> He calls it a "state bourgeoisie" because it benefits from the guarantees of bourgeois media through their contracts, privileges. <sep><sep> In 2005, we emphasized the need for a new economic policy, at a time when we needed alternative economic production and consumption. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The law says we can do all that, but in the same book that tells us we have the right to do so, in another place, in the same book, it says that this can stop, these rights. <sep><sep> Let's go to other places while refusing (and here we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people, sometimes even millions). <sep><sep> We have built a mobilization campaign and a program for an alternative economy that aims to: <sep><sep> Initially, it was rejected, but when the authorities and the public were so insistent that eventually his direct boss had to intervene to ask him to provide a service that would please people. <sep><sep> Our participation in this campaign aims to build an extra-parliamentary opposition. <sep><sep> So the boss had an interest in having a strike to stop production so that his warehouse would not overflow. <sep><sep> We are simultaneously fighting for Chagos, we are integrating it into a program that aims to bring a socialist sanction to the country but also a socialist sanction in the world through an internationalist form. <sep><sep> After all these years of social democracy, an alternative, prosperity, lard, what do we find? <sep><sep> This is Berenger's opportunistic policy that will continue to fire. <sep><sep> He did it wrong because when you delete files, they go to the recycle bin. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> To prevent damage and destruction of local culture by cultural export from capitalist countries like the US to countries where artistic and cultural industries are relatively weak. <sep><sep> The forum was chaired by Jean Claude Bibi and also had Lindsey Collen speaking on behalf of LALIT. <sep><sep> More general strikes, more street protests, more standing in silence. <sep><sep> At a more subtle level, there is pressure on individual journalists as well. <sep><sep> The economic question has become dominant, with two key events: the economic crisis in the Euro zone has had an impact on Mauritius. <sep><sep> Throughout the afternoon, he was seated on a stool. <sep><sep> Sandhya and Yosi discussed their project with three Sadou and Banndouk. <sep><sep> Such a program today requires a clear political and economic reorientation, and clearly the PTr/PMSD government does not have this political will. <sep><sep> Why are you so morbid? Are you sick? - 'It's not autobiographical. <sep><sep> All governments in the most democratic countries in the world, have in their legal systems, in their texts of laws, they have all sorts of laws which contradict those laws which give you those normal rights. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Therefore, we face difficulties, problems and even challenges when we step on this kind of land to define people based on 'Mauritianism' as 'Mauritian nationality'.<sep><sep> As you know in Mauritius, 70% of people speak Creole Mauritian mostly, 12% speak Bhojpuri and 11% speak other languages or even one of these two languages, which gives us a percentage of 93% speaking Creole and Bhojpuri.<sep><sep> There has been some support from the MMM for the rights of the Chagossians. <sep><sep> In addition, the Leader of the Opposition, up to now, and the Leader of the MMM for a while, were outside Parliament. <sep><sep> There has even been controversy over a nursery rhyme like 'Yankee Doodle', an American patriotic song that traces its origins back to the war. <sep><sep> But, there are also embassies, particularly the USA and UK, that will have to face a large problem during the current term: to protect their bases in Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> At the same time, systemic crises seek to forcibly change the power dynamics between different sectors of the economy. <sep><sep> Chagos Islands have brought about a fight against the MMM-MSM regime. <sep><sep> This year, the District Councils have always chosen their President in the context of OPA disputes involving bourgeois political parties. <sep><sep> There are academics, university work in the department of linguistics, or in the ancestral African languages, others in a very rich experience in oral tradition, some write and publish for children. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With their trade politics and sales on Chagos and Diego Garcia, traditional political parties and the Mauritian bourgeoisie have been complicit in the logic of American imperialist politics. <sep><sep> Today, we are going back to where we have arrived in this long historical struggle. <sep><sep> In terms of music, in stores, in supermarkets, in weddings, in love, in taverns, in meetings, in reunions, in religious services, in theaters, parties. <sep><sep> When the former MMM-MSM-PMSD Government introduced a new Regional Administration Act in 2003, LALIT was the only political force that mobilized against this new Local Government Act at the time. <sep><sep> * The clear State Section is the "public power" that English describes as a "body" or a "band" of "armed men." <sep><sep> In other words, its course represents a unique inconsistency in history. <sep><sep> Sarat Lallah, chairman of Mauritius Telecom, also faces allegations that he may have bribed a trade unionist, he is now being investigated by the ICAC. <sep><sep> But, in a collective plan, for the punishment of society, does this different struggle not matter? <sep><sep> -Permission and contract between CEB and Gamma-Coventa for electricity production to start soon. <sep><sep> Today, this role has been transferred to an institution that functions as a private company and is selling houses only for profit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This could mean there is an absurd accentuation operation to break the new brit-brit alliance and the creation of a non-constitutional crisis for political leaders who are finding themselves in the heat of summer. <sep><sep> Some are even selling "sexual services" over the phone. <sep><sep> They will only ensure the capitalist class serves the working class all the burden of the crisis, a crisis for which the responsibility lies with the capitalist and the government. <sep><sep> It means that many jobs were created, many businesses flourished during a time when, the end! <sep><sep> It makes sense because children do not manage to use their natural capacity (mother tongue) to grasp, mold, and develop ideas in their service. <sep><sep> We are planning the Uver Congress, maybe, in different regions, this will also be interesting. <sep><sep> We shall reflect on new events, new developments, yesterday's reflections, and integrate it. <sep><sep> However, there was a long period where what dominated the current political scene, there were many talks between MMM and PT, on Electoral Reform and Constitutional Amendment, and MMM is simultaneously doing a Re-Make with MSM. <sep><sep> They went to dirty speeches, and only dirty speeches with no conditions, no big problem within that sector. <sep><sep> LPT representative, Alain AhVee, talked about the work that LPT has done during its 28 years of existence in the field of literacy and the promotion of the mother tongue and encourages family participation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Even with the minority in the workplace, it is difficult for us to enter the minority that maintains the socialist line, but it is important for us to keep the link with our political party.
<sep><sep> Recently we have been facing a series of crises at the international level, which have repercussions for Mauritius.
<sep><sep> Our contestations are still going on in the Court.
<sep><sep> Through the newspaper that LALIT is distributing as part of our campaign, we want to share our reflections and proposals with the electorate throughout the Republic of Mauritius.
<sep><sep> We fulfilled our promise, as populists do, a thousand new jobs!)
<sep><sep> Then we held an International Theoretical Seminar, and after that, we published a book based on the bill (Ram is showing the book).
<sep><sep> The government should change the name and assign "Sugar Authority" to "Optimal Land Utilization Authority", which can provide resources and planning for the massive diversification Lalit is proposing.
<sep><sep> In 1982, it took a decision to no longer have communal classification in censuses.
<sep><sep> All this is to say that we are keeping a close watch to help our campaign as we prepare for the upcoming General Election.
<sep><sep> There is an opposition based on a worker class platform with a vision for socialism. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A foreign company, owned by a well-established businessman (and close friend Maas) has been producing ethanol since last month. <sep> He also mentioned how Europe and the USA have been facing a crisis in agriculture due to government subsidies. <sep> As the reviews keep coming in, the distribution starts to increase as well. <sep> Those who complained were only interested in speculation, manipulation, and greed. <sep> So there were times when what was called the arms race, "cold war," which could have meant serving humanity with a massive amount of destruction developing and accumulating. <sep> Thus we find how the liberated dynamics that make today a time where it becomes possible to move to another phase in the fight against the criminalization of drugs. <sep> How can we develop an economy that is organized democratically? <sep> In the hotel sector, there is a slight increase but not too steep, of about 20-30%. <sep> On Saturday morning, Rada Kistnasamy for Education for Workers and Josian Labonté, a Caritas representative, were invited to the "Peak Time" program on MBC to discuss literacy in Mauritius as part of World Literacy Day on 8 September. <sep> Extraordinary work is being done in Be di Tombo. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Our coordination is already mobilizing people, independently from the government, to confront persistent colonization and illegal military occupation. <sep> But, in LALIT, we have made it a priority to fight on this point, rather than fighting on a thousand little points, because its impact is immense. <sep> It is certainly important for us to address this crisis, as we have just been informed by the Government's census that 71% of people earn less than Rs12,000 per month. <sep> Ultimately, we could not resist, we were forced to leave that goal for another goal calling North One Nordes. <sep> More emphasis on collecting plastic bottles with condensed milk around it along with an empty piece. <sep> to use this product from this diversification, for transformation, for value-added, for preservation. <sep> Rather produce all the food that the country needed and that it could produce. <sep> Then, Gramsci illuminates this dynamic, with another concept, "historical bloc," where a series of classes and sub-classes fuse into a unified ruling and possessing class section, to form a special alliance (which has a political aspect, is also a class regrouping, also an industrial sector interest group regrouping). <sep> It was a central theme in our 2005 electoral campaign, because we knew it was more important for the working class. <sep> Firstly, we will check how many bis companies need to have their transportation arrangements, how many need to be threatened and intimidated by the Legislative Government. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, even in a "downturn", at the same time the international capitalist system is beginning to plunge into an extremely serious crisis. <sep><sep> Today we see companies like Infinity sucking capital that the Government has granted it from the public purse. <sep><sep> Advance (representing big planters, businessmen, professionals) and L’Express (representing urban bourgeoisie and professionals). <sep><sep> We are not supporting any candidate because generally there is a tendency to marginalize all political forces that are not found in these 2 blocks. <sep><sep> (1) Sometimes we count on guarding that the expression "lapress", as it also includes "audio-visual", and where "media" could appear more quickly. <sep><sep> He says "What right are you seeking, are you looking for Labour Act, are you looking for Severance Allowance, are you saying not to tax you anymore. He said that the rights sought had disappeared. <sep><sep> Sometimes it is associated with a cycle of the lalinn, a process from very far away. <sep><sep> The class organization of workers in a terrible disorder: there are many communal organizations recruited from workers, and they are subsidized by the State. <sep><sep> We want an electoral reform that deepens democracy and changes political power itself, and that we will only get this during times of mass mobilization. <sep><sep> We intend to explain a little more about this and how we will use this program and how we will present this program in elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some companies like Air Mauritius and Mauritius Telecom have severely discriminated against the union. <sep>

<sep> On Saturday, 12th August, the LALIT Women's Commission met for discussions and planning of work. <sep>
<sep> There were tournaments where Morisyen cheered and shouted every time the opposition scored. <sep>
<sep> Gaetan Seneque has appointed the editor of Le Mauricien who is developing the online version of the newspaper, and today he is in semi-retirement. <sep>
<sep> In LALIT, we support this demand, and we are taking it further: there should not have been a new Identity Card system. <sep>
<sep> Now well, we were still engaged, as my father who was engaged as a mason to rebuild houses there. <sep>
<sep> Let's look at the list of resignations: In fact, there are eleven resignations. <sep>
<sep> and Mauritian workers are finding licenses with Ciel, Floreal Knitwear and other delocalized companies to go to London and France. <sep>
<sep> A lot of teeth, I find that Ally is nodding his head, we all have heard military airplanes in black entering Mauritius to provide disaster relief. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Due to the bourgeoisie imposing a very strict numeric ranking class, it is often threatened by workers who merely or openly rebel against it. <sep> He states that the La Chaumiere project is not good for the environment (without considering the carbon dioxide emissions, as businesses in the east do), in the conflict between Mulin Laconcorde and STC, Berenger says that the Laconcorde sugar factory does its painting 'carelessly'. <sep> LPT has written to the Prime Minister asking for English and Mauritian Creole to become the official languages of Parliament, without preventing anyone from using French or Bhojpuri. <sep> When Paul Berenger defends the communal best loser system, he faces emotional and irrational reactions from minorities, and he occasionally mentions a specific minority. <sep> * What has been decisive in our campaign is our initiative to launch a Peace Flotilla to Diego Garcia. <sep> The Government and the Opposition are continuing on the basis of the Sithanen Report. <sep> The aim of this campaign is to isolate Lindsey Collen, to provoke and paralyze LALIT in a time when it is a political organization resisting the policies of the Berenger-Jugnauth Government. <sep> It aims to develop its intellectual, emotional, and daily cultural development. <sep> Route 443 connects Tel Aviv to East Jerusalem and cuts through the West Bank; however, it is reserved exclusively for other Israelis. Palestinians are not allowed to use this road. <sep> This partial election resulted in a "feudal" duel between two corrupt forces, without it being influenced by article opinions of editorialists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> I was present, I asked for assistance on what to do in case of a present aggressor. <sep><sep> If Plan Gokhool materializes, a single reform "timid" that Obeegadoo had started to implement. <sep><sep> With these 4 elements of analysis in hand, Lindsey has traced the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict since the Berlin Conference of 1895, the Balfour Declaration in 1917 during the First World War. <sep><sep> where lastly the 2nd had 4 transitional slogans, actions where the Ministry of Finance, a radio program, newspaper articles, articles on the website, a series of forums. <sep><sep> Today, the trade union which is pro-government, invites the Minister of the PMSD in its functions. <sep><sep> When he sets things in motion among zealots, his dance makes you and everyone else stand “side by side” while waiting for here to say, then waiting for Privy Council to say on what Resistans & Co set before the Court. <sep><sep> Even a section of the Trade Union Movement is looking into the interests by sector and negotiating agreements benefiting all parties involved. <sep><sep> D'Unienville, and Kris Punusamy, all these intellectuals, with fine values, still in favor of a communal classification to allow BLS to continue. <sep><sep> to Ensure greater representation of women in Parliament and introduce a proportional quota, they presented a ridiculous law, then hastily withdrew it. <sep><sep> It is quite clear why this new legal framework has been established. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And finally, Eva Caille had reached an emotional and physical peak in her dance, with a performance so fluid that it seemed "inevitable." <sep><sep> On stage, they hold absolute power, just as all bosses in the capitalist system do. <sep><sep> In Lalit, we ask people to reflect on alternative ways of looking at the economy and question the monopoly of decisions by business owners on the economy of Mauritius. <sep><sep> All members, sympathizers and readers of Revi have received a free copy. <sep><sep> With the strength of the Non-Aligned Movement at the time, this motion forced a debate in the United Nations. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we find three levels of trade unionism: <sep><sep> When Obama tries to raise the ceiling to borrow money, it provokes an ideological conflict, a conflict so serious it led to a deadlock in these last two weeks when we're heading towards the fateful date, the 2nd of September. <sep><sep> So here, the bourgeoisie together with the government, are finding ways to make Mauritius survive by reducing worker salaries, working conditions, and employment opportunities. <sep><sep> They had become experts at serving the interests of the state apparatus to do as they pleased. <sep><sep> So, as since just before noon on the 12th, when a meeting had considered everything, GWF then decided to call for a general strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economic crisis in the Eurozone has had its repercussions in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Moreover, the financial capital had developed quite well between the years 1900 and 1914. <sep><sep> Also, this instinctive greed was quite widespread. <sep><sep> In the context of Mother Tongue Day in Africa in 2006, Pushpa Lallah participated in a conference in Cape Town for the preparation of a Pan-African Children's History Dictionary which will be released in a dozen African languages. <sep><sep> A member of the Resistance told me he found "lots of unionists not too serious". <sep><sep> Whenever he showed up, it wasn't what they were talking about. <sep><sep> And when he did that, he was criticized by his own worker base, he was criticized by his own petit-bourgeois base because he was going forward with his own official program. <sep><sep> When we arrived, the Army and the Police were already there. <sep><sep> Until Berenger found out that the Statistical Office was miscalculating the unemployment figures! <sep><sep> When we entered, tear gas canisters were being fired and villages were being abandoned. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kimanyer will mobilize people, and get people's support, and people's enthusiasm for this program. <sep> Often, there is a divide in the evening between the two major political parties, which both favor the capitalist system; <sep> (An exercise that many members of LALIT have already done is calculate how much money comes into Le Mauricien or L'Express from paid advertising, how much from its front page in one week, one month a year, and during Christmas. <sep> They only have one argument, and their argument is mainly because they do not inform on the scientific evidence of the importance of learning in the mother tongue, especially for the cognitive development of children, or they do not know what to do when using a language that is not the child's immediate environment - cognitive editor, emotional editor, cultural editor, human rights editor. <sep> If, at the time, there was a more consistent Socialist or Communist Party, as there were in many countries as well, such as Chile, France, Indonesia, Laos, India, South Africa. <sep> You can visit our website

relations when her husband wants to; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Apart from a handful of racists, everyone agreed that discrimination and exclusion against Afro-Creoles need to stop. <sep><sep> In this case, it was noted that Currimjee had started producing soap. <sep><sep> They paid some money to find a rose, they came, they drank their cigarettes, they bent their knees, they sat and looked at the rose. <sep><sep> There was an innovation: it is in Creole and there is also an English version. <sep><sep> They maintained their lalin lalit of classes, they displayed their union. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the language of Langleter has been lost, and so has its appeal. <sep><sep> It was a lot of things, but it wasn't a joke. <sep><sep> Monday 7th Ut 2006, starting at 6.30pm, Esplanade Municipal Port-Louis. <sep><sep> When the Government brought projects to turn villages into cities, it was already a political scam. <sep><sep> And many families have lost loved ones, but we never knew where those people died. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In countries like London, Africa, here, there was such a trend. <sep><sep> Bureaucratization and strict mobilization are increasingly prevalent across sectors. <sep><sep> - Why have MSM-MMM-PMSD broken the Village Council and abolished village elections? <sep><sep> Policeman Ganga smiled at them and told them that all of this was unnecessary. <sep><sep> So, we also need to address these ecological crises. <sep><sep> In his rhetoric, Ziz Seetulsing said that it is not possible for a Ziz to know which "community" each candidate belongs to lest it becomes like "Big Brother". <sep><sep> what is the first official treaty between the Mauritian government and the British government since the Chagos were taken over for military purposes? <sep><sep> We have also organized in Mauritius, keeping watch with former President Cassam Uteem, CTSP, and the Idrice Goomany Center. <sep><sep> Selling its strength, its capacity to beat people, for money. <sep><sep> They only have 2 ways of working, the CID Mauritius, in the absence of these modern scientific methods. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many members have developed a lot of knowledge after the lecture that Rada gave on "Work and Peace", and after that article we studied by Rosa Luxemburg, which is somewhat similar in size, but more extensive. <sep> Planter W., his wife L., they have four sons and other family members. <sep> Even if it is demagogic, the Ptr has up to the last moment been forced to put emphasis on the misery that exists in constituency number 7 with economic insecurity and the economic crisis in which people are living. <sep> It is a crisis where clearly there are economic losses. <sep> And it is funny that, during an economic crisis, the state tends to focus on worker class favoritism rather than expenses, solely because they cannot bring economic improvements at such a time. <sep> Fifteen weeks is tight, after a repressive law was in force for 174 years. <sep> A candidate for general elections, according to this same article, can get an A, B, C, D, or otherwise an E. <sep> So it is normal that in these regions there are more motivated militants to stand as candidates. <sep> The government has supported capitalists with public money, voted on labor laws that make it easier for employers to lay off workers, and change work contracts in favor of employers. <sep> F. has asked us to visit the school under construction in Deir Ballut. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> More particularly, during the Rio conference in 1992, Mauritius ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. <sep><sep> This is a distinction, a very serious matter, that I notice, and that many people can forget, or even dominate because they do not even know. <sep><sep> Today, if the unions are demobilizing, they have a revolutionary experience that has transformed in its opposite. <sep><sep> The way the work was going on was ambiguous, all workers entered work in the morning, and what came to work before, it chose a gang for him to work in a field, a gangster that was the best. <sep><sep> He had two attempts against him, which brought even more repression. <sep><sep> The banking crisis of 2007, the crisis of the diminishing oil stock, the food crisis affecting world levels do not provide enough for this growing population, the environmental crisis when there is not enough oxygen compared to carbon dioxide (more than 8 dangerous elements exceeding), the global economic crisis, the current Euro crisis. <sep><sep> The five-year-old boy had just finished eating and was playing in the living room. <sep><sep> And together with a campaign to change union leaders, to pull out those

industry, but rather use it to develop new agro-industrial sectors, non-GMOs, including fish farming and rabbits. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And he has gone so far as to a point reached in 1982, when Berenger was Minister of Finance, he signed a Letter of Intent with the World Bank where he made a commitment, while Minister of Finance, to implement an ultra-liberal policy here. <sep><sep> He thus mentioned the names of Jean Suzanne and Lise Coindreau as examples. <sep><sep> However, LALIT has a problem with the situation where there is manipulation. <sep><sep> There will be food, drinks, dancing, and music performances. <sep><sep> So, even on a symbolic level, it is quite difficult to find it as an Alliance. <sep><sep> The conflict that clearly exists now between the Government and the Sugar Industry is primarily about this matter of 1,500 to 2,000 arpents of land, establishment owners are not in agreement. <sep><sep> We had several neighborhood meetings to explain our mode of operation for going to vote but to put a big cross on the ballot. <sep><sep> What is happening in the Middle Oryan is important because we are finding ways to call for a Constitutional Assembly, for example in Tinizi. <sep><sep> He goes, he even turns, in a single day in the capital he can make a lap around the island 5, 6 up to 10 times. <sep><sep> he did this courageous thing where the workers of Tropic Knits gathered where the embassy intervened after one of their comrades at work had died. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The recent general election has just shown the true face of the bourgeoisie in Mauritius. <sep><sep> So, when thinking of Darwin coming forward, they say, "Abe, never have we said God made only one cookie, God made the lizards provide and the ants bake." <sep><sep> We are going through an economic crisis, and the people need to understand that the government they have elected has the intention to face the crisis, what the backbench MPs are saying and what the Opposition is proposing. <sep><sep> When they see the reality of why they have lost their houses, they find that it is essentially financial capital. <sep><sep> LALIT, we belong to a political tradition that finds political strategies very differently. <sep><sep> Spontaneous resistance phase 1: 1965-71: This was a time when there was spontaneous resistance against deportation, often passive resistance, where people were refusing to leave Chagos. <sep><sep> and soon they will have that capacity, as long as there is a capitalist system, an exploitative system, soon it will have that capacity. <sep><sep> The United Nations set up an Ad-Hoc Committee to implement Resolution 1971. <sep><sep> Reunification of Chagos with all other islands in the Republic of Mauritius. <sep><sep> Almost 90% of the people working in this sector work on fixed-term contracts, meaning they get a 3-month, 6-month, 1-year contract. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Uncle Koulall and Aunt Alice have accepted me to stay with them. <sep><sep> Enemies are enemies in the West, in America in particular, companies are relocating their production, relocating their administration. <sep><sep> Therefore, it imprisons this strategy established according to its four "clusters" which will reign in Mauritius, with the Government as its chief strategist. <sep><sep> It has gone through a crooked time on the feudal system, on the slavery system, the language system, and now the forced labor system. <sep><sep> Just as we call it "viral marketing", meaning that it spreads like a virus, one person infects another, as if he agrees, as if he has no say in it. <sep><sep> So, this process is important in explaining why there is a story, a phenomenon, in Marxist theory that we call the phenomenon of "alienation". <sep><sep> It is a bourgeoisie itself, now, but it is under the control of the State. <sep><sep> The US military arsenal is pointing towards Iran, Iran is threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, and this threat is causing oil prices to soar on the global market. <sep><sep> This means they have continued to centralize the power, continue to strengthen power. <sep><sep> So, to solve these problems, it is not individual solutions that will help much. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That's true, even in the luxury resorts in England and Sweden, where there are no language problems, and they lie about where you work. <sep><sep> But you can reverse this trend when society takes control of what is happening at work. <sep><sep> What we are proposing is not based on lies. <sep><sep> - Then we will have reasonable arguments - as in the former Yugoslavia, and in Libya. <sep><sep> It is interesting to find the interest of all residents in this recording-experiment site. <sep><sep> If they were serious, they would have responded to certain points. <sep><sep> So we need to invent a way. <sep><sep> This is in line with what LALIT had predicted 5-6 years ago. <sep><sep> You know, when the dilapidated buildings become a nest. <sep><sep> Furthermore, the Government has already made a salary compensation in January. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In addition, workers are facing an increase in the cost of living which has reached 8.8% at the Me level, and could reach 10% at the Zen level. <sep><sep> Prime Minister Paul Berenger is receiving a salary of Rs121,500.00 per month, excluding his other allowances. <sep><sep> State-owned company Rodclean is outsourcing and closing down factories to be replaced by private contracts. <sep><sep> Trade unions, NRB, IRC, and the Minister of Labour are all part of the same mechanism. <sep><sep> Moreover, at the beginning they presented our Alliance as a "blue-white-red" alliance. <sep><sep> And those IRS bungalows that were sold for millions of rupees, Sithanen did not say if the prices were reasonable? <sep><sep> Since 2008, we have had three different Finance Ministers from three different parties, Rama Sithanen from the Labor Party, Pravind Jugnauth from MSM, and Xavier Duval from PMSD. <sep><sep> During an electoral campaign, everything you say has to be popular, especially through the media, it marginalizes deliberately without looking at political programs and the political history of the parties. <sep><sep> * Allowing employers to lay off workers without paying Severance Allowances, and only giving 30 days' notice. <sep><sep> "Berenger has tried to control this and turn it into an electoral advantage. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government should focus on developing agricultural and agro-industrial production (as it seeks to please clients of hotel patrons), organize warehouses. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister himself yesterday spoke with Ed Miliband and told him "which you did not respect the commitment" has been taken so that all discussions on any issue must take place in bilateral forums. <sep><sep> Mr. Minister, today you are announcing the construction of a new school, you are imposing mandatory schooling on children, but you are reconsidering the decision on the use of the mother tongue in education. <sep><sep> LALIT has often described it: the historical bourgeoisie (all communities confused) tried to bar this new petite-bourgeoisie looking to become the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> The LALIT Trade Union Commission met this Sunday, November 20 at 10:00 a.m. <sep><sep> It had its own botanical garden that was considered a gem, a wonder on Planet Earth. <sep><sep> Lindsey, from Cher: Yannick, my darling, has integrated us into “nationalism” and “Mauritianism” very well in its Opening Discourse. <sep><sep> Contrary to other political parties like Workers, MMM, MSM, PMSD who are just looking at who should rule the existing capitalist state, what we are aiming for is to end exploitation and domination of one class by another social class. <sep><sep> This leaden weight that oppressed people for 30 years is starting to lift. <sep><sep> their majority in the House of Representatives (Democrats usually have a majority in the Senate today) to impose a more

officials are not saying who they are holding, but confirm that there are prisoners in "undisclosed location". <sep><sep> However, historical experiences have shown us that we need to make a conscious effort to ensure that this "Worker State" does not become a permanent bureaucracy. <sep><sep> Princess Prathna developed a passion for animals, insects, plants, herbs and flowers. <sep><sep> The penultimate image is Olivier smiling on a beach, and the final one is a photo of a paradise beach. <sep><sep> Ram: A confusion for 8 years, and there is confusion that has been entertained for 8

disappears: a thief's coat, a treasure hunter's coat, an Ali Baba's Cave coat, a mist coat. <sep><sep> However, if it becomes a strategy that includes dangers when raising 'Mauritian' as an ideological form, it can be a challenge. <sep><sep> There is an "Occupy Wall Street" movement in more than 100 cities in the United States with a occupation against capital, and against the way capitalism is going. <sep><sep> The twelfth step is waiting for slaves to work in houses and in cars. <sep><sep> Because there was a shortage of food, people were breaking each other, fish were drinking oil, people were taking jobs in areas they themselves called zones of suffering. <sep><sep> If it cannot be resolved in a timely manner, then you can either send the dispute to a court if both parties agree or you can go on strike. <sep><sep> Can we combat food insecurity in this way? <sep><sep> After that, we have the Industrial Relations Act, which has bureaucratized all unions and continues to make all strikes illegal. <sep><sep> But at the same time, the quality of work principles and codes of conduct in worker class organizations are making a big difference in the quality of the movement we are building to resist the austerity that the capitalist class is imposing on us. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> S. is going to Marad for an evaluation of the IWPS Olive Oil team

class situation in Mauritius, we will find that they are very tightly knit in terms of numbers, so these parties need to come up with a popular and demagogic program to win the working class vote. <sep> <sep> That is, what about overtime or defining the weekend according to the clock 24/7. <sep> <sep> Finally, Lindsey Collen, who was presiding over a resolution to boycott Israeli products (with

We had a session with him on the situation for the working class and union and political movements in Australia. <sep> <sep> And our party supports him among all the other organizations with a working class outlook. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Let's sit down, let's analyze it together with the workers, translate it in Creole, and publish it. <sep><sep> For example, there have been developments where Rodriguez, where Rada Kistnasamy and Roland Fozoo went to a political visit and animated several meetings there in March. <sep><sep> They even placed a bomb in an Afghan village during a wedding ceremony. <sep><sep> On the day his reign started, all of them took notice of it, gave him half for food, but told him he had to close himself in a correctional disk. <sep><sep> In fact, since 2009, or even before, we have opposed this Project. <sep><sep> It might be appropriate for the LPT to have a single conference, where it enables all federations to unify. <sep><sep> Yesterday they said that they demanded this from the Prime Minister in a letter on January 12. <sep><sep> Abu C. says that he needs another 2 days to finish his harvest. <sep><sep> He wasn't elected

We have managed to develop a form of cooperation with CTSP and during a period with the Kuppan and Ramjuttun federations, Idriss Goomany Center, sometimes ICP, MAA. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have called this regional democratic gentleman in the rural sector.<sep><sep> We know that in 1999, when the sugar crisis began to return accompanied by police violence, and now, many people still do not have jobs, the sugar crisis is increasing. <sep><sep> Importantly, there are writers who write in Creole that are interesting to know new Creole spelling. <sep><sep> We denounce the Integrated Resorts Schemes from all points of view: it is destroying the land, polluting the environment, wasting water resources on golf courses and swimming pools. <sep><sep> If you only watch from below, you may say that everything is fine, but for 3 months we have been putting up this struggle. <sep><sep> When we take stock, sometimes we forget the long work of reflection, coordination, and care that LALIT activists do. <sep><sep> And its financial system is bankrupting its productive sector. <sep><sep> But if anyone has done anything, it is this action in 1983, initiated by MMM-PSM. <sep><sep> The Workers' Party was forced to say it would restore Village Elections. <sep><sep> Now, with a cynical calculation, it is saying that it is the fault of the small villages that it is proposing to postpone municipal elections until 2006. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The recent conflict around CT Power symbolizes a form of extreme democratization of the economy. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin, on behalf of Lalit, has explained how there is a flaw attached to the Constitution of the country that provides for 8 consecutive prime ministerial terms. <sep><sep> Therefore, what Minister Boolell has demonstrated in his speech is a strategy based primarily on "constructive bilateral dialogue" rather than an attack tactic. <sep><sep> Instead of simply focusing on accountability, where revenue and expenditure balance, the government is implementing a program including the abolition of the Multifiber Agreement bringing licensing and job reduction in the Free Zones as well as the progressive dismantling of the Security Protocol that is destroying jobs in the security industry. <sep><sep> Ashok Subron has stated that the philosophy of this program is to challenge political power directly, and question the logic of the capitalist system. <sep><sep> It is important to remember that Kaya's death provoked a generalized attack against the State in all neighborhoods. <sep><sep> The latest two resignations, that is, a comrade in Rodrigues calling Alain Genave, and Devianand Narrain (who resigned well after others). <sep><sep> So, just to say where our political program stands, it has already given you an idea of the framework of our political program. <sep><sep> And secondly, what interests us, is that a program for elections has been designed, primarily based on the political work that LALIT has been undertaking in the 5 years leading up to the general elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He remembered his promise to come? <sep><sep> You will not go far with that attitude. <sep><sep> It's a simple matter, on one hand, and on the other, many people have experience doing it. <sep><sep> During lunch, Nasfat called to say that the army had taken his ID when he was showing the ISM 4 olive trees that the army had cut down the night before. <sep><sep> Starting in the '80s, there was a big session in the GWF: Jack Bizlall, as if we had never had a rational public explanation, why he did it, he took all the para-state syndicates that he was looking after, he took them, went to form another Federation, the Federation of Para-Statal Bodies Union, which later became the FPU. <sep><sep> There was a big "Watch for Palestine" in Grand River (up to its last memorable moments) just before the motion came to the UN. <sep><sep> countries like Australia, Brazil, and Thailand are calling it "dumping" through their subsidy system, Europe is encouraging overproduction, and this is putting pressure on world market prices. <sep><sep> Just click on the cover photo on the homepage, below. <sep><sep> However, the Minister of Labor announced that he did not "believe in bosses" and even the police have not yet presented an explanation. <sep><sep> In the City of London, ¾ of transactions take place between different businesses in the same building. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is in the process of offering France a platform for him to have a clean region in the Indian Ocean. <sep> <sep> Until successive governments have hidden its political error. <sep> <sep> So, it is a heterogeneous assembly, where everyone stands up as an individual, everyone and their mother in their army has adheredin unison. <sep> <sep> We all know what "creative" means in this context. <sep> <sep> So the New Life Movement (NLM) initially was a small group. <sep> <sep> This wagon represents a central point in the systemic crisis that Mauritius is going through. <sep> <sep> And then once the party is in general, we apply this policy, until which we question in the strict sense of the party, and then, naturally, we change party strategy. <sep> <sep> A historical roadblock is a political phenomenon, based on economic reality and class reality. <sep> <sep> But no one seems to know how the workers work in this area. <sep> <sep> In the beginning, the people accepted to eat their bitter melon, but the laughter of hope declined, a sense of bitterness and revolt began to appear on the city's mirrors as in the countryside. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At Ferney Spinning, for example, where a lawsuit was filed because the employer changed their working hours from the usual 45 hours per week to 52½ hours per week, Minister Soodhun spoke strongly against the employer. <sep><sep> In this book, Engels and Morgan documented the research done on the former slave society. <sep><sep> But these two things were predictable, they weren't surprises, they weren't shocks as he makes you believe. <sep><sep> The final defeat was on Pon Gran Rivyer. <sep><sep> For example: the trade union CAWU, Ashok Subron's status and influence in the GWF federation depend on the fact that he sits in both the Delegate and Executive Assembly of GWF while being a Technical Advisor of CAWU. <sep><sep> Their first son, Tamby, looked like his dad but when you looked closely in his eyes, you could see his mom. <sep><sep> Sometimes through his actions, such as Gordon Gentil organizing meetings with Ramgoolam - all this to get the Workers involved in a kind of "special alliance" with certain trade union leaders allegedly de-gauche, with anti-crime militants allegedly de-gauche. <sep><sep> On the 15th of September, 20 Lalit militants distributed a leaflet. <sep><sep> The demolished house is still there as a reminder of this atrocity. <sep><sep> There were Jin Fei, NeoTown, CT Power, which are foreign companies coming from China, India, Singapore/Malaysia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, they can say again, "No", they can think about it for some more time. <sep><sep> And this reminds us of the name that L'Estrac made famous when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the first MMM government, "Jean Claude Riverain de L'Estrac". <sep><sep> They are not affected by any elections, by any election results. <sep><sep> In the past, there have been attempts at the international level to favor private capital dominance, to try to make sure that the protection and guarantee of international bourgeoisie capital like the MAI (Multi-Lateral Agreement on Investment) is ensured. <sep><sep> Even if the mountain is not pretty, even if the sun is setting, he does not care. <sep><sep> In the past, we have distributed bills on site, meaning a specific bill for a license, a sector, a place where the bill has a problem in that sector, and elsewhere there are more general political issues. <sep><sep> Because for a long time in the ideological sessions that I was participating in, we were talking about the class position, and where you stand. <sep><sep> We had a launch of the Palestinian Diary in Zanvye that Kinsa wrote after his time in Palestine. <sep><sep> Today UNESCO is recognizing the contribution of LPT in the production, publication, and circulation of all kinds of literature in Kreol and Bhojpuri languages. <sep><sep> Not only is it dealing with Diego Garcia illegally, using our land to house a civilian population, not only is it contaminating the Indian Ocean and its nuclear waste on Diego. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So they have an electoral program and in that electoral program, there are many things that they announce and many things they announce that are popular because they need to get votes in an election. <sep><sep> Then MMM denounced this as confiscation of the rights of the people of Mauritius. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we find it a very vague, empty concept, and it can also be very dangerous. <sep><sep> On one hand, criminal repression against the Palestinian people condemned by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). <sep><sep> We want to invest in creating jobs that produce food, produce renewable energy, and provide good working conditions. <sep><sep> In the trade union movement, we have found that the trade union movement is continuing to fragment and weaken. <sep><sep> Sometimes, when we talk about the lack of mobilization in the working class - and Yves was talking about the fact that there is a Stalinist regime that is not working. <sep><sep> But this violence is decreasing with this new form of social organization like the Council. <sep><sep> This year, they are conducting a campaign on 56 days, one day symbolizing each year of the occupation by the State of Israel. <sep><sep> This is because we have enough regulations to reflect, discuss, and counter this propaganda together. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some employers are having to close their businesses, so they are not happy. <sep><sep> On his side, Governor Krazkor, he didn't want to forget. <sep><sep> But tell me, this endless hunger you are thinking of, will it limit, until the end? <sep><sep> The army soldiers are making every effort to keep people away even far from the borders of Israel and it seems to be succeeding. <sep><sep> Without counting that all readers share a common ground. <sep><sep> But, him, he waits deadlock, then he takes position. <sep><sep> With the economic crisis in Europe, the ICT/BPO sector, we can expect that this sector will go through crises that will make working conditions even more difficult. <sep><sep> For capitalism to survive, it needs this widespread exploitation of the majority of workers, to keep control in the hands of the minority capitalist. <sep><sep> And use this to accumulate more capital. But with neoliberalism, it implies that there is no alternative, especially economically. <sep><sep> Key principle: IMAGE AND REALITY OF THE ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT by Professor Norman G. Finkelstein, 2002. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> koni kuma Miray Aparteid, ki truv anfas zot lakaz. <sep><sep> The state continues to subsidize and nourish all kinds of communal-religious entities that sow discord: <sep><sep> In 2011, we predicted that Pakistan would become central in global geopolitics. <sep><sep> Last Wednesday, the EDUCATION FOR WORKERS received the UNESCO LITERACY AWARD in a glittering celebration held at the Q. Bornes Ministry of Culture. <sep><sep> Just as often, poverty brought a little ray of sunshine amidst the dark clouds; the specter of death made people quiver. <sep><sep> The Chinese government's strategy to strengthen its tribal leaders and tribal militias has bolstered its position with its own populace. <sep><sep> The law in France against "social welfare abuses" is much harsher than in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Will the Settlements vote within electoral boundaries, and will the Palestinian villages located near Israeli settlements be allowed to vote or not? <sep><sep> Each time a demand is separated from its end, it is reconsidered. <sep><sep> All this represents a knowledge base that can be used for the development of a transformation industry and the preservation of agricultural products for local and export markets. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This section reveals a tendency of favoring Fabian (meaning believing in universal benefits, not possible) and supporting a certain welfare state. <sep><sep> Now, you can find the last post in front, and the post inside. <sep><sep> Today, with this new communal mobilization, new demands for a new community losing the best, even more classification for the population, which can be very negative. <sep><sep> It may be for 1999, although we could not intervene while it was happening because it was throughout Mauritius. <sep><sep> It has led to a grotesque rupee depreciation of 26%, which means that establishment owners have received full compensation for the guarantee price. <sep><sep> It is in crisis, people think, because the Government has spent too much, either "because of corruption, waste, favoritism", or "because of dumping Lasinn", "because of absenteeism", "because Mauritians lack education, there is a mismatch between job positions and Mauritian diplomas", "because of lack of foreign investment" – and all this is true. <sep><sep> In the next 2-3 years, we will face great difficulties in this country. <sep><sep> It is not just the 8 Best Losers classified by the State after an election. <sep><sep> However, the economic measure announced by Finance Minister Sithanen does not indicate any real sanctions for the development orientation: many words on the tourism industry, no dependency reduction on sugar cane, etc. <sep><sep> LALIT is organizing a seminar on the Expanded Historical Block, Detached Bourgeoisie & Democratization of the Economy on Friday 2 November, 9.30am - 3 pm, at LPT Building, Grand River. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a chance, a check on the CEB account for each CEB subscriber. <sep> It is also important for all militants to understand that true equality in education is not about abolishing class inequality, and that we cannot separate the two sides. <sep> If a friend is used to going on Youtube, listening to Lamars March 10, there are 7-8 people who have intervened to promote it. <sep> But, if people understand that access to the beach is an advantage for everyone, the answer for Eddy is also, they bring a lawsuit. <sep> People know how to make jam, sauces, pickles, jelly with all kinds of fruits and vegetables. <sep> The MSM has not been away from power either. <sep> On Monday, when I arrived at The House, I went with Lulu who came from the US to pick olives in the olive grove near The House. <sep> Sure enough, if the power had been cut off, there would have been no water. <sep> So, there are sufferings ahead: insecurity in work, unrest in neighborhoods, and all corners that are used to keeping different aspects of our life separate, they collapse, and all become one. <sep> Moreover, Dr. White has turned against Dr. Ramstein's reissue, and at the same time, he has brought in the police to use violence. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The minimum wage has been considered by the Ministry of Labour S. Mohamed as a hope for workers, the replacement of the National Pay Council by the National Tripartite Forum seen as a major victory for the trade union movement. <sep><sep> Similarly, a single cut, macro and micro, but also thinking, that though a beautiful me, and many other me, to become bad me, me that should not be used... <sep><sep> He also invited to intervene in the Public Service International which brings together GSA, FPBOU, and the trade unions of Local Government. <sep><sep> Fami A. to let us know how the alarm arrived. <sep><sep> For the education sector, the Government is encouraging the implementation of a series of private universities from abroad in Mauritius, as well as local private universities. <sep><sep> Now Ram- goolam is taking up his new position on PR with other political visas: <sep><sep> Gramsci perfected Marx's perspective of ideology as the creation of a group that in practice mixes with other ideologies and brings power relations in very different ways. <sep><sep> We have also carried out a dinner and evaluation at the same time. <sep><sep> In general, Lindsey Collen has been supported, she is pro-MMM, not by their editorial choices or their will. <sep><sep> And there are many sectors where unemployment threatens - the hotel sector, the textile and manufacturing sectors, the ICT-BPO sector is not exempt! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The employer is very clear in the newspaper: they want to increase prices in the shops. <sep><sep> In this sense, she wants the World Social Forum to be part of this recovery, while also confronting globalization. <sep><sep> If we have given Jin Fei and Patel 99 years, will we offer 99 years to Diego as well? <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen replied that the current Finance Minister has a rather "accountant" mindset, focusing on technical matters, when he should be looking at the social aspect. <sep><sep> Where trade union bureaucracy and interest groups move, in the absence of working class mobilization, there are some who seem to find "strategies" as a series of maneuvers, actions (or threatened actions). <sep><sep> So, we are in politics in this Conference. <sep><sep> The new PT-PMSD government is ruling with a majority with 2 ex-MSM members that Ramgoolam has reconciled and with the support of the Rodrigues Movement. <sep><sep> New Finance Minister Rama Sithanen is confirming the trend of the Social Alliance Government to favor the private sector in general, and to continue to expose Mauritius to a dangerous way to all problems of the international capitalist system. <sep><sep> Tensions rose when on December 18, Israeli forces launched an air raid near the Gaza border and killed 5 Palestinians who Israel claims were preparing to fire rockets at their territory. <sep><sep> Subron adopted a strategy that he believed would replace Berenger. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Because the 70 people in Parliament pass a law that Bambous, where we live, will become a city. <sep><sep> To contribute to bringing about socialism, it needs to be more unified, more mobilized, and more conscious that it is a class. <sep><sep> Felix is supposed to represent the interests of farmers and workers, that is to say, artisans and laborers. <sep><sep> It is necessary for the holy water to fall, the end of the death spiral, and to prepare spiritually to receive the sun. <sep><sep> They have had the opportunity to meet people with revolutionary experience there. <sep><sep> Palestinian Minister Anzarz and the prisoner defense organization, Addameer, have demanded an investigation into the death of Arafat Jaradat. <sep><sep> It's a follow-up to our last 2 Conferences. <sep><sep> But all these concessions do not represent a shift in the Government's economic policy: they are simply small concessions that the government is making, and we will analyze why this is happening. <sep><sep> So the question is, would there have been a long way to go. <sep><sep> You are wrong because you are teaching children two foreign languages ​​at the same time, speaking in an approximate way, speaking in an approximate way. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Our political program, as a party, is an understanding of the political work we have to do to reach our goal. <sep><sep> And it has been able to demonstrate that everything the media says is not true. <sep><sep> But, because they were absent for 3 days, they did not work. <sep><sep> And this is not a question that he is happy to have that authority over him. <sep><sep> This plan MAAS, the Minister of Finance who presented this Lerop. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen also spoke about the movements in the history that has brought many benefits to the working class. <sep><sep> The International Committee on Civil and Political Rights has condemned the Mauritian State for this in their "Concluding Observations" in April 2005. <sep><sep> and on the meeting that the Government and the Opposition have had with Mr. Patrick Fairweather, Deputy Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. <sep><sep> And they continue on, when you see the banners. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, we know that our country has been guided from abroad since its birth. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We, members of LALIT, understand these demands, and defend them consciously. <sep> In 1990, during a visit, President Mitterand of France put all kinds of pressure on the government for Air Mauritius to buy Airbus planes. <sep> Employers do not have the right to negotiate with him alone, to sign agreements with him alone. <sep> Berenger is making people believe that Valayden and the Government are favoring "violence and drugs", and making people vulnerable to danger. <sep> In the Security Industry, when there is a mobilization leading to a strike, the Minister of Labor, Deputy Nita Deerpalsing, Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, all intervene to prevent the strike. <sep> on a full bucket of iron and steel tears and small ransom, sometimes a ray of love, through a hole in the needle; sometimes a child is born and his smile reflects routine; <sep> It is necessary to understand that there are two poles of attraction for the moment: there is a Trade Union Common Platform that brings together all union federations except the Degos Trade Union Confederation. <sep> If a worker agrees to work more than 8hours, then the employer must pay them overtime once and a half more. <sep> And these same "decentralized saints" can sometimes become a path for other "civil society" demands, but which will support working-class leadership, as in environmental issues, HIV-AIDS, education, theft, security in neighborhoods. <sep> Spain has a major problem, it has a 20% unemployment rate, and it reaches 40-50% among young people between 18 and 25 years old. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The education system should aim to promote debate, reflection, and mobilization to address the various issues that concern people in their everyday lives. <sep><sep> The various political regimes in Mauritius since independence have significantly contributed to strengthening America's position through their principle-less policies and deals regarding Chagos and other bases. <sep><sep> This initiative sets us apart from the other political forces that are not addressing the real problems, but rather the more serious ones like corruption that are not causing economic crises. <sep><sep> If Marx and Engels' Manifesto is translated into Creole and published by LALIT, you will see that indeed, even in this Program, there is a threefold critique. <sep><sep> However, they have also clearly stated that it is anti-politics, which is quite dangerous. <sep><sep> We had a meeting with the author of "Island of Shame," David Vine. <sep><sep> So everyone in the meeting agreed to set another date to continue the meeting. <sep><sep> For example, it would be very easy for the Government to spend money on these pensions, which are all 17,000 rupees or more per month. <sep><sep> So they need to be cautious about these three styles to be able to translate the scrap paper. <sep><sep> On the day they claimed to have "insulted the police," on the 19th of December 2002, the Platform against Bush held a press conference and a private meeting to organize a demonstration against Bush. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before the lockdown to go to the University of Salfit would only take 10 minutes. <sep> They are not an NGO calling themselves activists, they are taking action without a program. <sep> What we need to do now is to rally the political will among workers, unite the working class around these demands! <sep> bring together three creative thinkers who are also activists in practice, Ram Seegobin, Jean-Claude Bibi and Oupa Lehulere. <sep> * In Rafat, we did not forget the family of the late M.A. <sep> Kamini gradually realized that every time there was a complicated situation, he found himself in front of Auntie Bagya's door or Auntie Bagya's door seemed to appear in front of his gate. <sep> Year after year the demand for justice will continue to increase and we will continue to mobilize for the present government coming: <sep> Yesterday, 2 young people from the Lalit Youth Group, along with a Lalit delegation for the WSF, went to Mumbai. <sep> with his minister put a spotlight on the case of Madam Savriacooty, who suffered a sexual assault in front of the police. <sep> Today the government is converting the student's right to an "elite" that can be easily woven. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, there are these 2 types of unions, one called a company union which regroups workers within a company, and another called a trade union, which regroups workers in the same profession but in different companies. <sep><sep> And the current government for a bad economic development style where despite knowing that these traditional economic pillars have no future, they have persisted. <sep><sep> It is not surprising if we understand the example that I am describing here. <sep><sep> From there, it says, they have a Action Plan to introduce sugar cane intercropping for food security. <sep><sep> It is during a dinner a casteist meeting that Berenger made threats against freedom of expression. <sep><sep> New evidence on Tatinn Timi faded across the country like fire on a mountain when the wind blows. <sep><sep> With education being made compulsory, there is a Medco college there, not just primary schools. <sep><sep> This is how Sinndi and his disabled son ended up in the Timi-Balram family. <sep><sep> More recently, during a food crisis, we decided to set up a Food Security Front Commune. <sep><sep> It favors the oligarchy, a historical bourgeoisie by intervening less. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we attend the International Family Planning Summit, we face difficulties there, where are we going? <sep> H. said a defense against military violence in the Palestinian territories is a more realistic solution in today's context. <sep> After the death of this student, meaning another victim of sexual aggression in the world, everyone in the world has felt his suffering, representing the suffering of all women. <sep> Bobby Hureeram, MSM representative, has not spoken about how he has engaged himself politically. <sep> This crisis is leading to an increase in general insecurity. <sep> They find that "Yes, what Berenger is saying could be true". <sep> The Republican Movement did not come out victorious, but Rama Valayden became Minister of Justice. <sep> Therefore, it concludes that it is not normal for all Mauritians to be united in "Mauritianism", so we must work together in unity <sep> On 4 June 1990, Mauritius made a declaration and protested against this motion that Mauritius had deposited in the United Nations. <sep> When Carcassonne's report was criticized by almost all political forces (LALIT was the first to criticize this anti-democratic and fraudulent report), there was a second season where Ramgoolam used Sithanen as a negotiator to find a "consensus" on electoral reform. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Therefore, sometimes we use my voice as a weapon. <sep><sep> like my profession, will this not bring a single government for the whole world? <sep><sep> And after the meeting, we will have a little health drink, eat a snack to celebrate the end of the year together. <sep><sep> On September 7, 1991, instead of negotiating, the UK declared 200 miles of sea around Chagos as its exclusive maritime zone. <sep><sep> He knows because he has tried, together with his sailors, several times. <sep><sep> We have had to face repression, where these slide shows have been banned. <sep><sep> LALIT also supports soldiers and unionists who are suffering repression in various forms under the Ramgoolam regime. <sep><sep> There have been 6 times that the Supreme Court has had to intervene since 1968. <sep><sep> During the decade, Mayk explained our ways the colonizers are using all kinds of means to encourage them to abandon their cars. <sep><sep> And after that, there were 7 planned campaigns that Lalit is conducting further, with more details and discussions on how to transform the local economy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So they had a pretext for not implementing the mother tongue as the basis for learning in school. <sep><sep> In this historical block, there was a historical bourgeoisie section (Claude Lagesse, Didier Maingard, Sir Claude Noel, a goal in the Leclezio clan, the Gujadhur clan). <sep><sep> Such a society, they have somewhat corrupted transmission for certain sections in the detailed bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> It is the selfish interests of the bourgeoisie that are the biggest internal obstacles to the reunification of Mauritian territory, the return of Chagos, and dismantling the US military base on Diego, to initiate an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. <sep><sep> Almost every party has a program, even if often it is superficial, and even if often it is not practically implementable when the party comes to power. <sep><sep> But government after government has continued to impose a language policy dating back to the colonial era. <sep><sep> The crisis has shown us that the system itself is not good, it is a system based on profit-capital. <sep><sep> There is currently a pressing accusation in front of the International Court against the AGOA law (including its leadership on issues such as Diego) that Ram Seegobin presented in Los Angeles (see page 214). <sep><sep> - It truly represents large sugar cane planters without mules (through the Boolell, Osman, Bhoodoo, Deerpalsing, Gordon-Gentil families). <sep><sep> There are people who could tell you how they have been disappointed with politics because year after year, it becomes the same thing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT we have to face all kinds of external forces that bring mobilizations, once they are there, once they disappear. <sep> <sep> Give us the same organizational capacity needed to promote this program, promote this strategy. <sep> <sep> - A strategy for popularizing these demands, to act on the basis of these demands, so that the working class becomes empowered. <sep> <sep> First of all, it is not entirely different from what the previous government was doing. <sep> <sep> Before that, his relationship with people was a bit different. <sep> <sep> Moreover, throughout, there was enough food production on the island. <sep> <sep> Yes, it is true to say that a union, by its nature, needs an employer to negotiate. <sep> <sep> This ERA, one side of it is the way the Registrar regulates the functioning of unions. <sep> <sep> Jean-Claude Bibi highlights philosophical issues about this reflection. <sep> <sep> LALIT activist Ram Seegobin will be on the Finlay Salesse debate program on Radio One this Sunday at 12:15. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Not only does he not speak Chagosian when he takes the floor at the UN, but also refused to meet with the GRC since their visit in May, 2007.<sep> They have enacted the Employment Relations Act and the Employment Rights Act, two new laws that make it significantly easier for employers.<sep> For the first time this year, we have launched this project: conceptualize it, start doing it.<sep> The legal crisis has worsened especially with the phenomenon of casualization in employment where people are struggling without a fixed income.<sep> Meaning our program is more proactive than any political party, it analyzes reality as it is.<sep> Among the 6 billion people on the planet, a vast majority are living in very poor conditions.<sep> The political discourse of the colonial state and various regimes PTr-PMSD, MMM-MSM has maintained and hindered the development of literacy among most children, discouraging creative growth for all children, and marginalizing Creole literature.<sep> However this crisis has clearly awakened the majority of the population to think and follow up on reality.<sep> It has perpetuated a neo-colonial economic lie that depends on the markets of these countries for sectors such as Textiles, Sugar Industry, Tourism and BPO.<sep> In conclusion to all this, they say, "He has already alienated a portion of his country." <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Bizlall left the GWF and joined the FPBU, he focused entirely on trade union issues. <sep><sep> Men who were going to work on bicycles were not only getting under the house; the women who went to cut grass to feed the goats and cows felt tired just outside the house. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the Mauritian government publicly submitted a formal request for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Pelindaba Treaty: <sep><sep> Everyone is realizing the vulnerability of tourism that could collapse with things like an epidemic. <sep><sep> The Playgroup Federation has developed an extraordinary pedagogy in Kreol. <sep><sep> Another group of people will say, "No, it's not good for such reasons." <sep><sep> The more they can't pay, the more they will inevitably end up losing their homes and their land to foreclosure. <sep><sep> In order to end police violence, a much broader social struggle will have to be formed, to end inequality in access to means of survival in society. <sep><sep> Because when there is no political debate, when you really can't find what proposals you can make to your members in a political logic, you don't help your members find a reference; <sep><sep> So, people who have the same difficulty of language can respond in 2 different ways. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, when the Stalinist system collapsed, it was a capitalist mafia that was politically stronger than the working class in those countries. <sep> <sep> A person, an individual has not only his courage to work, he. <sep> <sep> Wise 2 CHILDREN The first year of marriage went without any big problems. <sep> <sep> So, this 30's aggressive propaganda, ideological propaganda, bourgeois. <sep> <sep> (Ram shows the book) This is also a size on which a lot of work has been done and today it has become a reality. <sep> <sep> Are you imagining in Mauritius, what needs to be done for his defense bars? <sep> <sep> We all know the amount of social problems that our society has. <sep> <sep> We have explained journalist to journalist, we have held press conferences, everyone LALIT, we know. <sep> <sep> And this transformation (together with the general secretary's quick and general raptisation) is known as a "historic bloc". <sep> <sep> A plan that will last from 2008 to 2028 to reduce energy production from carbon/fuel to 35% and increase renewable energy production (solar 15%, wind 6%, hydro 3%, wave 3%, co-generator 3% and Biomass (Bagasse) 35%). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you have a little less cash, you will go to a private doctor in a clinic, you are doing an illegal abortion, but in good condition nonetheless. <sep> <sep> When the government came with its project to abolish village councils and village elections, Lalit was the only party to campaign against this move. <sep> <sep> You will notice that Lalit activists are members of various trade unions, neighborhood associations that we are not seeking leadership but we want the working class organizations to be under the control of the working class so that the working class can take power unequivocally. <sep> <sep> Other Lalit members who took the floor were Alain Ah-Vee, Rajni Lallah, and Jean-Yves Dick. <sep> <sep> Lindsey Collen read this exact paragraph from his novel. <sep> <sep> No one can predict or foresee what will happen. <sep> <sep> It is not that you can form a union with 12 or 30 members, but it is fragmentation due to the nature of existing unions. <sep> <sep> In 1971, worker Anna invented a new system during the strike to share work, not the lathe system. <sep> <sep> there is a program that carries the same kind of work propaganda where there is Oodiah and L'Estrac. <sep> <sep> Every time they talk about "agricultural diversification", they quickly bring up a point where employers themselves want to bring it, that is, they say how Mauritian employers should invest in Madagascar or Mozambique, grow the food there. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Reports were coming in from all over the city about a rise in vandalism by young people. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we have already had a work session on John Bellamy Foster's book "Marx's Ecology". <sep><sep> This article aims to document the historical process of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace and its systematic sabotage by the Zini government. <sep><sep> When economic growth was strong in India and China, food prices precipitated a severe social crisis. <sep><sep> Furthermore, when they introduced pensions, they also targeted, and there was so much anger that arose against it that the Colonial Government introduced universal pensions. <sep><sep> We need to put enough pressure to prevent Israel from continuing its violations of international law and perpetrating a genocide in Palestine. <sep><sep> Also, it was hurting the creatures that had to dig long, deep canals to bring seawater to their villages. <sep><sep> Every minute of delay continues the linguistic genocide that we accuse the Government of committing. <sep><sep> Even the East seems to be awaiting the "Arab Spring", whether in North Africa or the Middle East. <sep><sep> Therefore, with the Government's support, they can make demands for compensation that represent a true reparation for the suffering they have endured due to this displacement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a lot of corruption and this corruption was representing a way to shift capital to individuals in the bourgeoisie class. <sep><sep> There needs to be a program to develop reflective capacity in every child; it depends on the introduction of the mother tongue as a means of education. <sep><sep> It is a crisis coming from a real despair that is present in the lower bourgeoisie amidst the systemic crisis impoverishing it. <sep><sep> For example, in the security industry, prices are falling, one after the other, by licensed, people by a thousand, by 15,000, by 20,000, will have to stop whining, artisans licensed by quantity. <sep><sep> Present were children that were learning to build paper boats instead. <sep><sep> In Forest-Side on November 9, 2005 there was a meeting in Forest-Side as part of the campaign for Alternative Economic Policy Strategies. <sep><sep> This recognition moment is a strong symptom that western hegemony is coming to an end after fifty-six years of domination over the entire world. <sep><sep> We found Gregoire's intervention, from the last 2-3 days when he returned to Mauritius, their interventions are going more towards this polarization, and it's very dangerous. <sep><sep> Workers in small businesses, almost half of the workforce in Mauritius with a drastic reduction of true employment in the country, are also very affected. <sep><sep> Even before the First Bidze Sithanen, we started a campaign. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are various household items that are already piling up in a family home, living in hiding. <sep><sep> It is not a small group of people deciding to go on strike. <sep><sep> There are people coming to seek legal advice: "Does he have the right to do that? Does the guard have the right to talk to me like that? <sep><sep> What looks like them all together - all these parts - is that they can be individuals with different colors, different symbols, but what looks like them is that they have the same kind of policy. <sep><sep> And if there were a world government, if it were a working class government, it would necessarily have to become a world government as well. <sep><sep> There must be pressure from the bourgeoisie so that there is a stronger government, either with a PT-MMM alliance, or a united national government with PT-MSM-PMSD-MMM. <sep><sep> Likewise, the route connecting the colony of Ariel to Tel Aviv. <sep><sep> There used to be The Sun newspaper, and Plitar Le Defi and even Radio Plus, but that has changed. <sep><sep> There are all kinds of organizations that gather people together. <sep><sep> So, for these reasons, why don't you find Lalit in Beau Bassin? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The newspaper is publishing all kinds of things, so the Prime Minister reacts by saying "this cannot be tolerated!" <sep><sep> There has been a series of sectors in Mauritius affected by this new crisis in the capitalist system: the tourism industry, for example, where the number of tourists has decreased significantly, even causing a drop in income, while the number of empty hotels has increased. <sep><sep> The capitalist production/distribution/financial machinery in 2011 went out of control. <sep><sep> Without realizing it, its operational base was almost entirely based on electoral fraud that was represented in parliament by the government. <sep><sep> Rampant consumerism, dirty politics, corruption and dominance were planting the seeds of chaos and causing a conflict behind the scenes. <sep><sep> Therefore, we have found that this legal system is one of the biggest intellectual frauds that society has created against the working classes. <sep><sep> Faced with a difficult situation, we must develop this conscious political struggle. <sep><sep> As a result, there have been attacks against the 2 members of the Family Relations Commission who are also members of the leadership of the Family Liberation Movement, and more attacks against other individuals on various issues, in the same bulletin. <sep><sep> Why, in the LALIT movement, have we adopted the concept of a "Historical Block" in our analysis? <sep><sep> and begin to plant 2 laliyn canes side by side (interweaving), creating a larger space. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 16th October 2011 - Mireille Martin resigns from the MSM to join the PTR and its Lalyans Lavenir. <sep><sep> For a long time, LALIT has rented a section of the LPT building in Grand River. <sep><sep> This is how she works a little everywhere in Europe and learns several languages. <sep><sep> Shanti was not feeling well because she had the flu but Devi came to her senses to be able to spend some time together with her cousins. <sep><sep> However, when there was resistance against CT Power in Pwento Kav, everyone seemed to have forgotten what was happening. <sep><sep> However, maybe before starting the debate, we should begin with clarifications or questions directly with the people who have prepared the papers. <sep><sep> It is important that friends understand a corner of the Advance Group so that they comprehend its program, its vision, and its sector, the interests of the class it represented. <sep><sep> And its results signify that, finally, it becomes affected similarly to the class which potentially could lead a true fight against communalism, the working class. <sep><sep> As well as, at the same time, to note the factors which have contributed preventing LALIT from developing more political weight. <sep><sep> But, for the first time now, there is something serious on their minds: "The after Berenger." This issue is constantly addressed in the press, favoring an MMM without Berenger. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is also an exhibition and promotional book tour on that island. <sep><sep> In the world, we must find ways to develop effective political solidarity that is not just symbolic, with the Palestinian people's struggle. <sep><sep> There are also quality genes that have become extinct before Homo Sapiens Sapiens, like ours. <sep><sep> Ian Jacob was selected by the Lalit Youth Group to attend the Intercontinental Youth Camp (IYC), which is part of the World Social Forum. <sep><sep> But, conversely, we have institutions like VoH, Voice of Hindu, which have been supported by Berenger and Navin Ramgoolam, to become what they have become. <sep><sep> Ganga and Devi avoided public beaches because on Sundays there would usually be crowds. <sep><sep> They could have presented themselves on their website, but they resigned. <sep><sep> Is "Wanted" a group that Nad Sivaramen believed was in the interest of his boss, the Pentagon? <sep><sep> In capitalist society, the courage to work is what each worker has, and what each capitalist buys. <sep><sep> In our club and association, we need to discuss issues, propose solutions, and organize petitions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When there is a shortage of forgiven flaws with the sword of law, the society brings problems of drugs, crime, domestic violence, rape, and other violence against women. <sep> The fact that i don't speak Arabic makes it difficult to communicate directly with about 25-39 year old women. <sep> And not all youths who commit relatively minor offenses (theft without violence, sex without consent). <sep> These are some signs of the crisis the trade unions movement is going through. <sep> Despite all the growth, it decreases every year, despite all the "resilience" that the Finance Ministry talks about, and despite the only way to say  "progress" is fake. <sep> There has been a resignation from the MSM in the government; a government that has been unstable since the results of the general elections of 2010. <sep> A court where a crisis has ended the hunger strike, and a court that has given satisfaction on almost every point. <sep> Section 2 has all kinds of different movements in different directions: acceleration in one direction, braking in another, steering wheel in another. <sep> In the conflict between the Alliance for the Future government and L'Express, LALIT positions itself in favor of press freedom. <sep> We need to, on a growth path, diversify, and do it in a planned and fast way. <sep>   <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will be a great boost to the learning of mother tongue and the acceleration of cultural literacy and writing from Ancient Africa since the Document of Timbuktu, and from Hieroglyphs. <sep> It has become a sign of an eminent civilization and even of the entire planet. <sep> The security industry has gone to Mozambique and Cote d'Ivoire, the French Zone of Madagascar and now of Lasinn. <sep> There was also a lot of voluntary work at that time, some in a "give and give" style. <sep> Even when most people describe evolution, even if they accept that it is the only scientific explanation for biodiversity, they will say things like: <sep> How many people have accused others of dying in another that is taking them to the hospital? <sep> It exists in a society that is divided by social classes, social classes with diverse interests, sometimes contradictory interests. <sep> * This process is irreversible because the plants will retain this genetic manipulation. <sep> Leaves on lone mangroves listen far on red honey cords with swords. <sep> So, how will we all analyze it, we must look into it through a historical lens. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Ministry of Finance is not making any further delays in proposing new production sectors that were ordered to be developed with this Rs7.3 billion, nor is it using this larger fund to prevent food insecurity. <sep><sep> In the past, there were primarily 2 types: an owner, and employees. Now, there are all kinds of contracts, part-time, owners, and others. <sep><sep> Wikipedia: Sustainable development is a socio-ecological process characterized by giving people what they need to live, and protecting the natural environment indefinitely. <sep><sep> - Why did the MSM-MMM-PMSD alliance vote for a repressive law called POTA, where human rights are not respected, where the police have all kinds of power to arbitrate? <sep><sep> An elite that was once racist in the beginning, it becomes communal afterwards and ultimately had a class connotation. <sep><sep> ii Petroleum crisis: stocks underground and underwater are constantly decreasing: the LALIT energy program, it shines and our program for an Alternative Economy. <sep><sep> In every neighborhood, there is crime, there is extreme violence. <sep><sep> I just have to believe that all organizations will agree right away, to say "This is a good program, we mobilize to take action". <sep><sep> After that, Ram Seegobin presented various options of LALIT. They use a nuclear energy metaphor, to show how the salted water escapes, enters the reactor, and the reaction continues onwards, a concatenation, but it forms its own strict structure. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And, meanwhile, what we are discussing today is that we have had a roaring labour movement reputation in most working-class parts - in almost every country. <sep><sep> Therefore, the propaganda and "communication" in the Creole and L'Estrac style are working on a certain level. <sep><sep> This may be one of the reasons for the fact that there was a very strong Communist Party in Bengal. <sep><sep> This is why we in Lalit are continuing our campaign to make the language that everyone understands, is used; in schools, in assemblies, in other instances and in all areas of public life to ensure broader democratic participation. <sep><sep> In the context of the economic and social crisis that Mauritius is going through, people are interested in our proposal for creating employment through developing food production based on industrial. <sep><sep> to make the government of Mauritius sign the Pelindaba Treaty to ensure inspections if there is no nuclear on a military basis in Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> Mauritius is also benefiting from British, European, and American investments when they seek to stabilize the country with investments (as they did in Hong Kong and Singapore). <sep><sep> This is how Berenger has been, is and will be successful. <sep><sep> But it is also important to keep an eye on exceptional creativity and innovation, which are often found in times of crisis. <sep><sep> We are making an international appeal, signed by a series of organizations in the world, for the Government of Mauritius to go to the UN for an inspection of the new Pelindaba Treaty on Diego Garcia. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There have also been major conflicts, such as conflicts between the Ramgoolam regime and the MSPA in 2007, major conflicts between the CEB and IPP establishments, between planters and sugar and molasses prices. <sep> <sep> Israel confiscates passports and identity documents at airport border controls and land borders with neighboring countries. <sep> <sep> It is interesting to note that Olivier Bancoult was in the official delegation of the Mauritian government at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa in January. <sep> <sep> He was also invited to Perth for a meeting with DSP members there and to discuss environmental issues to close the Diego Garcia base, during a screening of John Pilger's film "Stealing a Nation." <sep> <sep> They said that the true descendants of slaves in Mauritius are the working class. <sep> <sep> When I talk about political parties, I want us all to remember a basic issue. <sep> <sep> The Structural Adjustment Program was launched in the 1970s to kick-start the neoliberal operation that aims to privatize the Welfare State. <sep> <sep> This will give us an opportunity for truly high-level translation, and also allow many teachers and educators to immerse themselves in the process of writing a formal text in Mauritian Creole language. <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee already had a similar experience with the news media during the 2004 election. In 2004, Alain Ah-Vee approached two journalists from Le Mauricien for two separate interviews, in their offices, over a period of two weeks. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Are there other options for military recruiting? <sep><sep> It will be Wednesday, November 17 at 6:00 pm at GRNW in Orl Mama Bul Later LPT. <sep><sep> Assistance was provided by members and supporters of LPT, other associations, students, teachers from the University of Mauritius, and other Creole language supporters. <sep><sep> We need more participation from members and more involvement in writing, production, and distribution of the Review. <sep><sep> This is how when we study the economic system between analysis and history, it's already a term in our family. <sep><sep> So, a capitalist system, which must expand to satisfy its inner voracity for more investment, to sell more merchandise, it must, in a sense, feed itself immediately: <sep><sep> • Anyone elected may have the right to revoke and have permanent control over the Deputy, Ministers, and Prime Ministers: so that the electorate can revoke the deputy's election by electoral petition. <sep><sep> But, at the same time, we know that the electoral system, as it stands today, encourages this bipolarization between 2 blocks. <sep><sep> At Tel Aviv's Central Station, just to enter the platform to take the bus, I had to go through more than 100 soldiers. <sep><sep> If the offense is too serious to punish by a fine, the only punishment left in the law book is either imprisonment or forced labor in prison. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, they are implementing neo-liberalism, globalization, privatization, and a series of new anti-union laws. <sep><sep> The country's production of a large proportion of cereals in the world has been affected by floods and droughts, and this has further impacted production. <sep><sep> If we take the bourgeois class and its culture spread by the media as an example, it becomes more difficult to overturn its practices and its conception of everything, including the abstract and universal ideas it conveys in its content. <sep><sep> There are two irrational measures that could create jobs on a large scale and quickly, and for people looking for work: <sep><sep> 1 I will start by looking at this topic over time, in Mauritius. <sep><sep> We also need to come up with analytical tools to help us understand the processes that are operating behind all these series of political and social realities that Rada mentioned: <sep><sep> If you don't just want to observe history, but want to participate in changing it, don't hesitate to contact LALIT: by email at lalitmail@intnet.mu, by phone at 208 2132, or fill out this form and send it by letter to the Secretary, Lalit, Main Rd, GRNW, Port Louis, <sep><sep> It was almost the same color as Princess Prathna's dress, except that the princess's skirt was a little brighter. <sep><sep> Ministers A.Boolell and S.Mohamed publicly declared that the census should be based on communities (Mohamed even said that anything other than a new communal census is hypocritical). <sep><sep> The bourgeois economists, like Lutchmeenaraidoo in the Sunday newspaper, are almost entirely blaming the only problem. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kamini came to see him, he received her with shaking legs, almost fainting. <sep> Manyer Ashok Jugnath answered in Parliament, he made a plea for the youth. <sep> Tamby finished his studies and was living with Celine in a rented apartment, he promised his mother that she would meet his girlfriend. <sep> Then, after these major movements, they began to distance themselves, to separate instead of joining together. <sep> So today, 30 years later, we ask the question: "Where is the vanguard of 1979 today? <sep> There were movements for independence, workers' movements, and large demonstrations of popular resistance in 1937 and 1943. <sep> The olive branch in the North and the colony next to Eli were sacrificed for diamonds. <sep> We need a politics like LALIT politics, where we understand what we aim for, aiming together. <sep> In No Bases, they decided to hold the First Great International No Bases Conference there, as it seemed possible to help build a strong base there. <sep> The union movement, the economic and social crisis led to a decline in the union movement. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie imposes its dominance by determining which social services to provide because they believe they know the difficulties that workers face in their daily lives to survive in a capitalist system that exploits labor to maximize profits. <sep> Then they become a pawn to participate in the mockery of history as it unfolds before our eyes. <sep> The British government, as usual, behaved cynically when it was dealing with Mauritius' Independence. <sep> MMM is against the CT Power project on the pretext of defending the environment. <sep> In various villages, tribal parties have developed practices over time; customs and practices that have evolved through the years, are cultural norms in societies that, traditionally, are oral. <sep> But at that time, in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, people had already started to understand these big cities' differences. <sep> It constituted a different industry from the State. <sep> It is uncertain if it will take only a temporary solution to demobilize the large demonstration on Monday. <sep> These issues reflect the class consciousness. <sep> Soon, he realized that his wife had a point. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - Why are they trying to implement a new system where there will be regular salary reviews (PRB and NRB) for all workers in the public and private sectors? <sep><sep> Creole and Bhojpuri are among the "major" languages in the world, something that can be surprising. <sep><sep> And the analysis, it is good, not just for us to understand, but for us to act on this understanding. <sep><sep> LALIT believes in strengthening this political struggle, especially in the context of the economic crisis that is happening, we are already feeling the effects of this crisis in Mauritius. <sep><sep> "Laviktwar" has progressed with a great coalition - Sun Trust, the Labour government, Voice of Hindus, All Vaish Congress, and Mr. Somduth Dultamun and Mario Flore. <sep><sep> In the service sector, you can see that things have reached their limit with the drivers. <sep><sep> All this suggests that the time has come for us to shape our political destiny, to develop strategies that will stand against communalism, capitalism, and imperialism. <sep><sep> This will create two types of students in our schools. <sep><sep> In 1990, the MMM-MSM government managed to get the issue of Chagos on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, but they withdrew it after pressure from the UK-US regarding the sugar industry and textile quotas in the American market. <sep><sep> But the economic situation in the sugar industry and the French zone has prompted unions to take a defensive stance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have developed an ideological apparatus that was to make Goebbels (Minister of Nazi Propaganda in Hitler's Germany) proud. <sep> If the majority continues to think they are becoming new literacy animators and starting their propaganda campaigns at some events in Mauritius. <sep> We have engaged in a struggle for freedom, equality, ecology, women's liberation, and in fact we believe in humanity - because it is the mass of people who will bring about change. <sep> They have strengthened with the Zia-ul-Haq program to transform Pakistan, making it an "Islamic state". <sep> The media, be it the press, radio, TV, they make an incredible effort to present LALIT or LALIT militancy as "political observers". <sep> It's not the worker who enters management saying "How much will you pay me?" As an individual, you do not determine the price. <sep> For a solid foundation, for the reunification of the country, for complete decolonization of the Republic of Mauritius, and for reparations (Get the end of the book, in the historical document section, Rann Nu Diego Platform). <sep> The Bolivarian University academic book, which Yannick and Kisna's comrades have visited, says that if it were before 1998, they could not have gone to that university. <sep> For him to succeed, he often works closely with people in the Government. <sep> We need to address the demands that are closest to this issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, we have found a phenomenon of a union within several federations, but there are also many workers who are in 2, 3, 4, 5 unions. <sep><sep> In the past, we had contact with DSP, Lareunion, and Maron. <sep><sep> On the 4th, we put on linen and go into a field with a bottle, pants, a zip on it, and big shoes. <sep><sep> They share a very small house with several families, often sharing ownership. <sep><sep> Our question is whether the Catholic Church wants apartheid in the education system? <sep><sep> The reason given is that the interview contained opinions against the interests of L'Express. <sep><sep> Then, many people present have analyzed the seriousness of the crisis facing Mauritius and have begun to seek political solutions to oppose this form of economic control. <sep><sep> Following a series of attacks on workers, people are now miserly attacking pensioners. <sep><sep> And as we understand this dual nature, as well as this declining nature, the State, and the paradox that the State contains within, this allows us to contribute to influence: <sep><sep> When we say "different classes," what are we talking about? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With the introduction of new textbooks in Environmental Studies and Mathematics in Mauritian Creole, it is very possible to consider to keep existing textbooks. <sep><sep> He was a felon, a missing boy, a rebel. <sep><sep> But, there is a problem for this individual. <sep><sep> Minister Soodhun said "the police are not there to take care of people" <sep><sep> When they arrived in the neighborhood, all the noise disappeared. <sep><sep> In the space of 3-4 years, when economic crisis is hitting, the bourgeoisie is trying to reform MMM as a new party for themselves (the bourgeoisie) because the other two have been completely destroyed. <sep><sep> So, all this shows that the association between people and the concept of class struggle has been going on for a long time. <sep><sep> On the rooftop, in the hospital, at the post office, in the market, in the office, in court, on the beach, in the Justices' Court, in Mahebourg. <sep><sep> The newspaper Advance, which favored Independence, represented according to its Status a small-bourgeois (and bourgeois descended) Indo-Mauritian, and was more engrossed in front of a Workers' Party self-supporting, and closed. <sep><sep> It was a law that covered all unions, all workers, all employers in the management of the Awards. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - Objectively, he finds that he needs to choose between PT, MSM, and MMM. <sep> <sep> And today, as we are discussing action and methods of struggle, it is an opportunity to review the links that exist between our parties, our programs, our strategies, our actions and methods of struggle (which form part of our strategies, emanating from our program) to ensure that they are part of a "whole". <sep> <sep> This "anti-party" trend is gaining ground in the capitalist world. <sep> <sep> Regarding electoral fraud, when Ashok Jugnauth's seat was broken, logically there should have been a criminal prosecution against him. <sep> <sep> If he ever dies, they will give him a grand farewell, seeking another god. <sep> <sep> Then, Lindsey Collen presented proposals and an action plan that was initiated by the Lalit Education Commission in which 16-17 people participated in two recent meetings. <sep> <sep> and proposals by university students who were in attendance to help organize a film on the Birzeit University project in universities. <sep> <sep> A crisis in the financial sector sees all investors from other countries needing to return, where they are. <sep> <sep> There will also be a sculptor and his group of students who will work on a project. The opening will be an appointment between love and freedom. <sep> <sep> Cindy Clelie: Rajni Lallah will explain the preparation of the book, its content, and mention some of the demands and claims it contains. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> PMSD has been using violence in the municipalities it controlled to intimidate workers, market vendors, and physical attacks against activists. <sep> <sep> It is normal that all of us want our votes to be used for something constructive. <sep> <sep> In the beginning of his speech, Minis Sithanen said he was "accelerating public employment", but he is only taking in 2,600 people in the government, that's all. <sep> <sep> If he doesn't agree, he has no right to keep his monopoly on his land or on his capital. <sep> <sep> The international bourgeoisie is in league with the government to force many countries in the world to adopt a capitalist production system. <sep> <sep> This silence, the US Embassy has been trying to break it, through “making noise” in various civil society organizations that are possible. <sep> <sep> For the last few months of 2010, Restaurant Le Sapin has been organizing a festival where several artists come to play live music. <sep> <sep> At that time also, there were lots of, lots of advertisements in the newspapers. <sep> <sep> If we don't see the link between the economy and ecology, between environment and nature, we won't understand big things, nor will we be able to change big things. <sep> <sep> We find that this kind of strategy will advance the struggle for women's liberation further. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The old age pension system and the Village Council were introduced after the rebellions of 1937 and 1943. <sep><sep> Would they have been able to avoid accusations that they sided with the army against the rebellion? <sep><sep> Despite being a working class movement, trade union movement, and a party of the left like LALIT, they have led a long struggle against the IRA, the new law that is replacing it has come at a time when it is the employer who has more power to impose its agenda. <sep><sep> Where its strict film style, it represents a reflection on the passage of time, on absence, on destruction, on the search for the past. <sep><sep> This makes it his 4th base to drown, after Somalia (a failed state), Seychelles (where the US government panicked during the Lehmann crisis). <sep><sep> As Marx and Engels said, ideology is an inversion of the relation between consciousness and reality(2). <sep><sep> Technically it doesn't seem like a detention as they are lucky to check IDs. <sep><sep> The government had said that all municipal-village elections would take place in 2004. <sep><sep> If the government does not sit, it does not apply as it should, and it doesn't even have this accompanying money, the establishment wanted to turn workers against the government. <sep><sep> And when LALIT takes a stand, it comes out against LALIT and against a member, Lindsey Collen. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But why have both, that is, pro-targeting and anti-targeting organizations, entered into a single platform? <sep><sep> They rather see it as just a "cooperative movement", not as a political program. <sep><sep> - Never does any teacher have a problem because he speaks Mauritian Creole but because children in his classes speak Mauritian Creole. <sep><sep> But many people remember the repression against the unions that existed when the Blue-White-Red Alliance was there. <sep><sep> They do not write on the front or back of the golden leaf. <sep><sep> For GWF, there was Paul Berenger, there was Kader Bhayat and there was Ramsewak, who was president of GWF. <sep><sep> Lawyers, we say, should come together, behave together in the way they will act professionally when they find abuse, violence, beatings. <sep><sep> Then the Central Committee, and where possible a Full Members Assembly, adopts the Programme. <sep><sep> There is a bourgeois analyst who will not agree with this, who since 2001 they have been in total crisis. <sep><sep> Now let's look at the global results, and then in detail. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the importer arrived, a thousand people each took a sab. <sep><sep> Others spoke about the importance of branches, the LALIT Commission, all communication with a crowd, and the unique process of a Program like our LALIT Program. <sep><sep> They requested an export quota of 20,000 tons of fish. <sep><sep> At 1:00 in the morning, we got news that Mohammed had escaped and had reached his family. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, at the time (known as today), there were people who believed in material reality, but who were very mechanical in their materialism. <sep><sep> Crossing the river des Anguilles, Grand Bois, across the entire country, they do not make it obvious. <sep><sep> It rules the country like a ruler rules his subjects. <sep><sep> "You won't find it in the media," said Alain Ah-Vee. <sep><sep> The unions Laridon and Soodhun are entering this block. <sep><sep> We received support from various conflicting forces. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, during these same 3 years, the government's policy is to convert good agricultural land into industrial, commercial, IRS, ERS, and mall areas, accelerating. <sep><sep> Among the mills, there are some that produce electricity, some that produce ethanol, some that have refineries, some that have none. <sep><sep> Tai-Chi exhibition moving to duo by one of the biggest Tai-Chi masters in Mauritius, together with member Alain Ah-Vee, will become a master. <sep><sep> Today's global capitalist system is showing its failure as it has no solutions to the economic crisis and its economic system is part of the ecological crisis problem. <sep><sep> On the other hand, creativity is reduced to a mere merchandise. <sep><sep> That is why for a dozen individuals who are trying to create a "front" to gain "15,000 members", then they blatantly incite people to find out who the "thieves" are among them. <sep><sep> In their program, there were only two words: love and freedom. <sep><sep> For example, he said that the state actually recognizes a form of "family" where there is a "head of the family" who dominates the other family members, while in LALIT we see the family as a united group at a fire. <sep><sep> It was also noticed that 15 olive trees, strung from the Kafr Tappua colony, were set on fire last night. <sep><sep> In relation to another question, he said that Marx had a generalized conception of the importance of the link between nature and people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With this Pursewit also, it was only activated when Paul Berenger assumed the functions of Prime Minister. <sep><sep> All present expressed solidarity with the two new victims of police brutality, Jacques Achille, a journalist, and Kevin Beeharry, a minor. <sep><sep> So we find MMM in a terrible situation, since 1971 despite all the great speeches and leadership of MMM, socialism, nationalization of everything, when we look at its political practices, we find this confusion. <sep><sep> They are used to attacking Jeetah, David, Dullul, Valayden, who are somewhat like "the boy scouts" among the Ministers. <sep><sep> The workers there have organized themselves to work as a collective, instead of an individual tin. They made a big tin. <sep><sep> Not only J.C. de l'Estrac, but also Arianne Cavallo-l'Estrac, she also does this propaganda. <sep><sep> I suppose they drink tea, but I do not know what they discussed. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen continued, saying that this other, John Bellamy Foster, when he hears such things, because he knows Marx, he knew all that strength, and finally he wanted to answer. <sep><sep> Today he is active in the women's organization in Salfit. <sep><sep> What Minister Sithanen wanted to do was to pay 100% tax for all parents who receive social security either old age pensions or disabled or all those who earn less than Rs7,500 per month. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As you know, this type of Lacor is defined not only as a cadre in which American officials can circulate and operate freely in other countries. <sep> <sep> Timi remembers well that it was once a peddler when he was circulating in his sale. <sep> <sep> As we say in LALIT, this, like the approach to Block 104, is equivalent to a demand for a 5th community. <sep> <sep> The strong reaction was giving people shame. <sep> <sep> And there is also a facial feature that a political party presents. <sep> <sep> * DPP Area: Successfully prosecuted against 4 guards under the new torture law, in the case of Mr. <sep> <sep> As I said, we have had a commitment since FTU, while the Federation, as their respective affiliates, is providing support if the strike goes further. <sep> <sep> If there is no strike, everyone will know in January 2013. <sep> <sep> The only force that agreed to work with them was the religious parties. <sep> <sep> Studies have concluded that a significant number of Zambian children (all educated in English) have extremely strong math skills but zero reading competencies in 2 languages. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Only after I understood what Zezi said because I was able to read it in French and English. <sep><sep> - Also published in Creole: J.Marie Richard (ZM Edition), P.Lallah Editions Playgroup and LPT Books). <sep><sep> It certainly will not be based on a common rural or racial rhythm. <sep><sep> Many similar authorities have been built, before trying to carry out such a complicated grievance. <sep><sep> Before launching "Dayri Palestin", there was a photo exhibition by Garo Nalbandian showing a facet of life in Jerusalem, Palestine, which is rarely found by us. <sep><sep> LALIT will have a great program, helping us by developing a new computer program for our documentation. <sep><sep> We are saying that Ramgoolam and Boolell should immediately instruct Milan Meetarbhan, representative of Mauritius in UNASUR, to introduce a resolution at the UN General Assembly 2013 to bring the case before the ICJ. <sep><sep> Norman Mineta, Transport Secretary: has connections with Lockhead Martin (a large company producing arms), Boeing. <sep><sep> We condemn the government for neglecting the serious problems and precariousness of the population in a concrete way, rather than resorting to repression and reducing the rights that workers have today. <sep><sep> In my opinion, in a 27-paragraph report, there are 11 paragraphs attacking Lalit and LPT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> With various NGOs (including Soroptimist, Right Now, Amnesty, PILS, Arc en Ciel, Justice and Peace, MPRB, LPT, and others), especially on the National Human Rights Committee bankruptcy. <sep> When there is a singular revolutionary, conscious, possibly international, working class against bourgeois class, meaning capitalism, it is like a tsunami. <sep> The two vanguard forces of the working class, which have been forming for 10 years in a series of struggles, and which have developed an organic link with the Lalit de Klas, and which have accelerated its development during the strike. <sep> Hence the media has defined a reality where corruption seems inevitable for every election in the context of their vote. <sep> Here, the quality analysis that he and Friedrich Engels began to develop. <sep> He warned everyone: "For me, it is extremely disturbing that in a moderately developed country like Mauritius that hopes to become the 'Singapore of the Indian Ocean' with an increase in food prices, the population is eating less." <sep> They say unions must do union work, and even more so ask direct questions. <sep> And in this typographical case, in fact, finally, technology has ended in error on labor. <sep> There was an "image" that Ram Seegobin used that people were very pleased with: a machine like a truck. <sep> The ceremony took place in the new "documentation space" that was created. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Artisans of Medine can join 3 recognized unions. <sep><sep> But, what Bidze did not say which is sometimes more troubling: It does not make it clear how in one billion Food Security Fund has been spent, on what, and what remains. <sep><sep> In this Communication, Lalit also deplores the fact that the Prime Minister has not responded to Lalit's letter, nor, as far as we know, studied our proposals for a level playing field. <sep><sep> And we have made a vow that we will continue until we succeed. <sep><sep> But he explained that by excluding luxury items and non-food products, it means that in the year 2011, there was a food importation (net, not gross) of Rs18 billion. <sep><sep> While Minister Sithanen praises Bill Gates products from Microsoft, we do not find this appropriate at all in a Bidze speech. <sep><sep> We are talking about when basic commodities will be sold, merchandise. <sep><sep> 2 democratic years developing towards a federation form? <sep><sep> It would have been better to remember a Production Form III. <sep><sep> (Laughter.) We, we believe there is a big accounting trick in this Bidze. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> The text in English is as follows:

<sep> CSR committees that include NGOs, government representatives, and private sector are withdrawing responsibility from the government to provide social services such as the right and are going to private sector to ask for favors.
<sep><sep> There are 2 ways to interpret this difficulty.
<sep><sep> But it's through Best Loser that Collendavelloo is saying watch out for what has happened!
<sep><sep> It's a lesson that we should not believe, and we have never believed that we can have a mini-socialism in the Indian Ocean, when in fact the world is dominated by a totally ruthless neo-liberalism.
<sep><sep> However, just 2 weeks later, Berenger says the best loser has exceeded, it must disappear.
<sep><sep> If the resigners start an organization then we will treat the organization as an organization.
<sep><sep> Our team was at 7 because he is a violator colony enough.
<sep><sep> We need six weeks to do this kind of medical procedure.
<sep><sep> Can take a mile, but it's an example.
<sep><sep> street language, bad French, corrupt French, bad English, a patois, everything except a language. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It means losing his job, losing his savings, he may even lose his job. <sep> <sep> Part of Diego Garcia must be dedicated to a Non-Military Tsunami Warning Station for the Indian Ocean region. <sep> <sep> The government has made an appeal to the public and reasonably the electorate. <sep> <sep> The experiences of the Commun de Paris and the analysis of Marx on it have refined its understanding of how a revolution can take place in practice. <sep> <sep> And not just there, but here in Mauritius, everyone was supposed to flow, without any real direction, wandering. <sep> <sep> But the system in which we live, where a small capitalist group believes and acts in a way that they alone make decisions for everyone. <sep> <sep> Solidarity Tent in Az Zawiya is an attachment to the priests and brothers (only priests are present) and sessions for residents passing through for a moment under the tent. <sep> <sep> Palestine has finally gained recognition as an Observer State in the United Nations. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, as it is now, we almost have a government for the whole world. <sep> <sep> In a press conference on Wednesday, October 13, Education for Workers launched the first publication in a new series called FOOD FOR THOUGHT. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We had a lot of participation in the demonstration in front of the French Embassy. <sep><sep> Our first part which was presented a report and a program. <sep><sep> No Concert which has injured 33 people. <sep><sep> But his paternal grandfather insisted on calling him Shakti Devi. <sep><sep> In society, he has punishment in this kind of speed. <sep><sep> Whenever the rain falls, the river turns red with the earth that the water drags, go into the sea. <sep><sep> The influence of the fourth on the press, it is parallel with the first and second, concerning the press in the article where international. <sep><sep> The program we need, it will only be answered by the seriousness of the crisis if it is based on a class struggle. <sep><sep> Everyone was invited, his life like his youth, his lady like his sir. <sep><sep> * Differences in the amount of money everyone possesses, that is when inequalities begin. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the other hand, the balance of power in society is less fair now than in 2000. <sep><sep> Other important embassies, such as France, India, China, are also putting pressure to break alliances. <sep><sep> This is due to population density, epidemics, climate disturbances. <sep><sep> This has been contributed by Lindsey, Rajni, Alain, Jean, Cindy, Rada, Ram. <sep><sep> Starting from RA, they support him saying he is not just a member. <sep><sep> Before going further, let us do a retrospective, in chronological order, on what happened in these past weeks: <sep><sep> Indeed, these two months, they were on the minds of everyone who was reflecting on a solution. <sep><sep> But we had an official meeting with our Deputy, Hon Collendavello, Hon. <sep><sep> For a good while now, since the electoral campaign period, Lalit has been raising concerns about the upcoming economic crisis. <sep><sep> Internal conflict at the CNT, where the Manager was against the Chairman, meaning Soonarane against Dhookun, 2 pro-workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He determines what nature the work contract is. <sep><sep> Today these parties have become representatives of the interests of different bourgeois sections. <sep><sep> Since the Election, whether it is about the Chagos issue, the mother tongue issue, the electoral reform issue, it is LALIT that has really emerged as a true political opposition force. <sep><sep> Employers are starting to put pressure on the government to import foreign workers. <sep><sep> and the American Empire wants to control oil supplies after the Second World War (1939-45). <sep><sep> But today to go out to rally, there are closures, you can lose everything, you can lose your livelihood, you can lose all your belongings. <sep><sep> The introduction of Creole can benefit children in their apprenticeship in other dimensions and can help improve the level of education in primary schools. <sep><sep> Coming from Paris, an episode in history that schools do not teach, it is one of its pretexts. <sep><sep> When it comes to electronics and textiles, our production system is in crisis. <sep><sep> This monopoly exists as if there is no democratic control over it - except in cases of extreme boycott movements from the masses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For the Palestinians olive peace, it is an important step, but it is more. <sep><sep> And it was very universal on Dr. Cure, Anquetil, Rozemont. And then, PTr evolved. <sep><sep> A development dispute has been going on since Jean Claude de l'Estrac from L'Express supported by Malenn Oodiah. <sep><sep> Ashok Subron and five others resigned on the 13th of Ziyet, and others resigned after that. <sep><sep> * Thus Pravind Jugnauth admits that there is a big problem among us, and he has no policy to alleviate it, nor any protection for workers (even in his 8 obligations which he cited in the beginning of his speech). <sep><sep> Often an electoral program that has an expiration date, meaning it expires after 5 years or before 5 years depending on whether the government goes or not. <sep><sep> The court is just a front because the State of Israel has decided. <sep><sep> Indeed ¾ of these lands are being used for production and production of carbide from May. <sep><sep> This new series, as its title suggests, will cover matters for everyone in Mauritius and everyone in Rodrigues to reflect on all important issues. <sep><sep> The question of poverty I would have liked to take an example on our program on the unemployment that has been currently active. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, those people in the working class, and also at the same time in a separate process separated entirely from their class when they found that the moment had come, they wanted to kiss. <sep><sep> He said how that day went, he came out of his beautiful car, he entered the house and then found his girlfriend welcoming them in the living room. <sep><sep> Here in Mauritius, all the people who came clearly concerned by this, but we are working here, but we made sure that we have militant comrades fighting in Australia, in Iceland, in France, in America, around, in Paris. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy took the floor for 5 minutes, and her interpreter, Hikaru Kasahara, interpreted for 5 minutes. <sep><sep> And at the same time, the representation of the youth solidarity group in the central committee became very symbolic, there were no female representatives anymore, as there should have been, and where boys had two members of the youth group coming alternately. <sep><sep> Rajni Lallah then explained how in 1983, in that same last general election where Paul Berenger presented himself as the Prime Minister of the MMM, at that time, the MMM said in its governmental program that the first session was in Parliament. <sep><sep> Among its members, there are 2, who are PRO establishments of the security industry. <sep><sep> We don't want them to come and take our metadata. <sep><sep> These conferences and so-called "strategies" have further strengthened us in the last 2-3 years. <sep><sep> • Reunification of Mauritius, including the Chagos archipelago (the issue of sovereignty) <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, 2 deputies, Mireille Martin and Jim Seetaram resigned from the MSM and joined the PT/PMSD alliance that continues to be supported by a slim majority. <sep><sep> In terms of international reviews, who receives the highest acclaim for their artistic work? <sep><sep> Is it possible for there to be a class worker power struggle solely through elections? <sep><sep> There is a Palestinian activist who has gone to seek refuge in France and Canada to target certain companies that support Zionist settlements in occupied territories. <sep><sep> In all the prisons, there are negotiations with the Israeli Prison Authority. <sep><sep> He wanted to provide his estate with a lot of comfort, a car, and an apartment in the luxurious area but Ganga refused because there was a limit that could not be exceeded. <sep><sep> Everyone is embracing nationalism, everyone is seeking a nationalist leader. <sep><sep> Everyone is betraying their comrades. And this is absolutely true. <sep><sep> In recent years, countries like Lin and Pakistan have also started developing their own nuclear weapons. <sep><sep> What has happened in Sri Lanka has become an 'internal' issue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In his speech, he highlighted the importance of UNESCO, on one hand, and his own life experiences, on the other. <sep><sep> Tonight he decided to have a divine drink. <sep><sep> But the rumor was circulating that transactions were taking place in the Grangob-Bonnvenn district. <sep><sep> They were renting rooms in a family pension in a region where even the secret police of Samazeste were hesitant to enter. <sep><sep> The members of LALIT Assembly have decided to meet on Sunday, 4th April to discuss the political situation after Navin Ramgoolam announced the dissolution of Parliament, the election date set for 5th May, and Nomination Day on 17th April. <sep><sep> Maldives recognizes our sovereign rights to exercise on our territory. <sep><sep> Thus, in the face of violence between communities organized by the State, the State must reestablish its authority. <sep><sep> He said that the political base of the "Muslim League" was mainly large landowners in the regions that became Pakistan. <sep><sep> During the press conference when we did the draw, the letter that all Lalit candidates addressed to the Electoral Supervisory Commission was presented. <sep><sep> In Lalit we believe that every language has the right to flourish. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Commentator: Comrade Reeaz: I wanted to share a major interrogation that we, together with the union, heard yesterday. <sep><sep> They put the focus on WHO figures indicating that there have been 100,000 deaths in the Iraq war, a figure that official media outlets do not emphasize too much. <sep><sep> I have not found any soldiers or colonels on patrol. <sep><sep> Racist organizations are emerging at locations to incite violence and push the country towards generalized hatred. <sep><sep> Additionally, they started to distribute products from other plantations to secretly provide support. <sep><sep> At the beginning, the large class force between Paloma and Diego is challenged by a glance. <sep><sep> Mainly, it needed to swallow a fish hook in its stomach. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the Seychelles government, in the meantime, has successfully completed its territorial decolonization, achieved its reunification, and has managed to recover its islands from the British Indian Ocean Territories (BIOT). <sep><sep> But the results of the latest municipal elections show that the FSM has not strengthened, there are still enough votes in certain wards. <sep><sep> Many people must organize together, agree, and then work towards changing the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These are the things we need to be very vigilant about, we need to denounce. <sep><sep> The Lakaz movement, for example, organizes people without a home to make demands, petition, and protest. <sep><sep> We are in a "downturn", a time of demobilization and depression among the working class. <sep><sep> Present for Lalit: Ally Hossenbokus, Pascale Mavisa, Andre Pierre, Alain Ah-Vee, Ram Seegobin, Rada Kistnasamy, Lindsey Collen, Rajni Lallah. <sep><sep> In Italy, even a businessman, owner of a media company, Berlusconi, becomes powerful in politics, where the intertwining of politics and media becomes one. <sep><sep> France and its East India Company has taken the land that is today Mauritius, and when the French Revolution ends with the system of feudal lords in France, there is also a great conflict in Mauritius, between different classes. Later, the British government battles the French government and removes it from its sugar-robbed island. <sep><sep> The Supreme Court may issue an injunction that turns a legal strike into an illegal one. <sep><sep> Thus, this systemic crisis is partly explained by the way the Prime Minister is turning towards dictatorship. <sep><sep> There are links like the Communist Party of Cuba, the Communist Party of Vietnam, the Socialist Party of Venezuela (United Socialist Party of Venezuela - PSUV) and other similar parties in countries close like New Zealand or far like America. <sep><sep> Professor Mike Cole, in his speech, has distinguished Marxist pedagogy, responded to Post-Modernist, Post-Structuralist, Trans-Culturalist analyses on "education", and also responded to new trends such as the "Critical Race Theory" movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The number of incidents of violence against detainees by the police or prison guards has increased. <sep><sep> We demand to be included in this fight to improve free services on the Welfare State; to ensure a solid society that takes care of everyone. <sep><sep> Many private sector employers prevent their employees from engaging in political activities. <sep><sep> There is a conflict among what we call "law practitioners", those who practice law, there is a conflict that has arisen and still exists today, among lawyers, among certain minority Ziz, who contest the legitimacy that the law believes it has. <sep><sep> We are pleased with the first reason the government gave: The project aims at the installation of a closed circuit system in the Port Louis area with the following objectives: <sep><sep> It is a longitudinal study over a period of 8 years, between 1983 and 1991. <sep><sep> This is to prevent problems affecting society from becoming demands of communal-religious groups and other NGOs financed by employers. <sep><sep> In the village of Hares Samdi, Israel through its army has provided 7 families with papers to present to the court if they decide to contest the rent increase to break their homes. <sep><sep> Thirdly, in this election, Cehl Meeah won with 292 votes. <sep><sep> On the other hand, since Bérenger was Minister of Finance in 1982, he has clearly stated that he, MMM, supports the "healthy management of the economy". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During a public event, Lindsey's friend also, publicly denounced Jack Bizlall and provided references for people to go read for themselves the content of his verbal sexual aggression. <sep> <sep> The violence hybrid in the life of the old man, it was a guarantee that his upbringing was present. <sep> <sep> When the establishments Mon Loisir, Mon Tresor and Riche-en-Eau were formally asked to close. <sep> <sep> In his case at the Intermediate Court, two Magistrates found that this case was, "concocted", meaning, fabricated entirely. <sep> <sep> It was here that a British/Mauritian Fisheries Commission was set up, which took place on 27 January 1994. <sep> <sep> Just being active, whether just holding a demonstration, does not mean that you are participating in a class struggle that will bring about progress. <sep> <sep> However, it is interesting when we analyze the role of the "independent press", in this article today, to be reminded that at that time the Director of Le Militant was Jean Claude de L'Estrac. <sep> <sep> This program, in turn, further encourages more women, joining Lalit. <sep> <sep> They call it "Intellectual Property Rights" or "Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights" (TRIPS). <sep> <sep> Regarding the establishment, it only uses its new land (once every 7 years) to enter and plant it, meaning that where there are exhausted lands after 6 years, 2 other lands are too costly and when more lands are required, it becomes a plantation of imports. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is something happening all over the world, and also in Mauritius. <sep><sep> However, there is a magazine with Mrs. Navarre-Marie (former Minister of MMM Dharza Fam and Zanfan) and Yves Giraud, President of APEIM (Association of Parents of Disabled Children). <sep><sep> Neither for the people of Mauritius, nor for the inhabitants of the BIOT territories. <sep><sep> Economic and political leaders were deeply involved in this full-fledged meeting. <sep><sep> But, a Constitution is never just a matter written and drafted by a person. <sep><sep> When the authorities will finally decide to change the education system to promote mother tongue literacy, in the vernacular languages of the country, such as Creole and Bhojpuri. <sep><sep> And finally, the family is happy that you are united and ready to act according to your political beliefs. <sep><sep> It does not have the same meaning as the press gives to this sentence. <sep><sep> Bush was supposed to come to Mauritius for the AGOA Forum. <sep><sep> -Jubilee South, CADTM - King of the World, also against financial capital, but in a different way-NGO. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Who introduced this measure that they're implementing on the streets? <sep> <sep> LALIT, on its part, in the 2 elections it contested, continued all these actions. <sep> <sep> And in this, we have to acknowledge that in order to build something new, we must avoid this type of method. <sep> <sep> In 'Tapaz', constantly, we get an impression of these less clear elements that make up life: children cry for things that they often don't understand. <sep> <sep> Its useful value (called "use value" in English) is important. <sep> <sep> And the work that LALIT has organized in DIEGO has truly been a good moment not just for that reason. <sep> <sep> The biggest mobilization recently, it has been against this bourgeoisie that finds itself stuck. <sep> <sep> Good job sorting through it all, send it to Lil Galimacha. <sep> <sep> We need to mobilize so that the government does not yield to the various lobby groups of the bourgeoisie who want to control energy production and continue to profit from people's hardship. <sep> <sep> And when the food crisis starts to worsen, the Mauritian Government will not have made any real provisions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The public servant also called to give their point of view. <sep><sep> G. Duval did not agree with Xavier returning to the MSM-RMM government. <sep><sep> His lawyer, Mr. Rex Stephen, will provide explanations on all the legal steps taken. <sep><sep> LALIT, at this moment, is in a position to defend its rights, increasing its ability to intervene in political matters. <sep><sep> Guard the data on him closely to gain access to the data. <sep><sep> After the conference, there will be a screening of the film "Affaire Kaya" by Michel Villermet. <sep><sep> However, for 5-6 years now, this type of bureaucrat has been holding hands with SILU, or SILU moving away, particularly GWF moving away. <sep><sep> We are not strict enough in the licenses, we are not strict enough part by part - we have some, but not enough. <sep><sep> However, a new morality has not yet emerged (it will emerge during a struggle for a new society). <sep><sep> Members need to be told not to mix masks with alcohol. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He also spoke about the bureaucratization of his union in terms of encountering democracy within the union: meaning that union members lose power in relation to the leaders. <sep><sep> And if we look at the new sectors that have developed under this "democratization of the economy," we have more SMEs that are more ideological than economic. <sep><sep> In October 2008, the Free Gaza Movement in coordination with ISM activists, organized a boat trip where they managed to break the siege on Gaza and enter Gaza. <sep><sep> All Mauritians who watch the television news or listen to the radio, to be able to hear Bidze in Mauritian Creole to mark this first day when this Constitutional amendment was reviewed. <sep><sep> Then Yvan Marshal started to investigate interesting matters, as he usually does in his column "Il y a 25 ans". <sep><sep> And if the employer refuses, then the State must expropriate him, thereby ending his monopoly on the means of livelihood. <sep><sep> In short, history is drawing its conclusions against this conspiracy to commit a crime against humanity in secret. <sep><sep> So the police took him to the Civil Hospital for treatment and to pass through the necessary procedures, before returning him to prison together with other detainees, which led to the closure of Layn Baraks. <sep><sep> Since then, we have been resisting against the IMF-World Bank, against privatization, and during this AWC period, we have halted the bourgeois party's program for privatizing the port. <sep><sep> Towards the end of last year, during a meeting one day, Ashok Subron announced that our time is coming, and we are preparing for a series of activities, that are not limited to only that day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MLF conducted a series of meetings concerning the economic crisis with family members who have lost their jobs individually, outside and within the MLF, as well as the Family Association. <sep><sep> It is still true that identity, organization, and solidarity based on communal-racial grounds are dangerous. <sep><sep> Let us look at how big landowners determine their ideology. <sep><sep> He grew up in France. <sep><sep> LALIT supports the demand for an increase in wages in the transport sector. <sep><sep> Some men were grumbling, eating their own words, but soon they were finding comfort in clubs and bars. <sep><sep> We urge the Mauritian Government that on 2 April it sent a Note Verbale to the British government, recalled the Mauritian O-Commissioner in London for consultation, and decided to register a protest with the UN Secretary-General. <sep><sep> However, in the meantime, the management of Air Mauritius, those who awarded themselves huge bonuses, have gone and made an absolutely monumental mess. <sep><sep> Our activists have also been involved in the work and actions of other associations, including the MLF and LPT. <sep><sep> On the other hand, the Employment Relations Act (2008) replaces the Industrial Relations Act (1973). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The General Workers Federation (GWF) states that the fundamental right is non-negotiable and should not be deviated by the discussions of a "tripartite" body. <sep> <sep> So when Commissioner Lerop Ini proposed a 37% reduction in the price of diesel over the next 2 years, it was totally unexpected. <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who co-chaired yesterday's launch of the LALIT platform, explained how the State of Israel is continuing military occupation with the imperialist support of the US and Lerop. <sep> <sep> This is because one needs to make enough noise to prove in front of the authorities that they deserve this pension. <sep> <sep> If today the question of Chagos and Diego Garcia base is still occupying international attention, it is not entirely by chance. <sep> <sep> So, this strong conception is causing workers to be politically conscious in general. <sep> <sep> Even this afternoon, we shared ideas in all regions where we have branches. <sep> <sep> At the same time, crises continue in other major sectors, such as tourism, construction, and ICT/BPO. <sep> <sep> Perestroika (a challenge to reinstall capitalism, with a policy of strengthening derived from external capitalism) has been brought about by glasnost (a challenge to bring socialism with freedom for the working class). <sep> <sep> Never in the history of humanity has there been such a detour. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In these societies, they have not really evolved much. <sep> <sep> We were mobilizing against a boss who wanted to profit at all costs. <sep> <sep> Even yesterday, Report Back also had a mini-exhibition on their visit, with several copies of the newspaper "Direct Action," a newspaper that is not only unique in its pulling but also a free and open tribune, for members to read. <sep> <sep> Before they were either suppliers or clients with whom he needed to maintain good relations because of his work. <sep> <sep> Out of the 1,100 existing companies in Mauritius, we feel we are winning. <sep> <sep> It is not a program that paid off in 1917, 1944, or even today. <sep> <sep> The first victory, when we speak of "citizenship," in the social and political sense, it may be better to go through the different sources that are there. <sep> <sep> Because if we pay the worker his fair value, he will have nothing, nothing more, for him after he has compensated the worker. <sep> <sep> The second difficulty in starting the electoral reform debate, what every government has used as a pretext to make a series of constitutional sanctions in the interests of prolonging their party's comfortable terms. <sep> <sep> In fact, there has been significant intervention since M. Descubes and Lindsey Collen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The PT is taking advantage of the economic crisis situation to open up possibilities for the development of the bourgeois state. <sep> In conclusion, we would like to say that, the Frenchman, we are a little alarmed to find a union party supporting the government of Navin Ramgoolam, and a party giving a sermon to the Paul Bérenger opposition. <sep> it should also be noted that “The Prime Minister has declared that he considers the Bestloser system to be well named, but no longer useful today”. <sep> This means attacking a system where a man is given power over all women and the majority of men. <sep> this is how the bourgeois pay attention to only “extreme poverty” rather than social inequality and economic power concentration. <sep> Then a mischievous smile decorated his lips. <sep> And so, according to bourgeois ideology, we must continue like this, from the time of the first stone to the time of the diamond! <sep> The quality of the question reflects that no one in Madagascar has a theoretical and academic knowledge well ahead. <sep> How do you get an understanding between all people in a major movement of revolt like in the UT 79. <sep> This dictator of a small numerical class, which we have described here, on a large majority of people in society, it is possible because of an imaginary concept called “State”. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At the same time, we ask to convert all the old windmills in the region into food production, especially for export. <sep> We can say that Lalit has always kept the flame of the struggle for Diego Garcia alive. <sep> We must therefore force our government to stop its criminal policies on the Chagos issue. <sep> First of all, it must be stressed that the resignations were not indefinite. <sep> A third paper will focus on such a vital issue, namely the conflict between energy production, a sustainable lifestyle, workers' rights, and organization. <sep> The launch of workers' organizations in Mauritius, within the All Workers Conference, also adopted Lalit's demands in 1998. <sep> - So they say, to genuinely influence the major political parties or the government between elections, you must organize within NGOs, trade unions, civil society - not politically. <sep> What kind of society forces a woman and an elderly person with a check to descend from a vehicle and walk through foot control? <sep> She was filling her basket with fruits in the forest to satisfy her hunger, but she was maintaining her botanical garden like a mother who takes care of her child. <sep> But now, for the MMM, it's Navin Ramgoolam who is responsible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, it is advisable to tell us exactly what we want to control, or what rights to return like we ask the reason for which there is this problem. <sep><sep> Can we contribute regionally and regionally in the future? <sep><sep> Today, the results of these different mobilizations have made the government realize that it is necessary to focus on social justice, regulate land ownership, and facilitate people to build their own homes. <sep><sep> It will be interesting to follow the entire electoral process, the campaigns at the village/city level, and the significant regional mobilization for the General and Presidential Elections, scheduled to take place in principle in January and February 2005. <sep><sep> The LALIT Assembly LALIT Militants LALIT attended the Assembly convened on December 16, 2012. <sep><sep> After everyone's testimony, there were questions, and then discussions where people started analyzing the strategies and tactics that seem to improve "working life". <sep><sep> As for Palestine, there have been significant developments at this crucial point where Palestinian authorities have submitted a motion to the UN for acceptance of the Palestinian State Membership. <sep><sep> The government has built many JSS schools, Providence schools, and has made schooling compulsory up to 16 years old. <sep><sep> Bharat Bhomatom detested differences; he was at a loss when he heard that there were two Bacharas who thought there was another way to live life. <sep><sep> The program was on the resignation of Guimbeau and his integration into the PMSD in municipal elections. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, with regards to wages, despite the reforms that were supposed to bring improvements, it is a law that undermines workers' rights. <sep><sep> So, it's time for us to start listening carefully to what the Workers say when they talk about economic democratization before they vote. <sep><sep> We have been conducting analysis and surveys every year. <sep><sep> Here are LALIT's proposals: Increase the number of deputies, given that the population has doubled since 1968, to facilitate a transition from a non-communal system and also increase the weight of elected representatives vis-a-vis the Cabinet. <sep><sep> They know that the working class in Mauritius will not vote for a party that favors capitalists. <sep><sep> Because pro-capitalist parties like MMM, PT, and MSM dominate the political landscape in the country today, they will be stronger in the trade unions as well. <sep><sep> Thus, class struggle is never something that hinders progress, as is often portrayed. <sep><sep> Today, as Mauritius celebrates its 40th Independence Day, it is also an opportunity to reflect. <sep><sep> All that is not within these two alliances is treated as if it were a party without a program and without a history. <sep><sep> The more freedom you can gain in life, the more freedom you have to participate in a degrowth movement, and we have gained more freedom in one that has been named, one that has been on the rise for the past 3 weeks. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Kiba, in a certain sense, is an example for us. <sep><sep> However, there is a certain mobilization, even if this mobilization merges into the CNT, a certain number of transport workers rediscover this link, the transport and LALIT sector. <sep><sep> He explained how there are three types of Bhojpuri: there is the original Bhojpuri as his grandparents used to speak, there is the creolized version, there is the one influenced by Bollywood style. <sep><sep> I suppose it is precisely this "dirty threat" which is tearing apart the occupation. <sep><sep> What is new are new sectors that have developed: such as ITC, BPO services, the Finance sector, which have very difficult working conditions, on the one hand, and which are often dependent on imperialism. <sep><sep> And when Menwar's tabla and instruments accompany dancers Anna Patten and Grenouille, there too, we find and hear new things, interesting things. <sep><sep> It is true that we rely on it, in a way, to live. <sep><sep> There are pictures of his skin with those scar marks. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, it was said that rice and split peas could feed up to 15-20 people, and now it has changed to rice and dipin. <sep><sep> Remember that Kaya was arrested 2 days after a Valayden concert, and after that Kaya had no injuries on his body when he was arrested. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Neither MSM-MMM nor Social Democrats have the will to reduce police violence and repression. <sep><sep> Domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual harassment against sexual workers, the AIDS epidemic continues to wreak havoc despite increased awareness in the country. <sep><sep> To illustrate this, each newspaper editor divided its newspaper into 2 sections, marketing station: one for the Government Alliance, and one for the Social Alliance. <sep><sep> The parents, so ashamed, they even tried to cut their faces with their own hands. <sep><sep> To completely eradicate communalism, to give a new shine to Mauritianism, I find it not that easy, if someone doesn't come out of their cocoon where they are stuck. <sep><sep> LALIT has sent a document to the Socialist Conference in Namibia. <sep><sep> There are 11 council members, including 2 women. <sep><sep> - In Port Louis, events on February 13, 2013, when Place d'Armes was cleaned, was seen as a warning sign. <sep><sep> Bourgeois ideologists say that sometimes, when strict places do not work, it's not because of their corruption, it's just that there is a politician who is not good, a brother, who needs to be punished "man", punished "popular party", but the system is correct. <sep><sep> This is how the State of Israel believes it can do what it wants, continue its illegal colonization, continue its dominance over the Palestinian people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Leon Cremieux, one of the leaders of the New Anti-Capitalist Party (not confirmed yet). <sep><sep>Now poor people have to go through a bureaucratic process to prove they "deserve" a pension. <sep><sep>When a family has no trouble with illegal employment, they can participate more fully in the class struggle, and in political struggle, it is evident. <sep><sep>Paul Berenger even went so far as to manipulate the IBA to implement its dictatorship. <sep><sep>This is the question currently being asked by the Government, with regard to the establishment, which concerns approximately 1500-2000 arpents. <sep><sep>Meanwhile, when the linen industry in England was closing down and the British lionesses were on strike because of the war, workers in London showed their solidarity by sending boats with food to the workers in regions like Lancashire. <sep><sep>Furthermore, the Euro-Creole businesses were setting up an economic dynamic that allowed for profitable investment in trade and plantations. <sep><sep>This populist ideology, without understanding it, is a form of populism that can easily infiltrate dangerous organizations as we have already observed in the past, more precisely in the 1920s. <sep><sep>It also means that the "General Population" community has become a more defined community than before, which includes a person who is not part of it, as well as those who are not in the other 3. <sep><sep>Since 2003, we wrote a book on this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Children need to learn in an "additive" way and not in a "subtractive" way, where progress is taken away from what the children are doing. <sep><sep> It does not say if the former convicts in the quarry have passed, them. <sep><sep> And the communalists, as Alain explained, they too are "Mauritian". <sep><sep> In the industries that produce for the local market, there are many licenses; tourism has exposed its fragility during the Chikungunya epidemic. <sep><sep> There was a 2-day Conference on "strategies": Can Mauritianism combat communalism? <sep><sep> Today there are many former MMM, MSM, PTR, PMSD/XD parliamentarians who are all taking parliament pensions and still continuing their professional activities or have ventured into business. <sep><sep> Today, when we see how this nascent nationalism, even bourgeois nationalism is adopting in other classes, how is it manifesting itself? <sep><sep> But, here I would have liked to see a book by the same Samuel Huntington that I just mentioned (a book he wrote together with 2 others, Michel Crozier, and Joji Watanuki) called The Crisis of Democracy (1975). <sep><sep> The working conditions that have recently been exposed are much worse than those of workers from other countries working in Mauritius on contracts. <sep><sep> So, Nita Deerpalsingh and Cader Sayed Hossen, their role is more to ensure that the concentration of economic power in the historical bourgeois army decreases a bit.<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The countryside has suffered enough, to make the government find it necessary to change the name of a minister. <sep> The time of "general elections" was marked by lively political speeches. <sep> Something that can quickly create new jobs, on a large scale, and stable. <sep> Boss Zonn Frans is going to invest in leasing in Lasin, in Lenn, in Madagascar. <sep> Georges Gauvin, president of the Chagos Solidarity Committee (Larenyon), has intervened from the salt to say that what is extraordinary about Chagossians, Réunion and Mayotte has a common point: they are Europeans from the Indian Ocean. <sep> So after Independence, we find ourselves in a situation where historical bourgeoisie is crumbling, where petit-bourgeois is growing, but where the working class still does not seem ready to take power. <sep> It has come time to question agriculture, still based on sugar cane plantations and production. <sep> Indeed, we ensure that the elites take into account "social needs," with a bit of mercy. <sep> Comrade Lindsey went to Ecuador where they created an anti-base movement (No Bases) and there was a time when there were demonstrations to close the Manta base, an American military base, which was successfully closed. <sep> Since then, the bosses have retained a monopoly on this type of decision-making, on what to plant, what to produce, how to organize production, what kind of jobs to create. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A Zonn Frans - Lindsey machine operator is sitting down because of pay-slips from working at Floreal Knitwear - according to the award, he receives Rs106 per day, which translates to Rs 2,756 per month. <sep><sep> How to destabilize during a systemic crisis when capitalist demonstrations are taking place, we have to construct another "historical block in opposition." <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee says tear gas is an ordinary matter that gives rise to tears. <sep><sep> This harshness becomes yet another exposed spectacle of colonial British government corruption during that time, following its powerful American government ally. <sep><sep> This political fluke has been in existence since the system was questioned, since 1970-71. <sep><sep> We are only in the first year under the new Future Alliance Government. <sep><sep> He's addressing the issue with 2-3 central demands from LALIT. <sep><sep> So if we want to make progress, in addition to all the other demands we are making, we need to close this base.<sep><sep> He wants to reduce production costs for bosses by reducing real wages, through privatization, and dismantling the Welfare State. <sep><sep> That's how the Pakistani State, its repressive apparatus, and the military in particular, became an important instrument in the formation of the ruling class. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He dedicates most of his time to teaching children how to read and write. <sep><sep> Because out of the 6 doctors who have reviewed their report in the survey, 5 have said that the death of Kaya is a result of violence or some kind of shock of violence that he experienced. <sep><sep> Similarly to a magnifying glass that looks at the relationship and report between all social classes, it reflects the balance of power between social classes and at the same time intervenes in this balance of power between social classes. <sep><sep> This raises the question of what form this systemic crisis is taking among the organizations involved. <sep><sep> There are members of the WSF Organizing Committee, such as Eric Toussaint, who is also in the 4th International, in an interview in Imprecor (Feb-March 2010), recognizing the weaknesses and limitations of the WSF facing crisis and saying that it believes it is time to build another international that is more political. <sep><sep> It is only an organized working class that has this potential strength necessary to create a new more democratic political form to govern the economy. <sep><sep> Need a versatile, dynamic, large room for concerts, theater, library and internet facilities. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, Banndouk had already left for its final trip. <sep><sep> And it should be noted in this example, the boss made a call to impunity, which was well before the capitalist came into power. <sep><sep> The Employment Rights Act (2008), which replaces the Labour Act (1975), establishes basic working conditions. <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On Saturday 31st May there was a Round Table on Food Security organized by LALIT. <sep> <sep> This is a bi-annual Congress that we are organizing in February 2008 for all members and sympathizers. <sep> <sep> The money that will go to the private sector from the National Resilience Fund, it appears to support capitalists in difficulty. <sep> <sep> We want to deepen democracy as much as possible in the current system. We want to include the voice of the people, at all levels, in the workplace, in discussions on how to achieve this. <sep> <sep> There is no control over the distribution of this important resource necessary for life. <sep> <sep> The press seems to be in cahoots with this deceitful story, which creates an economic crisis on the ground for public debate. <sep> <sep> It is an amalgamation of a somewhat disparate force, which has been reigning, and is still reigning, to maintain the capitalist system in place. <sep> <sep> Among the visitors there was a minister who was an expert on disguise. <sep> <sep> On the issue of "Will America listen to what we have to say?" <sep> <sep> Present were the Prime Minister, Ramgoolam, and Foreign Minister, Boolell. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - A political party with a clear political program.
- But what is even stranger, there are many unions affiliated with the FPU that do not seem to form part of this new collective.
- One after another: Systemic crisis (with social protection), oil crisis, food crisis, global financial crisis, global economic crisis, and it has not helped counter the ecological crisis, at all.
- The British government granted a license to a private company called Pobjoy Mint to mint 2 sets of coins to commemorate this royal marriage. It's interesting to see who was involved when it was founded: Kader Bhayat, Anil Gayan, Sylvio Michel, Kailash Purryag, Karl Offman, Vishnu Lutchmeenaraidoo, Madun Dulloo, Sheila Bappoo, Michael Glover, Rama Sithanen, Armoogum Parsooramen, Jugdish Goburdhun, Mahen Utchanah, Shawkutally Soodhun, Alain Laridon, Dev Virahsawmy, Peter Craig, Emmanuel Leung Shing
- CTBV (Belle Vue Thermal Company Ltd) and CEB, for example, guarantee electricity prices for 20 years.
- In contrast, when the workers' vanguard class is meeting to discuss the unfolding of the laundry strike in a company, they realize that it is serious if there are weaknesses in the workers' side.
- Dinesh was a doctor, however, he did not put his hands in the laundry.
- And the influence of young people in LALIT is quite significant because there is no patriarchal or macho system that will make you stop abusing when you have something to say and share.
- The work that political and trade union activists have to do in our debates. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economic crises make the working class more vulnerable, causing them to be more likely to become victims. <sep><sep> As a member of a union, as a member of LALIT, one can constantly analyze the reality among the classes. <sep><sep> Everyone still remembers his words that he used to say: 'Without me, there is no sacrifice'. <sep><sep> Just like a person can reproduce through children, a social group, if he wants to reproduce himself, he naturally and automatically reproduces himself through everything he does. <sep><sep> Since the last General Election, LALIT has been anticipating that the difficulties in the Secretariat and the Free Zone may precipitate a systemic crisis that will affect all economic, political, and social aspects of the country. <sep><sep> Now, every child who wants to benefit from this subsidy will need to take steps to provide enough paperwork to prove their family's poverty. <sep><sep> Each time Subron mobilizes a sector, it finally reaches a point where he negotiates with the Labour Party. <sep><sep> There was a training session for these strict and strict trade unionists. <sep><sep> Saresh Viramalay spoke on behalf of the Playgroup Federation. <sep><sep> In the security industry, there is an acceleration of closing down businesses and a new wave of downsizing workers through the VRS. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For the first time in an official Mauritian document, the existence of a military base on its territory is openly acknowledged. <sep> <sep> I am tired as I lay down, ready to sleep. <sep> <sep>If anybody had ever believed that the Mauritian press was playing a role in advancing democracy in the country, the latest electoral campaign has definitively dispelled this notion. <sep> <sep> He looked at the 4 points of analysis that allowed for a clear explanation of the Palestinian and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <sep> <sep> MMM, as a neo-liberal ideologist since 1982 when Paul Berenger announced with all seriousness, that he was not following any dictates of the IMF-World Bank, he. <sep> <sep> This means the beginning of the end of the quota on textiles which had rights to enter Europe since the ACP countries, while other textiles (for example, those from Asia) were blocked. <sep> <sep> However, what they have achieved in the past was beautiful and successful. <sep> <sep> On this point, the decision of the Mauritian government to maintain its secret strategy will inadvertently help in facilitating initiatives that it will take regarding the Chagos islands <sep> <sep> When the Government says that it is necessary to get rid of stray animals to prevent the spread of disease, in other countries they receive compensation, here there isn't any, so naturally there is conflict on this issue. <sep> <sep> It is pointless to believe that these opposition parties today, the bourgeoisie that holds economic power today, it is pointless to think that they will bring anything constructive to the Chagos islands. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means 9% of the population has left the MMM-MSM and joined the L'Alliance Sociale. <sep> <sep> It is a short poem that reminds us of the reality and frustration of those who are unable to satisfy the desire of children to have a toy. <sep> <sep> They themselves say that maybe we need to look in this analysis of Marx if there are things that can help understand the system. <sep> <sep> In all his public statements, Ashok Subron announces that he remains a “sympathizer” of the Lalit party, and he seems to have many other resigners using a similar formula. <sep> <sep> Today, the crisis in Europe and the USA, is a sovereign crisis. <sep> <sep> Only LO has remained the same. Today, Natalie Artaud is the spokesperson. <sep> <sep> She was disgusted with them, but she grew up and realized that if she made a mistake. <sep> <sep> What kind of action will break the silence and expose the atrocities committed by the Israeli army in the occupied territories of Palestine so that the whole world can see and understand? <sep> <sep> Only, when there are 4-5 or more policemen present, then everyone invents a different version when investigating a fight that occurred. <sep> <sep> There is also a 7-member team working in the villages to provide assistance and financial support. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth is facilitating these same sectors. <sep><sep> The presence of the US military base on Diego Garcia is the biggest obstacle to the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> The development of African languages is also very different in different countries, with less development, in general, in countries that were colonized by France. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, in every city, village, we find workers from Bangladesh, China, Madagascar working in construction. <sep><sep> The system of large-scale estates introduced by the English in 1830 serves as an organizational model for Mauritius. <sep><sep> So Ah Teck, a construction company, concessions, a large construction company, Gamma Civicti, would have another major sector for electricity production from salt pans. <sep><sep> and program documents from very far back, such as the Program on Drugs, on Internationalism, on Voluntary Sterilization, on Regional Democracy (City and Village). <sep><sep> Therefore, majority shareholders of newspapers will naturally hesitate to bankrupt their newspapers, risking advertising money (from big capitalists) or risking not earning money (from big banks) or risking provoking anger, which risks their downfall in a thousand other ways. <sep><sep> The MMM, too, before 1981, opposed capitalism, colonialism, and imperialist powers. <sep><sep> Just now, after 30 years, the capitalist system in Mauritius is tearing society apart, falling into multiple crises, local and global: the common people are suffering. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This entrepreneur's success was dependent on the support of the Workers' State for his business. <sep><sep> Present at the press conference were Jugdish Bhantooa, Ram Seegobin, Lindsey Collen, Alain Ah-Vee, Rajni Lallah, Rada Kistnasamy, Andre Pierre, and Cindy Clelie. <sep><sep> It's funny, but no newspaper interviewed lawyer Rex Stephen to publish his views on the current situation. <sep><sep> In practice, we know from the time of 1970-71, when the PT-PMSD regime imposed state controls, made numerous trade unionists repressed, imprisoned trade unionists, broke strikes and even demanded employers to dismiss striking workers. <sep><sep> Negotiations that finally ended in what is called "photo opportunities." <sep><sep> It's different from all other philosophical ways before, and mostly after, yesterday, because it went to see in a way that society has changed. <sep><sep> That is, there has been a long period where dictators have succeeded. <sep><sep> Take, for example, in Chile when President Allende, a socialist government came to power through elections, very quickly, in 1973, a military bureaucracy overthrew him. <sep><sep> There were members in the labor unions, artisans, workers from rural areas in unions, and active transport workers in unions. <sep><sep> It is with great regret that other articles that were supposed to follow our book are not included much in the State, but were not directly on this subject. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Dayer Sithanen had announced a reform of labor legislation in his first budget speech. <sep> Also, with the Chikungunya epidemic ongoing, the tourism industry is facing difficulties. <sep> Isn't it the case that Israel exerts control over 4 million Palestinians living under a military regime that suppresses all their civic and political rights, where today they are confronted with violent behavior by security forces and Israeli settlers? <sep> It often doesn't even know which class it belongs to. <sep> This means that there needs to be a political conscience that explains, gives you an idea, of how you can assimilate, defend these rights. <sep> Today, we find ourselves facing a situation where more and more military members are in open revolt - more soldiers and even military leaders are contesting or refusing to follow orders. <sep> There was some emphasis on new concepts such as "solidarity economy" and "fair trade" not only in agriculture, but also in other sectors like craftsmanship. <sep> Thus, the repressive reflex of the Labor Party from the 70s has returned. <sep> This means less union activity, less industrial action. <sep> It's not enough to just participate in a small demonstration from time to time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, we, we need to sell our labor force, the majority of people. <sep><sep> Now, when people in religion ask for time-off, workers in other religions, ask for other time-off? <sep><sep> But it is something that shows you the direction for a more global understanding, not just a problem in one sector, not just about the law, not just about health. <sep><sep> But it felt like there was a difference, a big difference indeed. <sep><sep> There is more respect in the press for city people than for rural people. <sep><sep> What there will be, is what Europe is calling a "price of reference" that will be indexed on the price of risk on the global market. <sep><sep> On a confessional level, there should not have been competition because the hereditary system meant that an economic elite took "two per cent per year". <sep><sep> To measure that the movement of demands becomes sectorial, without raising economic and political issues in favor of the capitalist that the Social Alliance is imposing. <sep><sep> They are finishing in a bourgeois corner, if not becoming apolitical, abandoning political rent. <sep><sep> Already they are doing it in England, the USA, and Europe, by force, when they nationalize. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During this last year, we also found Navin Ramgoolam in a position where he claims to have experience. <sep> It is our duty, us that have lived for 79 years, to transmit this experience. <sep> He seemed a little confused, just looking like a newborn baby. <sep> The government must mandate the establishment to grant all licensed workers and artisans a plot of land to grow food products, grouped in cooperatives. <sep> Working-class people throughout the 1970s have mobilized against capitalist power. <sep> We must use the knowledge of people on plantations and farms, link them and scientific knowledge. <sep> The government, we all know, decided for a valid reason to send an ambassador to New York with a legal education and expertise in international law. <sep> So, just when we were understanding the systemic crisis in Mauritius, we were hit by a global systemic crisis. <sep> Despite its drawbacks, it had an enormous capacity for work. <sep> And Marx ultimately found that beings whose natural connection with the earth has been broken by human intervention. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How many times have olive trees been planted more in dances than exposed to attacks since the tears of attacks from the colonizers? <sep><sep> He had said that even before there was a bombardment, the Israeli government was already blocking: it was occupying all access points to Gaza preventing people from leaving, and preventing medicine, food from entering. <sep><sep> We have witnessed this in history, the Indian people in America when European colonizers arrived, the Aboriginal people in Australia when English colonizers colonized Australia. <sep><sep> Workers have become accustomed and have asked him to return. <sep><sep> Charlesia Alexis was injured during a clash with RIOT, and his head was bleeding. <sep><sep> However, when he escaped, he, he shot with a cord attached to dry branches, and fell. <sep><sep> For me unity and national identity is when we promote our culture for ourselves, not just for tourists, it is when we have the courage to recognize that unity does not mean uniformity without equality, etc. <sep><sep> An acne comes out, like a listener, a plant, it comes out in nature. <sep><sep> The MMM-MSM document also says that the “risk” of the prosecution is related to the party that could have the most risk. <sep><sep> There is a parallel in other countries, especially in South Africa, compared to here, where there was a colonial administration, a colonial power where there was a British capital dominance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What he is doing is taking a stance against the management of the central worker class, then looking for little issues to pick with him, he is trying to get the union leader on his side to go against him. <sep><sep> The first punch was from the Israeli Government, and along with them is the American Government that is supporting him. <sep><sep> They have consolidated their alliances, and they are succeeding in gaining entry to the Presidency. <sep><sep> And the big "democrats" of the country are in a very calm state. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, you may think it's strong but the government is playing with numbers to mask itself, then after that, they are encouraging the youth to follow all kinds of courses. <sep><sep> Gramsci, in a different way, not contradictory, explains the same phenomenon. <sep><sep> And that useless piece of paper will build a stone house worth 1,000 arpents in Medine, a corner of its value multiplied by 10, by 15 times. <sep><sep> It will have an impact on other organizations and various sectors in Mauritius. <sep><sep> There is a drastic figure in terms of price reduction where the "sugar" industry is centralizing and converting into a "cane" industry. <sep><sep> So, what exactly was the Minister announcing at the launch of the Creole Festival? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the government has faced difficulties and struggles to function outside the administration. <sep><sep> Wednesday and Friday are not very good because Friday is considered unlucky and most weddings take place on Sunday. <sep><sep> Since the opposition has been officially weakened since 2005, and despite a financial and economic crisis, the Labour Party led by Navin Ramgoolam has managed to remain relatively strong until now, around general elections, that is. <sep><sep> Paul Berenger has been known to make clear communal and casteist speeches at his public meetings. <sep><sep> And when there was a bombing in Gaza, LALIT organized a solidarity vigil with Saint Idriss Goomany. <sep><sep> Karim said the two of them had gotten into an intense argument one day: - I was furious. <sep><sep> And if you have a class analysis of Mauritian society, whatever the circumstances are, you have to acknowledge these diversities, these contradictions. <sep><sep> Has the majority of people realized that the proposed new development is leading us towards capitalist exploitation through government economic policies? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Firstly, the definition of "bourgeoisie" needs clarification; there is also confusion on this. <sep><sep> That is, we look at it for pleasure at the same time as we "appreciate" it at a deeper level. <sep><sep> His mother explained to him well what was written in the family destiny. <sep><sep> After the Gulf War in 1991 and sabotage of all peace in the world and the Indian Ocean, China is leading the world into a logic of war that could threaten the resistance of humanity itself. <sep><sep> To celebrate Labour Day among our members, sympathizers, families, and other organizations, and we are reading local and international messages <sep><sep> In an economic crisis, traditional parties no longer have the capacity to propose any solutions. <sep><sep> He explained the work they are doing in the Salfit region a little. <sep><sep> In the Executive, there are stevedore sectors, fishery sectors, trolley sectors, all kinds of different sectors, and all are represented, everyone is giving their opinion. <sep><sep> * Collapse, or disintegration (as he is often called), or. <sep><sep> So, the GWF also had this consideration. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Marx and Engels referred to "a whole society", they were referring to "a society in a historical context". <sep>
 
<sep> This flow on the definition of people and their country is an important element to understand the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. <sep>

<sep> A MMSD council - Eric Guimbeau made choices and allied with PT/PMSD to govern the Ministries. <sep>
 
<sep> Then there are some who are adamant, that this "lentil" is not even edible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is what the announcement of the Central Committee of the Group Zenn Lalit on 29th October. <sep><sep> The book Lalit is launching today will serve as the main tool for Lalit members for the campaign. <sep><sep> We must not become prisoners of events now, just because we are forced to exit the prison of events. <sep><sep> For these notables, this was necessary because the link between political power and control of society was strong. <sep><sep> Language policy since independence has failed to protect Kreol and Bhojpuri outside all official institutions, especially in education. <sep><sep> In this context, we were surprised to learn that the Mauritius government has fully surrendered its aviation rights to the U.S.? <sep><sep> All unions have been informed and there have been articles in L'Express and Samdi Plus. <sep><sep> Clearly, neither the government nor the municipalities have the capacity to handle the problem. <sep><sep> and where our 2 members are participating in the 16th Congress in Ostend, Belgium. <sep><sep> Therefore, it is being threatened with the establishment of a public decision regarding a disaster management plan for the textile and sugar industry, it is a political decision. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So at one point where the debate on the importance of Creole and Bhojpuri languages becomes increasingly favorable <sep> <sep> They are definitely looking for ways to make the Indian Ocean a Peace Zone. <sep> <sep> It depends on whether the union functions in a democratic manner, whether there are some cooperatives that have the backbone of democratic organization. <sep> <sep> to avoid changing size from such an important issue as violations by government officials for their comminatory-political tactics. <sep> <sep> While the MSM says it's over with the Best Loser Comminatory exercise and then start nomination representation party. <sep> <sep> It means that it is no longer work that you start and then continue until you retire but you have to be creative. <sep> <sep> MLF will contribute to the publication of a book against communalism that the Anti-Communal Movement has published. <sep> <sep> And, the argument of defenders of the Best Loser system, how can't we just fire Best Loser himself without a general electoral reform, it's a purely illogical argument. <sep> <sep> What surprises many people present is the similarity "life at work" in this great uprising of a profession and sector where people who were present at work. <sep> <sep> Here we have the pleasure of publishing the discourse text Lindsey Collen for the World Philosophy Day on MBC TV, Wednesday 26 November: <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The foreign exchange market, also known as the foreign exchange or forex market, is also absorbing the local original crisis. <sep> <sep> Afterwards, each insurance company negotiates its own policy with the union. <sep> <sep> It is true in Mauritius, it is true in part in the world, that people are full, that they want everything to be correct. <sep> <sep> In 1979, UASI had a demand for recognition in front of the IRC. <sep> <sep> * There is an article that explains what Ramgoolamism is - it was written in 1986 by Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen. <sep> <sep> But, for us, this "State", it concerns another size, a size of a lot of clear size: it concerns precisely this will in certain individuals, since the beginning of class society, to come together, create a better society. <sep> <sep> Commissions have also done important work, by size: Trade Union, Language and Education Commission, International, Diego, Environment and Ecology, Web, Documentation. <sep> <sep> In the past if you went to a moneylender to borrow money to build a house, or to buy a house. <sep> <sep> However for the blacks, this was not practical. <sep> <sep> It is easy today, with the internet to publish a such series of lists. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They were sitting on a well-prepared platform, meaning they refused to put the community on the Nomination Paper, then when they presented their candidature, they convinced the Electoral Commission officers. <sep>

<sep> with all its barbarity like torture, a delicate balance in the ocean, irine on the balance, locking up on the mainland, killing children, etc. <sep>
<sep> This vote represented an act of disapproval of  the electoral process and in favor of resistance, including armed resistance. <sep>
<sep> Mobilization for a solid military base is attracting international attention. <sep>
<sep> And then, Paul Berenger will vote for a resolution to obtain full compensation in his Rose Hill Meeting, Paul Berenger will defend the tripartite agreement. <sep>
<sep> We provide a clear example: the press does not denounce Paul Berenger when he makes derogatory calls in No 2 Port Louis, they only report what he says, and find it normal. <sep>
<sep> While the PTR, MMM and MSM claim that Lerop, for unspecified reasons, insists that his money is only used to send workers overseas and re-industrialize the sugar industry. <sep>
<sep> In times of downturn, where there is a downturn, it can give the impression that nothing has been achieved, so many problems remain. <sep>
<sep> We believe that the state should have a balanced policy towards all press. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is a volunteer in Red Crescent working with deaf children and in the psychological program in Women For Life.<sep> Ful Manb Lalit was elected in the last weekend's annual assembly to elect a new Central Committee for the year 2006.<sep> That was when he said "nothing comes out of nothing". <sep> He had already started “peeling off” PPP from degenerate and communist militants, making them go away. <sep> There is a need to continue our work on class struggle as the motor for changing society, continuing reflections in our work site, in the union. <sep> As he had a little meaning he drew; drawing on the ground with a stick; <sep> But now, with Obama's leadership, people are overcoming this bipartisanship, and new movements are arising against political parties financed by capitalists. <sep> To reclaim its place in the workforce, they had him sign a new labor contract. <sep> They are implementing a neo-liberal policy in a context where the Preferential Trade Agreement that Mauritius had for textiles is disappearing. <sep> We salute the courage of all the protesters who protested in Cancun under difficult conditions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and transferring money from poor people to increase the profit of the boss in the sugar, textile, and tourism industries. <sep><sep> This kind of classification that exists in Best Loser is a form of apartheid, a crime that has been ongoing since the time of slavery and colonization. <sep><sep> * There will be no democratic control over public services. <sep><sep> The high cost of living in the local market, even though we pay in shops, is a problem. <sep><sep> Objections from the USA and Europe to their positions on UNESCO have proven their incompetence. <sep><sep> And if they finance something, they will not have to answer politically if they are financing a nonsense. <sep><sep> MMM also supports certain sections of the working class, especially in the labor aristocracy (parastatal workers, skilled workers, craftsmen, workers with a trade). <sep><sep> the Catholic secondary school, mainly financed by the state, offers 50% reserved seats for Form I to 6 students in its 4 "better" schools for children close to schools in Curepipe, Q. <sep><sep> There are ex-PT members like Danraj Boodhoo who went with the MSM, and Radhika Jagatsing who went with the MMSD. There is a reshuffling going on. <sep><sep> We are pleased that Alain Ah-Vee is participating in it for Lalit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The weather clears up when he realizes his mood is improving. <sep> In 1983, there was a White Paper on Agricultural Diversification according to M. <sep> They are working towards a new "historic bloc," where everyone is striving to reach their maximum potential for their class - to provide an alternative to the current capitalist system. <sep> And the Government needs to guarantee this 4 billion Air Mauritius. <sep> However, in a way, we are all accustomed to a life that depends on our own domination and exploitation. <sep> But when this comes before the NRB, MSPA says, "What is this, 2 systems?" "No, it's not that!" It's challenging before the Supreme Court. <sep> The police say that Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen were fortunate to insult a police officer on December 19, 2002 at the Queen Mary Peace Social Center, Port Louis. <sep> It is a protest action, but it is an initiative action. <sep> After 2 weeks of strike, and there is no time to say drink water, even 2 weeks 3 weeks. <sep> Some people went to see Mr. Macque who made a call to aid LALIT militant Roland Fozoo after he was beaten by the police. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>There is a terrible flu but there are also overlapping symptoms. <sep> To overcome it, elections must be held, so we see that the bourgeoisie parties are trying to form an electoral alliance and a working-class front. <sep>So, Berenger, instead of focusing on sovereignty issues, must focus on women's issues. <sep> He is lost in an underground labyrinth where he understands neither his world, nor the world of Diego. <sep> There are leaders in Lalit who are either too cautious or too eccentric to want to destroy a unified front. <sep> And the conversion must start now, using less carbon (less private cars and more trains, for example). <sep> We find that LALIT has an important role as a political party that challenges bourgeois rule, to ensure that it is not just a revolt against the system of capitalism, not just a revolt against emptiness. <sep> So, on this level, it will always be on the "current crisis in the economy" (Mauritius often, but also in the world) - the way LALIT sees it - always explaining a series of essential definitions to understand "Marxist economics". <sep> In the framework of the 1st May, it is important to highlight the need for this international struggle. <sep> It is in line with the African Union's decision to establish its academy, ACALAN. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is not enough money to provide a small pension for retirees, but there is enough money for large pensions for ministers and deputies if they are not elected. <sep><sep> So they leave, the Lalit Travayers who will come later OMT, then disappear. <sep><sep> We, in LALIT, find "press burzwa" (including radio) as part of "Leta" in the strictest sense of "Leta". <sep><sep> And yet it is a crisis that affects all aspects of life: as a worker, as a resident of a neighborhood. <sep><sep> Already in the transport industry, when Moka-Flacq Transport closed, Vacoas Transport closed, this is affecting up to 2,000 workers who are being laid off. <sep><sep> Then you get neighborhood committees, they organize groups in the countryside, they come into struggle: from Bambous, from Plaisance, from Ste Croix. <sep><sep> Since recently it has meant that the last 10,000 bananas have been planted and harvested. <sep><sep> And yesterday we found an oversight of its quality intervention. <sep><sep> The bank is failing, insurance companies going bankrupt, the Stock Exchange falling globally, including Mauritius, is struggling, companies are closing down. <sep><sep> In the late 1980s, MLF organized a hunger strike from the Anjalay monument that started in Pont Fer, Phoenix, and went up to Kirpip. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The police started with the principle of "know what you know" and went on to link it./ <sep>Let LALIT and Seetulsing, 2007, (and he answered). <sep>Why weren't true democratic questions posed. Shouldn't there have been a "power balance between the Executive and the National Assembly? <sep>Then who was his electoral adversary representing the adversary of his class? <sep>There are only 450 planters with more than 12 acres and only 50 with more than 100 acres, but between them they own almost half of the 100,000 acres of land on the sugarcane plain. <sep> But when he saw Berenger counteracting PT, he signed the Local Government Act. <sep>All of these concepts that make you dizzy serve to conceal the reality of class, the reality of the class struggle. <sep> -Hey there! Why? -Ayoyo! Why? -Stop with the heys and ayoyos. <sep> The second fraction of capitalism has created a relationship between humanity (biological creator like all other creatures depending on the mother earth to live) with the land that nurtures us. <sep> Therefore, it wasn't just one of the leaders inventing demands. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If you live in bourgeoisie, you absorb and are familiar with the ideologies that your objective position in society gives you. <sep><sep> The energy that pushed him to take over the family business, the flame that inspired people by the hundred when they needed encouragement, the love that held his family together despite lots of conflicts, hadn't diminished. <sep><sep> He took a stand in favor of dismantling the Diego Garcia base, in favor of Mauritian sovereignty, and of the rights of Mauritian-Chagossians. <sep><sep> The LALIT party, from the 80s onward, he said, has relentlessly progressed in the struggle to change the electoral system. <sep><sep> And the State helped big planters move into other industries: toothpaste, soap, pharmaceuticals, batteries, heating elements, any number of products which state-owned enterprises could then buy, for example. <sep><sep> Aziz found that his family was becoming prettier. <sep><sep> The public usually has the right to information to make comments on public interest issues. <sep><sep> The MR party lost power in the regional assembly, but their MP Nicolas Von Mally joined the Government as Minister of Fisheries. <sep><sep> However, their two largest economic sectors are not likely to see much job creation. <sep><sep> We need to work and live on what we produce in a sustainable manner. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are already facing the effects of the global economic crisis, with food and energy crises. <sep> <sep> And when the ruling class takes power, it takes power for the majority of people. <sep> <sep> Dear: Perhaps when we finish discussing a point that Comrade Jane has solved, we will move on to the question of "meritocracy", which seems a bit like "Mauritianism". <sep> <sep> In 2004, we started with Mr. Naden Pakeeree, whose wife, Padmini, died due to illegal work. <sep> <sep> In response, this systemic crisis will affect many societies and all these problems will persist, perhaps for a long time, perhaps even worse. <sep> <sep> And it's not necessarily guided by good moral leadership, or justice, or reason, but by the existence of a class domination. <sep> <sep> Briefly, there are 3 main economic sectors in Mauritius that employ many people. <sep> <sep> Therefore, from the MMM and the Labour Party, there are very similar things in their history. <sep> <sep> The oil crisis is coming and it will be here, because when oil, diesel, coal, they end, they end. <sep> <sep> Obviously, as I said at the beginning, in different periods it takes different forms. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee, a member of the LALIT direction, delivered a speech analyzing the current political situation during the Regional Seminar Enn Zurne, Kirpip, on Sunday, 17th April. <sep><sep> The PT-MSM-PMSD government granted the private company, Patel, 60 arpents of land in Cassis. <sep><sep> and supporting a course for the strengthening of academic training in mother tongue language at the University to enhance academic skills. <sep><sep> Why aren't we discussing long-term alternatives for sugar and textile; why aren't we focusing on the potential to create value-added products by initiating agro-industrial activity for exportation and nourishment on a large scale. <sep><sep> Yesterday, he had his boyfriend, an athlete who leads a gym, and he is happy to have his muscular arms around him and lift him up. <sep><sep> In the Nursing Association, in the FSSC, when facing leadership challenges, more often than not, he becomes timid. <sep><sep> The leaflet says, "We need to Serve 'Larzan Lerop' to CREATE JOBS NOT DESTROY JOBS"; "More Training ALLOCATION COMMITMENT"; The motto must return to the Central Bank to REDUCE DEPRECIATION Rs."; For all V.R.S. workers. <sep><sep> If we decide to fight for the mother tongue, something strategically important, a strategic night, look at its essence: it frees your mind. <sep><sep> But, the plenary session was very, very, very, funny, with a lot of reflection behind what everyone who spoke had to say. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy said "I was shocked by the degree of military occupation in Japan's mailboxes". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The fact that LALIT has been saying since 2005, that R&A does not question the Besluzer system in their cases, all this has become evident after the UNHRC decision. <sep><sep> PMSD, also in the new Government, does not have much to say, really. <sep><sep> In particular, we will take a stand against the privatization of the tax collection (against MRA), against the privatization of services such as the postal service, and against the privatization of all services and utilities. <sep><sep> The dollar has no international legal tender despite the fact that it is printed. <sep><sep> In the Nursing Association, there have been some very violent fights for leadership. In the GTU, so many violent fights have occurred that it has caused a split. <sep><sep> Especially after the partial one, in the MMM there are many who say that the MSM does not deserve 50%. <sep><sep> This type of brute force drives, draws, drives, against political opponents, is very harmful to democracy. <sep><sep> The success of the Creole Writing Course organized in Ut the previous week by the LPT. <sep><sep> I have lived during this period when I have spent time with this family that life on a boat means a lot. <sep><sep> His death represents a major loss for the socialist movement in the region and in the world. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We were reminded of the use of the European Compensation Plan (130 million Euros between 2007 and 2010), which is 5 billion rupees for: <sep><sep> With the publication FOOD FOR THOUGHT, we invite people to reflect on the major societal issues to write and make their reflections accessible to all interested individuals. <sep><sep> There is a laser protection system that automatically triggers laser shots if anyone approaches the distance at that boundary. <sep><sep> We are getting marks of lynx, hamburger grave, and all kinds of licenses, patents, where a certain percentage of each front-page country is imperialist. <sep><sep> What was most important is the decision and preparation for the introduction of the mother tongue in government primary schools for the first time in history. <sep><sep> It was a deadly restriction for Mauritius between relative economic independence. <sep><sep> The employers organized a global forum for "economy", they do this in Davos, Laswis, World Economic Forum. <sep><sep> And it can have a bad balance, where they bring a lot of repression. <sep><sep> A major point in the Budget is that it includes the largest public works plan in history, it is true. <sep><sep> The two alliances present their program a week before the election show that they do not want to debate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And what the Ut 79 strike has done is awaken the consciousness of the working class, where workers in the countryside have realized what this Workers' Party is. <sep><sep> If the employer is well organized, they put pressure forcefully, then the Government applies its economic policies and labor laws heavily in favor of the employer. <sep><sep> Today our Congress systematically analyzes how daily there are similar incidents that exist and how to handle such incidents. <sep><sep> UNESCO with their Labor Education book, their literature, their Creole dictionary with materials that are more appropriate and relevant than what an ordinary dictionary would cover in a person's life. <sep><sep> And in conclusion, they will tell us that they need a basis to protect the marine park. <sep><sep> These are measures that are usually followed when there is a big problem, a "shipwreck." <sep><sep> 2. More we were circling 2 internal documents. <sep><sep> The Navin Ramgoolam Social Alliance reported its victory with 49% in votes against MMM-MSM-PMSD with 43%. <sep><sep> ERiA and EReA labor laws, two laws that aim to make licensing easier and workers' claims more difficult. <sep><sep> whether it is a party like the Lalit Party, a party like the Movman Premye Me, it realizes that its strength lies in its principles, its mobilization which can lead to the satisfaction of its claims. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> - As you wish, speak! - I have already told them. <sep><sep> Despite Minister Baichoo continuing to say that the Government has no plans to privatize CNT, this proposal to pull staff from the PRB from CNT represents confirmation that privatization is underway. <sep><sep> Marx used this situation to have a meeting with workers from different European countries and to start the First International which gathered workers' associations, but also political and individual organizations. <sep><sep> There was a lively family meeting on Sunday 21st October in Mama Bul Later, Grand Rivyer. <sep><sep> This is done because it will no longer be possible to govern with the old methods like the 16th and 18th centuries. <sep><sep> - Claudine, have you prepared the documents to change the company's name? - Yes, madam. <sep><sep> There was a big platform for a universal strike, but ultimately it became a universal strike against the will of the bourgeoisie, against the will of the owning class. <sep><sep> And then, we start to see people come to life that have a consciousness that created Occupy Wall Street, where they target financial capital. <sep><sep> From that day on, Timi realized that his politics were special and funny at the same time. <sep><sep> Watching it like a sword cutting through the noisy quilt that was hanging everywhere. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The British government has obtained permission to make a call, and is making a call against the injustice that Orders in Council which banned Chagossian illegal. <sep><sep> Who will provide a garden 61-year-old, a 61-year-old mason, a 61-year-old forklift, work? <sep><sep> it may be difficult for a day laborer in a public transport concept, but I believe instead we all take on this responsibility, We have decided to come together. <sep><sep> These two partners, they represent only a small group of two people who pretend to be leaders, Ashock Jugnauth and Eric Guimbeau. <sep><sep> So, we have a job to do to organize the working class and the awareness of the need for this POLITICAL bedrock based on a political program. <sep><sep> Today there is a lot of pressure from employers in the textile, textile, and tourism sectors to accelerate the depreciation of the rupee, and even to go for a devaluation. <sep><sep> Sandia asked Yosi, "Haven't you forgotten our eleven friends?" - No! They have received the message. <sep><sep> The police say he invited them to be present. <sep><sep> At the launch, Ragini Kistnasamy said how when President Bush visited the Middle East last, he only went to Bethlehem. <sep><sep> This means a social class by a useful definition for understanding society. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And, as you may notice, there are well-known writers who are internationally respected such as Ananda Devi, Dev Virahsawmy, Henri Favory, Khal Torabally, Umar Timol. <sep><sep> Nirmal is coming soon, his daughter is composing an exam at L'Alliance Francaise today, he is asking for an excuse. <sep><sep> We have also received a new wave of response when John Pilger's film, Stealing a Nation was not aired on television. <sep><sep> The government - most people perceive the government as an extrapolation of the family budget. <sep><sep> There was a neighborhood meeting in Suriname on Sunday morning about a campaign for an alternative economic policy. <sep><sep> This is how in 2011, we produced 5 issues of Revi: no. 98 to 102 and we built a distribution network for Revi through branches, regional and subscription. <sep><sep> In the "Measuring support" from the European Union, it is supposed to be compensation for developing the economy in general, but it is being used, until now (according to the Multi-Annual Adaptation Strategy), almost entirely for the development of the sugarcane sector; <sep><sep> When Kaya died in February 1999, there was lament, where all young people protested in their own way. <sep><sep> Right after that, there was a beginning of a challenge against Cher on a communal basis, but this approach did not go very far. <sep><sep> Since then, all research has confirmed that there was no State in society for more than 9/10th of human history. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the systemic crisis is in full swing, when 42% of workers are struggling with an SME, when many people are struggling, it is a moment for everyone in the working class (that is, those working for a salary). <sep><sep> Remember the time in 14 when the PT and how Satcam Boolell were encouraging them. <sep><sep> They have already come a long way in the class struggle with the boss. <sep><sep> When we arrived at another checkpoint waiting for the service to go to As-sawarya, a public bus arrived, 2 soldiers stopped the bus at the checkpoint. <sep><sep> MBC's spokesperson, despite his good intentions, has shown total confusion on this important link between language and literacy. <sep><sep> This new communal wave, it will raise its head in a crisis if we do not organize it well. <sep><sep> All of us, that is, all of us enlightened people, must stay alert when these 2-3 obstacles are blocking the progress that this new reality represents. <sep><<sep> Alain made a gesture to show unity since Independence. <sep><sep> There is a journalist who is staying in Lotel, with the intention of writing an article about the Lotel company. <sep><sep> The importance of a Freedom of Information Act isn't just for the press, but it is especially so that the public has the right to information. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Meanwhile, we have raised a question of who and how decides what to plant in this country, what to produce in the country. <sep><sep> This poses another problem, as 2 out of these 4 suppose 'communities' in the Constitution of Mauritius, they have their own religions, meaning they are involved in some way. <sep><sep> Just as Great Britain has recently decided to establish a Marine Park, a Marine Protected Area around Chagos for the next 6 months. <sep><sep> With the fragmentation progressing in the trade union movement, where the GWF and FPU have come out of 2 federations to become 5-6 in the last 1 year, where instead of having a unified union platform, we are witnessing the collapse of federations from now on. <sep><sep> In turn, this means that prisons no longer play any role in "reforming" individuals. <sep><sep> This "historical bloc" has been destabilizing in the USA since, with the recent globalization, financial capital has been challenged, displaced, and has allied with the armed bourgeoisie from a position of force, from 1990 onwards. <sep><sep> It is very conservative and difficult for it to go into a logical alternative. <sep><sep> There are many laws that say "Well, you can buy a nail for such a price". <sep><sep> Everything that will happen in the future will largely depend on how we act today. <sep><sep> Private property system does not insist on protecting the environment if it is not in the individual interests of the property owners. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Nick Leake continues, The High Commission will continue to work with the Chagossian Community here. The British Commissioner will continue to engage with the Chagossian community in Mauritius here. <sep><sep> Those who were not happy about it, they had to swallow their pride, so much so that they were choked with a colic which caused their stomachs to be upset. <sep><sep> We have discovered a brand of kosher Israeli fried food called "JAFFA" which is being sold in certain supermarkets. <sep><sep> But, when it comes to collective bargaining, collective negotiations, labor rights become important. <sep><sep> Stir the pot, fire the pot to keep the fire burning." - The pot-stirring conversation returns. <sep><sep> We will mobilize people on the basis of demands that will allow us to move out of this current "economic disaster" where we are stuck now. <sep><sep> When the MMM-MSM Government is inviting private universities from other countries to do business on education here, we in LALIT, we well understand what lies behind this. <sep><sep> * Are the appointments that we classify appropriate, not just a useless ritual or a competition between machos? <sep><sep> They do this to increase the yield of a seed we are planting and to make it more resistant to bacteria, parasites, and climatic conditions. <sep><sep> The existence of a military base on Diego is in contradiction with the rights of the Chagossians to return. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When we no longer hear talks of "emancipation," no longer hear talks of "equality," we know there is something bright in the strategy. <sep><sep> It's not like a storm in a teacup. <sep><sep> - Hey, my three gurus should have been there! Just as he finished saying that, he was there sitting in front of them. <sep><sep> All this seems to have a single goal: for Berenger, with his usual media arrogance, to prove that he (MMM) has 2 options while PT and MSM each have a single option. <sep><sep> Like in a chess game, sometimes a pawn becomes very important. <sep><sep> We want to say that many workers were employed, direct employment, and also many people seated, indirectly with these 2 sectors. <sep><sep> Rokowitz, and the capitalist "ideology" promoted by the capitalist system, also has an "ideology" in the sense of a dogma. <sep><sep> He can solve something for that person, but the problem remains whole. <sep><sep> Neeta Deerpalsing and Cader Sayed Hossen represent the interests of a bourgeois section (we are talking about local investors, not government employees), which "blocks" a work that the Labour Party has historically done. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we find it politically useful to have a presence in the press, even if it is a bourgeois press with all its limitations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He is very poorly, despite the Rs1 billion that was allocated to him in 2009, and has hardly used almost anything. <sep> <sep> How did this National Platform start, and with what purpose? <sep> <sep> On what points did LALIT decide to separate itself from the group WANTED: 15,000 Youngsters to Save our Future? <sep> <sep> Comrade Kisna has told them about the similarities between Guantanamo and Diego Garcia. <sep> <sep> Like hermit crabs, the GSEK leaders are hiding away waiting for the storm to pass. <sep> <sep> But, we are still suffering from this attempt to introduce the concept of "class solidarity". <sep> <sep> and he did it. This is political maneuvering. <sep> <sep> Samy and Sinndi had a discreet relationship. <sep> <sep> When Marie-Noelle Derby, a press photographer, died in 2009 due to illegal abortion, we also started with her family. <sep> <sep> When Roland Fozoo went to the Intermediate Court for Zizman, the Magistrate said he was remand for the 30th of November. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The current government's excessive pursuit of economic advantage for the Mauritian bourgeoisie continues. <sep> We are talking about working in the proletarian class in a factory setting. <sep> The philosophy behind the MSM/MMM process is a "power-sharing" between "2 political parties" in an electoral alliance. <sep> Candidates who have never worn masks before. <sep> Therefore, the worker, as an individual or a mass, sees his own production as something outside of him, which does not concern him. <sep> Did you know that Palestinians, Israelis, and people from all over the world came together for a 200 km protest march against the wall? <sep> LALIT will start by commenting on the proposals by the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Rama Sitha-nen, and others, and they will formulate their proposals accordingly. <sep> A person honest, politically reasonable, and with great experience. <sep> In this session today, it is to transmit that experience, and to use this history to explain our position as a party today. <sep> So Minister Shakeel Mohamed thinks his Prime Minister is a hypocrite. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this shows that they are leading us into a trap. <sep><sep> There is strict organization for all categories - from scouts, guides, student councils, to senior citizens clubs. <sep><sep> 2-3 people work in a club, and at the same time, one person works in 2-3 clubs. <sep><sep> There are other MMMSP executive directors who are under MMM observation. <sep><sep> -The government is moving forward, implementing its "social residency" where there is a list targeting the "poor". <sep><sep> Without going into detail on the scandals, we find that these scandals represent some aspects of the process of "economic democratization" by the PT / MSM / PMSD alliance. <sep><sep> The new Local Government Act is also another sign with its prohibition of deputies from standing in Municipal elections, and the redrawing of wards to reduce the strength of MMM. <sep><sep> (It may be clear to some, but the process is more confusing.) <sep><sep> -Against anti-worker laws such as the Employment Relations Act and Employment Rights Act. <sep><sep> There is a tendency to treat all what they call "small parties" as one group without distinguishing if there is a party like LALIT, which has been in existence since 1982, with a clear, well-defined program. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Very soon, politicians began to feel the growing turmoil. <sep><sep> - He is working for the unemployed thanks to the government's vision that no longer needs to shine in the sun. <sep><sep> Normally, the law concerns matters of property, civil status, who can marry whom, when married parties are similar, the goat should be given, etc. <sep><sep> When we arrived there, we were given a small house. <sep><sep> That is, it has diversified its sugar cane, diversified its capital in tourism, in IRS, in electricity production, ethanol, it has new banks that it has opened. <sep><sep> It has told us how, over 5 months, tears have brought bulldozers to the top of the mountain and put a fence in a nearly unbearable pace. <sep><sep> So, all that, to say in general terms that we have yellow to analyze society so that we understand it, so we cannot satisfy ourselves by just looking at the surface, as we do in school, in newspapers, in everyday life. <sep><sep> They are also trying to get the government to reduce the levy (especially tax) called Cess, from 1,000 rupees that the government deducts from each ton of sugar, decrease it by 50%. <sep><sep> In Japan, there was a shortage of coins in circulation in a month. <sep><sep> And in Mauritius, being at risk of a popular boycott in Europe yesterday against our sugar if it is not GMO-FREE; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The new national identity card will be a one-card system that we do not agree with. <sep> <sep> They can no longer question the system, they prefer to adapt to the system. <sep> <sep> Yesterday, Ganoo was too eager to become a Prime Minister. <sep> <sep> If we keep focusing on the surface of the sea to understand what is happening, we will not understand anything. <sep> <sep> So here MMM's analysis of the working class simply brings it into terrible political problems. <sep> <sep> In LALIT we deplore the anti-democratic regulations that the Socialist Alliance government has passed, especially in an election, making it more serious. <sep> <sep> For example, my sun in Mauritian culture and in French culture, even if I pronounce them the same, they are not the same. <sep> <sep> All students need to do a certain number of volunteer work per week in social organizations in relation to the economy. <sep> <sep> When a young person is working, there was much debate on the role of the two Intifadas. <sep> <sep> In history, there is a ONE-DAY work that the current government has done that will remain. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It would have been better if we could have avoided institutionalizing punishments. <sep><sep> Everyone recognized his great capacity for work, his political vision that allowed him to often take risky positions or decisions and then to mark points and pull his team into the game. But for a long time he was walking on a dangerous red wire; dangerous for him, dangerous for Jericho especially. <sep><sep> As Mrs. Talate said,"To return to our Chagos, Diego holds the key". <sep><sep> Olivier Bancoult replied that it is not their British nationality that matters to them. <sep><sep> According to Ashok Subron, these are his professional activities, that is, personal. <sep><sep> The boss is quite satisfied, because productivity is higher, meaning that his profits will be higher in these crisis times. <sep><sep> They receive compensation from the mill which will receive the cane that is no longer going into the mill that is closing. <sep><sep> Besides signing my name, I don't know much about the literature-writing business. <sep><sep> That is to say, the Prime Minister's term begins from Parliament, not just from remaining in power since the Rain. <sep><sep> The second thing, it is surprising, that in such a period. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As time went by, he began to discover different remedies for different illnesses. <sep> <sep> We find no response, no objection to our policies, so we say, "What trouble we will give him, we will put on our site." Then we inform a certain number of people, inviting them to read what he has written. <sep> <sep> Later, in the afternoon, they will find a sign outside, in this corner, where there are a number of photos showing how stevedores were loading cargo long before the time of shipwrecks, bucket by bucket, loaded onto ships. <sep> <sep> The MSM has withdrawn and has found opposition from the MMM in a Remake 2000 alliance. <sep> <sep> We can understand all the twists and turns of politics that are happening day after day. <sep> <sep> They oppose the detachment of Diego and the construction of a military base. <sep> <sep> That is, the working class itself must understand international politics and develop the capacity to criticize the diplomatic policy of their own country, and confront this policy in practice today. <sep> <sep> A Selection Committee will only be used on the condition that its mandate specifies that communalism must be removed from the Best Loser system, or the Best Loser will be drawn fairly. <sep> <sep> And since the 1950s, it is almost always the Labor Party that has this historic bloc together, and the bourgeoisie has the block. <sep> <sep> When there is a Grand Bay explosion, the Prime Minister's Office and the Police do not issue any official statement for 10 hours. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are certain types of products that are being exported. <sep><sep> All this will tell him that 20,000 "people" have not arrived in the seas. <sep><sep> For example, just recently, Nad Sivaramen was named as the Editor-in-Chief of all publications from the L'Express group. <sep><sep> He also said that he does not understand the controversy. <sep><sep> Our association that promotes the mother tongue, acquired knowledge only last week from a professional survey that we commissioned last month. <sep><sep> Worse still, it leads us to find only the most possible capitalist system. <sep><sep> It is not only complicated, but also complex - in all concepts, in all arguments found in Marxist theory. <sep><sep> That same evening, after a bank and a lot of toasts, Governor Gridi Krazkor was sleeping in a drunken stupor. <sep><sep> All this indicates that we have a structural problem. <sep><sep> But we, the Class Struggle, we already know all these delegates. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The decision of the MSM/MMM to give full immunity to the President of the Republic in the name of individuals in the Electoral Supervisory Commission and Electoral Boundaries Commission, is also worrying and could lead to institutional crises in the future. <sep> <sep> Since the establishment of classes, in the last 5-10% of our history, there have been contradictions, conflicts, violations of conflicts, even bloodsheds, domination of the dominant, exploitation of the exploited. <sep> <sep> There are also ecological issues that take bio-carbon without adding to this food crisis of today. <sep> <sep> From its Jean Lebrun to the introduction of mother tongue in the first adaptation by Mist 75, the different wins have already been seen in relation to free education. <sep> <sep> The police system has been detrimental since colonial times, as it saw its role as defending property and dividing colonizers, and preventing vagrancy and marooning. <sep> <sep> Since our birth as a LALIT de KLAS group in 1976, we have been consistently fighting the nationalist lie of the MMM, with its Lel Gos who favored a collaboration between a bourgeoisie section, to fight against imperialist forces. <sep> <sep> And you don't find individuals appearing in this kind of turmoil often in towns. <sep> <sep> When he gave us this perspective, it was clearer. <sep> <sep> The youth is not too visible, but it is still quite dramatic. <sep> <sep> On the issue of closing the mill, during the strike, the Government announced that the Solidarity and La Reunion mills will not close. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ramesh had organized a family outing in LALIT Bambous starting with him for security, and allowing him to continue in the villages when anyone powerful had attacked him. <sep><sep> Following a question, Ram Seegobin said that LALIT's initiative to demand an inspection by the UN on Diego Garcia for nuclear, it's a long process. <sep><sep> It runs through complicated paths, such as offshore, IRS processes, etc. <sep><sep> Since 2010, when we had a series of committees that set up a launch of proposals for electoral reform, we have a fairly clear and public position. <sep><sep> The speaker really seems to believe that he should have known how to read and write Creole naturally. <sep><sep> Such a disaster underneath where to start breaking down ollifera. <sep><sep> - Wow! This sunshine area seems like a blessing on my paper. <sep><sep> And his mandate was to democratize the economy, his mandate was to "put people first". <sep><sep> This is the result of 2 different factors: according to the World Trade Organization (WTO), from January 2005, there will be no more quotas for any country for textile products: <sep><sep> As long as it is his system, the worker will not get all his rights. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the Mauritian Creole language is entering schools as a subject today, and as a subject of study, it is very important that we all become active participants in its different "rescues". <sep><sep> "I will also present what we are in CTSP, us, what we think; what we expect from a political party. <sep><sep> That's why we are in LALIT, we want to expand our party, expand our network. <sep><sep> So they put the title "report", this book, "Democracy Crisis". <sep><sep> It was about time for him to come and inspect and later chief inspector. <sep><sep> He told me like this, "Here, the meeting breaks" - we started at 6 a.m. - break 9 a.m. <sep><sep> Creole in Elections: LALIT Victory In February 2011, Alain Ah-Vee on behalf of LALIT wrote to the Electoral Commission for advertising that the electoral notice collected in all schools when there are elections in Creole. <sep><sep> There are people who still think that language is just a technical means of communication or a cultural identity phenomenon. <sep><sep> But there are matters that the Israeli government is reconsidering - not sure if they will revise the mirror again. <sep><sep> The remake has managed to finalize their common position on electoral reform. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday in Europe there is Great Britain, France, Italy, they are all still in the trap of debt, like Greece, Spain, Portugal. What does this mean? <sep><sep>  there will no longer be the same scope and price guarantee to designate that former colonies like Mauritius have flourished and exported, primarily to Europe. <sep><sep> When we have disagreements with the MMM, GWF, it bothers me. <sep><sep> Economic crises are worsening on a global scale, the government in Mauritius continues with an economic policy that is highly dependent on foreign sources. <sep><sep> Usually what is in a collective lawsuit, it is said beyond what is in the will, meaning they are more than the will. <sep><sep> As soon as they enter into the witness box, they feel a little odd. <sep><sep> Now, to prevent this meltdown they are looking for another 700 billion dollars, to create an "object" space. <sep><sep> For some time, we have been hearing Ministers propose a few solutions to the various problems here, putting people on board, in ships, planes, send them elsewhere. <sep><sep> Too bad the life that was given to me when nature was being stingy by not letting me become a mother. <sep><sep> During this last 7 months since the last LALIT Seminar, we have experienced a series of events that have affected society in general. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today, with all that is being said, all development related to the mother tongue, all discussions related to the mother tongue, the Creole language we observe. <sep> <sep> The idea to boycott USA sweets was born in November last year, the month of November. <sep> <sep> And the fight against police brutality, brought with so much courage by the victims and their families regrouped in JUSTICE, it will continue. <sep> <sep> Ecology studies mean looking at interactions between living organisms among themselves and with their environment. <sep> <sep> The results of this survey show that Israel's strategy to isolate Gaza with a blockade more severe than the current one in place is not well received by its inhabitants, who are rising up against Hamas. <sep> <sep> There is no doubt that the case that has been brought before the Court in London has brought more international attention to the Chagos issue and made it a prominent international issue. <sep> <sep> However, this action is not a measure that will bring an end to the problem. <sep> <sep> From 1975-82, where we were heavily involved in the MMM and very active in the trade union movement. <sep> <sep> He always preferred to play football with his brothers and cousins who played at home with his sisters and cousins. <sep> <sep> During the strike, there was already one demand. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In April 1996, the Pelindaba Treaty was adopted after a conference held in Cairo. <sep><sep> We contributed, as LALIT, in many ways. <sep><sep> Now it is possible, despite all these obstacles, to go on a strike that is legal, after you have taken a vote, after you have obtained a majority, to go on strike. <sep><sep> The boys say it's not true and just trying to scare him. <sep><sep> Here, the violence that we are facing with their fascist arguments. <sep><sep> When we finish paying our water and electricity bills, finish buying gas, finish paying rent for housing (or renting a place to stay), set aside money for transportation, school fees, and other essential things, a large portion of expenses goes to food. <sep><sep> I believe this issue is right at La Chaumiere, it is a problem that finds the entire problem and all its goals, and it finds them at the same time. <sep><sep> Marx found a way for the working class "power" (a State) to put his own law into place, for example. <sep><sep> But since the trade union federation hasn't been united. <sep><sep> 1 olive oil bottle we had broken made 60 kg of olives, which equates to 16 liters of olive oil. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He said that Sithanen’s budget is ultra-liberal. <sep> <sep> It’s not naive to call a bourgeois state a “bourgeois” state. <sep> <sep> It was clear that it was not a white night. <sep> <sep> they have mentioned the possibility of a Mauritius-UK partnership on the Chagos question (Le Quotidien, 20 Sept 07). <sep> <sep> VOH says it is financed by certain "persons" without specifying. <sep> <sep> Why is LALIT conducting this “Lye State” on political parties? <sep> <sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who was in a Conference in Ahmedabad, Monday against militarism said the conference was a success and where present had almost 200 people. <sep> <sep> For example, the British people have their country Great Britain (Scotland and Wales as well, but they are just as few, less powerful). <sep> <sep> It is this Best Loser system that makes each Minister believe that he represents the entire population when he looks at its dossiers, but that he is only there to promote a communal lobby. <sep> <sep> they have never exposed the way in which the MMM-MSM attacked campaign staff. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The new generation of trade unionists is aiming to form a new historical bloc. <sep> MMM was, politically and electorally, the largest party in Parliament. <sep> It only enigmatically wrapped a foundling in its robe, that's all. <sep> But, it says the Best Loser system will disappear by itself. <sep> they reject this ideology, they break this example, even when they are supposed to be in the working class. <sep> a member Ally Hossenbokus participated in the MARON congress in La Reunion, and another member, Ram Seegobin, met with DSP members who went to the World Social Forum in Mumbai. <sep> The bosses make workers pay the price every time there is a crisis in their own system, the capitalist system. <sep> That means, now work will be done 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. <sep> We need to present arguments why union unity is necessary, why programmatic unity is necessary. <sep> There was no magazine to come out in Diego, because we were living well. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Also note that there is a Minister who has taken a favorable position towards this WANTED. <sep><sep> Education for Workers is making a public appeal for witnesses to come forward to tell their own experiences of studying their mother tongue in school. <sep><sep> The opening forum was divided into 3 parts: the first to explain why each of the speakers felt it was important to engage politically, for whom, and why they engaged. <sep><sep> For your six children – Juna, Rishi, Gag, Fiya, Devina, and Lolol – and all your family and friends, we offer our condolences from LALIT. <sep><sep> they are already well aware,

like ACP-CEE. <sep><sep> It lost Rs50 million, but it did not have a stadium, no land at all, no appropriate equipment, and old. <sep><sep> It's worth looking at the "blockages" that existed and still

which he wanted to deduct from his "retainer" money as a lawyer for the bank. <sep><sep> Since the years 1994-1995, when the price of sugar was starting to plateau, the sugar industry has found that electricity production can be profitable as a source of additional income through surplus cane that they sell to the CEB grid. <sep><sep> While it is in French, it restricts the number of people who

union commission, there was a report and a good debate on different sectors such as Construction, Public Health, BPO, teachers, and electrical installations. <sep><sep> In 1993, the Ad-Hoc Committee started discussing other topics such as drug trafficking, the environment, and the exploitation of marine resources along with Indian Ocean security issues. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin explained that there is a need for today's demands to develop alternative economic possibilities. <sep><sep> Prenses Prathna explained that generations after generations, the bourgeoisie have cut trees, destroyed animal homes, and plants and flowers mercilessly. <sep><sep> Therefore, there was all this discourse, resolution and negotiation underway. <sep><sep> The Zini government maintained a bit of a secret about its people, even to Obama. <sep><sep> All this was done, as you would know, to allow Great Britain to withdraw from its piracy in the enclave, while ensuring that it can sell Chagos to its "Big Brother", which, in turn, becomes a reseller. <sep><sep> This Commission also began in Congress in February. <sep><sep> It is the private sector that gets contracts for all this infrastructure work. <sep><sep> How there is a system that has almost total control over every production, on almost all the resources of our planet, on technology where the minimum necessary gets done but cannot guarantee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that the resumption of the deposits can lead to exactly what MMM and PMSD are saying it has. <sep> <sep> There needs to be a strong mobilization behind a program that involves not just a vision of a new society, but the starting point of the arrival of this new society. <sep> <sep> 60% of doctors are women, and 65% of students are girls. <sep> <sep> at the same time with Israel and as diplomatic work for the African Union take a solid start. <sep> <sep> There has been a significant swing since MMM-MSM-PMSD, which lost 9% of the vote, vis-à-vis Labor, which has seen a 13% increase in its vote. <sep> <sep> The importance of workers and unions (alabaz) is to consider the employment issue in a way that is not uniquely sectoral, and especially not only to consider the same category of workers who will no longer lose in some sectors. <sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin introduced the size by saying that Lalit has chosen to launch its campaign and its Alternative Economic Policy program at the same time as the Some Sides organized by the United Nations. <sep> <sep> In the past, the majority of contracts were verbal, which means you have a job, and everyone assumes that you know the conditions, the salary. <sep> <sep> His Stimulus Package and Additional Stimulus Package are not fixing any root causes of the problem. <sep> <sep> The financial system is pulling in a large amount of money, without anything being produced. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It's not just Amnesty, but many people make mistakes in finding the state as independent since the class conflict in society. <sep><sep> In particular, we will also examine how they have coped with this series of crises that have been and are continuing to occur in the country and through the capitalist system. <sep><sep> And even more serious than that is a strategy that would really help in combating communalism. <sep><sep> At the same time, as Reeaz says, people here are starting to flounder, starting to lose ground. <sep><sep> and more skilled to overturn the capitalist system, and how they embark on the process of creating a socialist system in its place. <sep><sep> So, those 4 mills that remain are at risk of not getting enough cane for those 100,000 tons of sugar they need to produce to cover expenses. <sep><sep> In terms of politics, there is the newspaper Le Militant that the MMM has had, against wind and tide. <sep><sep> It adopts entire villages, sponsors artists, finances NGOs and individuals, gives all kinds of jobs. <sep><sep> In passing, I'm not too happy about my "physical" work that sometimes also serves, because work doesn't need muscle power, there are computer jobs that don't require physical strength. <sep><sep> There must be full compensation and reparations from the British and Americans for all Chagossians who have been uprooted. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Remember all the lives lost in the Israel-Palestine conflict, remember all the people living in Gaza today. <sep><sep> Then you ask him whether he will vote for this or for that. <sep><sep> Due to the lack of access in the colonies, the fire department couldn't intervene. <sep><sep> Rada and Madu and the medicine that helped to heal, Jimmy who helped him to cover, Jean Marie and Georges who rolled the press. <sep><sep> Inequality today is more critical than it has been since the Second World War. <sep><sep> Before this, Bill Duff, the Prison Commissioner, organized an exhibition to attract attention to the difficulties in controlling the prison without a system where all eligible prisoners can be released early. <sep><sep> Since the creation of the Free Zone, there has been a permanent demand to abolish mandatory overtime after 10 hours per week in Free Zone legislation. <sep><sep> However, for GWF, time, transportation was getting worse, and GWF realized that it was necessary to strengthen SILU and UASI. <sep><sep> The Electoral Commissioner takes them, classifies them, based on what they were forced to put on their Nomination Paper. <sep><sep> This is how your vote is not counted as an "abstention", but as a refusal to vote if you are present in this election. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the '60s and '70s, movements for civil rights in America, movements for black people to gain

called Cock-a-doodle-doo, Mister Chicken, directed by French filmmaker Jean Rouch filmed in Niger. <sep> <sep> And this, despite the UPR strike in 1979, and despite the popular uprising of Septam in 1980, which put an end to this deviant attempt. <sep> <sep> This is for the benefit of the Academy of African Languages (ACALAN) initiated by the African Union. <sep> <sep> This international move is not just to make MAI a training camp to show that as Thọưhn, as Marx was saying, there is an international plan, there is certainly international political interest in favor of imposing capitalist domination on the world. <sep> <sep> The general impression is that he does not consider himself Mauritian but Chagossian, and he no longer finds legitimacy for Mauritius to fight for Chagos. <sep> <sep> He elaborated on what he calls the 5 core values, socialism which, according to him, is Democracy, Morality, Social Justice, Economic Realism and Internationalism. <sep> <sep> This is a very important measure, not just for the prison system, but for Mauritian society as a whole. <sep> <sep> But there was another bourgeois ideology we would have liked to mention, especially because it was already part of Lalit. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We have another set of Mini cars that are bringing beds for them to hold political meetings on sexual abuse allegations against government officials. <sep><sep> When caught red-handed, they base it on relationships. <sep><sep> Every year, the ‘United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)’, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, establishes a list, with its rankings, of countries with drug problems based on the quantities they send. <sep><sep> What's interesting, it changes its name to FPU, so that, in a second phase, it can take on other non-state syndicates. <sep><sep> But, the value of the product that will come out, the seeds that will go on sale on the market, when we will know its value, it will include salary, car prices, raw material prices. <sep><sep> Other claims can be wrong during the class fight, even their conscience. <sep><sep> So it is together that we all bring the bed: that it will protect the environment, worker rights, family rights, anti-communalism, or against the occupation of Diego and Palestine. <sep><sep> Then, we get a new "twist" when Navin Ramgoolam announces he will reintroduce late payment, that is to say, apply the backward program of Pravind Jugnauth. <sep><sep> Such advantages cannot prevent memories from coming back. <sep><sep> * D. and I get a lift in a truck-plant to

<sep><sep> We must remain positive! We narrowly avoided a disaster. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, when it came to the 1982 general election, anti-imperialism disappeared completely from his discourse, as well as from his practice. <sep><sep> We have reached the end of this electoral campaign: we have finally discovered what is in the government's program of this Alliance de Lalyans. <sep><sep> The government is saying that businesses need a special permit, and they are the ones who will issue the permits. <sep><sep> Lalit denounces Minister Soodhun who is shamelessly raising xenophobic sentiments in the country in the style of Le Pen against workers from other countries when they demand their rights. <sep><sep> There's only a need to read Dr. Dany Adone and Dr. Fabiola Henri. <sep><sep> It is a type of sugar cane that produces a lot of bagasse because bagasse is needed to produce electricity. <sep><sep> A pre-election survey in 2000 showed that more than 60% of people were against privatization. <sep><sep> And, we have to do it, while continuing to live our lives within the current system. <sep><sep> This is a good thing, but they have not said what they will do if parents don't have jobs and cannot afford rations. <sep><sep> Berenger had to swallow his pride, because he doesn't know his IRA. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Several deputies mentioned in the transcription had criticized Timi. <sep><sep> We need to be so wary against interpretations based on bourgeois ideologies. <sep><sep> More precisely, Jean-Yves Dick went to meet different members of the NPAR and Philippe Azema attended the LALIT congress in 2008. <sep><sep> There are already sectors where people work 12-hour shifts (for example, in the textile company CIEL, where workers have protested in front of TAP), and there are very few families that manage to work in this sector. <sep><sep> In 1981, Gaetan Duval took up the same position at a meeting in Champs de Mars where he said that apart from Americans, there is no other sovereign for little Mauritius. <sep><sep> From 1970 to 1979, there were various small sectoral battles, in some places. <sep><sep> We have talked a bit about "Mauritianism" which overlaps a bit, naturally, but we will focus on "nationalism", meaning the "nation state". <sep><sep> When they all come for their turn to speak, the Ti-koli representative, reflecting a bit, says, "Can I say 'no' here?" <sep><sep> Today, the Government is trying to do something backwards. <sep><sep> So, Lalit opposes such measures, and we denounce the demagogy of the Social Alliance. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is based on the real experiences of many women who were in the SOS Femmes shelter. <sep> There is a class worker section, which is simultaneously in the working class, and can separate itself from the working class to re-establish the dominant ideology - and it does so through its experiences and its memory of the past. <sep> It's a little worse, a little more difficult to work, as everyone knows. <sep> partial elections and municipal elections, a union struggle against popular resistance. <sep> And today, when we look at Berenger once again, a leader who has been uncontested for so long, he is isolated, he is one of the few, always there, always in Parliament, in the Directorate. <sep> But American capitalism suffered 3 serious crises in 1968. <sep> Malfeasance undermines the credibility of this leadership. <sep> Navin Ramgoolam has also raised the issue of ethanol, saying in MAAS that ethanol, not alcoholism, is the main problem. <sep> Also, they are surviving because there are still certain constraints on large producers like Lenn and Lasinn. <sep> We do not agree to "not represent" a party of the people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Nowadays, SMEs are filling the gaps left by big companies that are cutting jobs, but it is a saturated sector and a transitional sector. <sep><sep> The family is an institution without a budget to face such a crisis, but society gives families the responsibility to deal with this "family" crisis. <sep><sep> For Labor Day, facing the crisis that I have described, the unemployment that can never be resolved has faced workers in Mauritius, faced with this crisis, we find that these 3 union confederations, each have gone their own way. <sep><sep> Because of any ridiculous matter, we tried to swallow 40 bananas. <sep><sep> It was necessary to enlarge the house, add a bathroom for the children. <sep><sep> And this democratic institution that will establish a new Constitution. <sep><sep> They say, with reason, that it brings division, it brings inequality in schools. <sep><sep> With the policies that have been adopted in Foreign Affairs, today the Maldives is discussing with Mauritius. <sep><sep> He said that there is a Committee that is sitting to see how to make what Prime Minister Ramgoolam said Mauritius should do in his UN Nation Action speech. <sep><sep> Sister Charity wanted to call him Moses but after reflection, she decided to call him Martin King. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The laws have been passed, for example, there is a Human Rights Bill in England that has passed in Parliament, the House of Lords, etc, where it gives the same rights as, for example, a French citizen. <sep><sep> If the Best Loser system is maintained, the electoral reform process will be flawed. <sep><sep> Until 2008, it was revealed that out of the 1,000 acres of land that the government had taken since its establishment in 2007, which was supposed to be dedicated to increasing food security, only 200 acres were actually allocated within 5 years. <sep><sep> It is continuously turning a sugar sector into a sugar cane sector. <sep><sep> For us in the LPT, we need to look into the future, what strengths do we have? We have found them in our balance sheet. <sep><sep> This is typical of trade unionists seeking support from one sector of the Government against another, one side of the State against another, or even one side of the bourgeois against another. <sep><sep> But the MSPA has refused to accept the reports submitted, and the land that was supposed to be offered for agriculture is now being allocated for legal proceedings. <sep><sep> Every time there is a strike, both delegates clash, and 11 people end up going to court simultaneously. <sep><sep> Salary compensation should be sufficient for everyone, so that those who have less money can cover the increasing costs of living in all aspects of their lives. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And finally, will it be the Labour Party that is forming a new Historic Bloc after the systemic crisis has begun to break the old one? <sep><sep> Starting meal: a variety of ingredients; rice, corn, yam, potato, beans, lentils, sweet potato, peas, fried fish. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have also organized solidarity action, sit-ins in Lebanon and bombarding Gaza. <sep><sep> We need to reintroduce bread, dry fish, and cheese in schools, as some parents cannot afford to feed their children. <sep><sep> This reflection was brought up with a special tablecloth: with an exhibition of paintings, sculptures and installations on the theme "Artists for Freedom, Against Repression" that LPT has been organizing for a week. <sep><sep> The Labour government sees Creole as a medium as a problem for its political satisfaction and as a problem for all types of sectoral lobbies for its electoral interests. <sep><sep> Mauritius's systemic crisis (national level, that is) has greatly affected the protection of European textile and apparel industry - a reminder of huge, great export sources. <sep><sep> The book was already predicting what kind of struggle it would be. <sep><sep> Only when Bill gets to Parliament does the leader of PT-PMXD show his arrogance. <sep><sep> Workers will also start to say that Sir needs to do his part. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The curriculum takes place every Wednesday from 10 am to 11.30 am. <sep><sep> He spoke about the last 25-30 years where there has been a "downturn" in the quality of education, not just in Mauritius, but particularly worldwide. <sep><sep> Everything is controlled as per the normal routine". <sep><sep> He finds it unfair because it is the working class that produces and the capitalist class that profits from it all. <sep><sep> What needs to be done, according to him, is to develop the manufacturing industry to package the agricultural produce, for example. <sep><sep> Take for example, in the recent labor laws brought in by the Government: Sundays have become ordinary working days. <sep><sep> (If you work more than 30 hours per week, you need to seek advice.) 5. <sep><sep> But he does analyze it thoroughly, understanding reality precisely with the aim of contributing towards developing a political strategy to change this reality. <sep><sep> In conclusion, where we have reached now, neither the PT nor the MMM have taken any initiative to launch a true national debate on the need to deepen democracy. <sep><sep> In response to another question on Collendavelloo's proposal to nominate 6 women among the first 12 on the proportional list, Ram Seegobin said that considering women as handicapped is unacceptable. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Anglo-Mauritius Swan Insurance, Smart Card BAI, Valid "in peace and liberty" [picture of a blue sandal]. <sep><sep> We see how all these parties, whether it is PT, MMM, PMSD, MSM, they can no longer address the major problems that Mauritian society is facing. <sep><sep> There is a backdrop of "40 years of incompetence, this suffrage" is on the rise since an SMS is circulating, recalling the anti-Independence slogan of Gaetan Duval in the '60s. <sep><sep> History and Analysis "Plaisance & La Ferme Mixed Farming Society" - Lalit de Klas Review, Mauritius, February 1977, Issue 4 page 17. <sep><sep> and the Electoral Commissioner is becoming a clown under his leadership, and he even announces that the General Election will take place on 3 June, in his First May rally. <sep><sep> The rise of communalist, racist ideologies that weaken the development of the important class consciousness that is necessary for internationalist solidarity. <sep><sep> But today, we will focus more on the "program" issue. <sep><sep> On the other hand, different trade union federations are also facing numerous divisive issues. <sep><sep> Among these 525 families, many were not registered with the NHDC, and if we consider the 26,000 families living on the NHDC layout, it means that there is a serious need for social assistance for the most vulnerable families. <sep><sep> In short, how do the MSM and MMM differ in their ways? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the first 100,000 bananas, we were the only ones looking for fruit, unknowingly, all traces of passion, to run after entertainment or dancing in order to have a big celebration.<sep><sep> MSM-MMM has a policy that allows public funds to enable the private sector to make huge profits.<sep><sep> How do you manage in a world where you need to be able to read and write to be able to debate? Why is it like this? Exclusion? Or genocide by ignorance? ...<sep><sep> There were 150 people present, and this resulted in a terrible weakness in the trade union movement.<sep><sep> After Ram Seegobin presented his paper on "Class Consciousness", Alain Ah-Vee, who was chairing the meeting, called for questions and comments.<sep><sep> They believed I would explain how to manage the "economy" in their family budget. <sep><sep> Between 6 am and 8 am, often on a Friday, 10,000 to 12,000 trucks, and all, all, all of our trucks are in Creole.<sep><sep> Like the Labour Party presenting its report (it has made such progress), and even though the MMM and MSM will not present any reports, LALIT has its report.<sep><sep> During the school vacation, there was a team that was providing assistance.<sep><sep> In the face of political weakness and the Government and the Opposition, the political forces were teasing, they only manage to take strength through farfetched initiatives such as a hunger strike to establish a framework in "middle management". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The conditions for the festival to take place are as follows: <sep><sep> Sometimes we forget what "class struggle" means, so I will, in a nutshell, show the manifestations we see every day of the class struggle. <sep><sep> The problem is that he wants to have a political movement and a workers' struggle. <sep><sep> In the Transport Industry, we find the union agreeing with the tariff increases so that workers get a better salary. <sep><sep> This means that it's a matter of everyday life: popularizing our program within the working class and among all working class allies, i.e. in the women's movement, the student movement, in social organizations or in the farming sector. <sep><sep> So far, I only knew a French setting. <sep><sep> LALIT does not find presenting an identity card as a guarantee against fraud, as giving a biometric identity card can impose fraud. <sep><sep> For some years now, it has been negotiated with President Dany Marie (RA), Secretary Narain (RA), Assistant Treasurer Veena Dholah (RA), but they only have fake unions representing them. <sep><sep> we only change our campaign according to what now allows at least one date to have multiple bans coming. <sep><sep> It means that it's funny, but some scientists in the field of pure sciences are finding it dangerous. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There was a debate on whether everything lacking is a political will. <sep><sep> It's worth taking a look at this list when criticizing the capitalist system. <sep><sep> We have used the Creole language for 35 years in all our publications in Creole. <sep><sep> He led protesters who were arrested in the delegation to go to London. <sep><sep> Under the Labour Government's Bill, employed workers can receive severance pay only if the employer is 'at fault'. <sep><sep> So we find that many other political parties often forget their program, or they pull it out just 2 days before a general election: "Here is our program". <sep><sep> And, partly because in 2005, we underwent a total blackout since the bourgeois press. <sep><sep> Sometimes, the neighborhood committee has terrible demands. One neighborhood committee, in particular, made a claim that stopped the distribution of metadata on our land, demanding it be put on another land. <sep><sep> They broke their 2 consecutive committee meetings that they had just put together, and replaced it with a new committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister Beebeejaun. <sep><sep> So, this led to a completely absurd situation, where a confederation was treated as one of the factions as if it resulted in torture. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> - A delegation of notable Endo-Kreol representatives who had control over the Grand Society Endo-Kreol (GSEK) and had found power snakes in their army, went to meet the Prime Minister to agree on a strategy to regain control of the society. <sep>

Princess Prathna went directly into the blazing carriage. <sep><sep> And also so that people in Mauritius can benefit their fundamental rights to a house. <sep><sep> The Creole language was introduced in primary schools in 2012. <sep><sep> Education for Workers has published an article in the press on its analysis of the work the Morisyen Creole Academy needs to do in 2011, but where it is located in its historical context. <sep><sep> Regarding these Identity Cards that he is discussing, the Prime Minister has already announced that they will be like Singapore. <sep><sep> Ram Seegobin was invited to speak at the Artisans United Organization about the future of artisans. <sep><sep> When the capitalist system enters a crisis period like today, it is absolutely necessary for the working class, small farmers, fishermen, hunters, unemployed, to organize. <sep><sep> And when you negotiate with these 35 bosses where the Industrial Relations Act is, where bosses are accustomed to saying "No!" because this will go to court, and it will take up to 5 years, you'll see that the boss has adopted a culture of saying "no" and continues to say "no". <sep><sep> It is a strategy that has been advocated, developed, put into action in the capitalist class struggle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people who went to "Forum of the People" yesterday asked, "What is this?" <sep><sep> Or is the MMM going to enter the government with one of them? <sep><sep> They make so much noise that they are almost like a movement. <sep><sep> And if you want to have the best possible understanding, go to the Privy Council. <sep><sep> And in 1982, when we left the MMM, it was definitely on the basis of the disagreement against communalism that the MMM leadership had made, when they allied with PSM. <sep><sep> It is also the same time that the initiatives of Mauritius representatives in America Peter Graig, Chit Jeeseeramsing and businessman Maurice Vigier de la Tour helped to vote for the AGOA law presented by President Clinton. <sep><sep> It will place LALIT in the history of Mauritius, since Independence. <sep><sep> - Become my ministers, my advisers, my ministers-advisers and my advisers-ministers. <sep><sep> We have a quite critical political situation and, defiantly, right after Zizman Balancy. <sep><sep> The leaders, especially Bizlall and Subron, have continued to be in antagonistic relationship. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina give sensitive and strong interpretations of these two extraordinary characters. <sep> According to the Save the Children and East Jerusalem Rehabilitation Program report released in March 2012, 98% of Palestinian children who are arrested face physical or psychological violence during their arrest and detention. <sep> To my dismay, I have been receiving funding for the past 2-3 years with DCP, a beautiful package that is breaking my heart. <sep> Investment in this sector is reporting significant returns, and even Navin Ramgoolam has described the IPP profile as "miraculous". <sep> Today, the employer can even count on communalism, as he can say "we are all in the same boat". <sep> It is not a minority of people who decide to continue the strike. <sep> When Sir Ralph introduced gender management, he did not do it to have women sitting on men's heads, but to use feminine intelligence, understand femininity to consolidate masculine power, the masculine economy. <sep> He also said that there is no way to predict how quickly this economic crisis will impact us. <sep> But it does enter according to AGOA, in the American market conditions. <sep> In homage to Neville Alexander, LALIT has paid homage to Neville Alexander on our website, and there is another article in this Review (last article). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the RSP Congress, there were also different messages of solidarity from different parts of the world with which RSP is in solidarity. <sep><sep> There is also a prayer that everyone makes. When the insurance industry is enjoying itself as it pleases, society as a whole is suffocating. <sep><sep> TODAY'S REALITY: THE CURRENT SYSTEMIC CRISIS IS EXPOSING THE REALITY THAT FAMILIES ARE LIVING. <sep><sep> It is a challenge, but it is possible to make 3-4 agricultural production rotations so as not to lose a lot in cyclones. <sep><sep> Parents were digging up a piece of land for their children; farmers were planting weeds that young people were smoking; fishermen were pouring poison into reefs to catch contaminated fish; parents were selling children in the slave market. <sep><sep> But, they want a chance for it to be "business as usual" for all capitalists. <sep><sep> The political situation is inseparable from the economic situation, and like everyone in the world and in Mauritius knows, the capitalist system in crisis, or rather a series of crises, may be worse than ever in its 250-year history. <sep><sep> "And I will also comment a little on the relative absence of reaction from the trade unions and industry unions. <sep><sep> And it is only a profound reflection on where we are going that can change something if, after that reflection, we take appropriate actions and in a global way. <sep><sep> when one evening he was hanging out (without much experience) on the railings of the Royal College Port Louis, we heard his friends cry "Bure! Police!". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In each family there is someone in the family itself. A neighboring country's leader knows someone well imprisoned in Negev prison. <sep><sep> It is important that we build working class strength as a whole, without making anyone believe that there will be someone who will come to save the workers. <sep><sep> It is in this context that in the Third Non-Aligned Movement held in Zambia in 1970, at the proposal of Sri Lanka, a resolution was adopted for the Indian Ocean to become a Zone of Peace, where there would be no military bases. <sep><sep> Our strategy and tactics also link one to another in our ideology and our program. <sep><sep> Today, Saturday 12 May 2012, we are demonstrating in front of the US Embassy in Port Louis to denounce the presence of the US military personnel in the Port Louis harbor, and starting from yesterday, an American warship. <sep><sep> First, it was loaned to the Minister of Education for a decade. <sep><sep> And this year, the Resistance and Alternative political party, the people who left the Lalit 1-2 organization, have submitted their Nomination Paper without involving the community. <sep><sep> It must be acknowledged that the Sadou was providing him with a lot of information. <sep><sep> So they avoid the "middlemen" who charge very high prices. <sep><sep> The family has a division program: all kinds of work for women, equal schooling, clean water in taps, new marriage-divorce laws, decriminalization of abortion, stop violence against women! <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Economist Schumpeter developed this and named these cycles the "Kondratiev Cycles" after an economist executed by Stalin, who discovered them: <sep><sep> This means they are fighting against poverty by uniting their class, or trying to reclaim communalism. <sep><sep> In the Sugar Industry, the European Union is planning to reduce prices of sugar imported by more than 37% in the next 2 years: Europe has gained 10 new countries, and will need to revise its agricultural subsidy policies. <sep><sep> And today, many political activists see this recovery as a strength. <sep><sep> Even if sugar and cane have no future, union leaders continue to defend not only the interests of their remaining members for immediate gains, but also the interests of employers to continue operating their mills and planting their cane. <sep><sep> It has also made it clear that the MASS, which in effect is the Government Plan, is completely and ludicrously in favor of the sugar oligarchy. <sep><sep> And we have found that there is a well-coordinated effort going on with the PT deputy, and PT candidate, and even the Minister of Labour like Shakeel Mohamed, and even with the Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam - in this conflict with the sugar bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Now, when it comes to talking, myself and a comrade, for Lalit de Klas, are already being watched behind the scenes by the Delegate Assembly, which is organizing the GWF, Lari Moka. <sep><sep> You fish, you break, you ask, you might get a Mercedes. <sep><sep> Many candidates coming from the working class are excluded from the democratic process because of this exclusion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ram Seegobin has said that the alliance between the MMM and its leader, as well as its colour and symbol, are quite difficult to interpret as a symbolic alliance. <sep> Take another service to go to Checkpoint Huwarra. <sep> Where every individual makes decisions on where to invest for the future, and how much, and how much to use to navigate life today, and how to organize work together? <sep> to include Creole and Bhojpuri, 2 mother tongues of Mauritius on the list of languages acceptable to the Registrar. <sep> The Palestinian people have not taken any lessons from the new Obama administration. <sep> So, what have these 2 relatively new labor laws been? <sep> Others, like support for their advancement, even though indirectly it was helping them advance. <sep> Meanwhile, we will look at the work we have done, are doing, and will analyze it. <sep> And now, will it impose taxes on housing in the country? <sep> Moreover, the problem of rising prices and the threat of shortage in supplies, the Lalit campaign is for an alternative economy to gain a new lease of life. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> and Brazil, they need to sell their air routes on the world stage, outside of preferential routes. <sep><sep> Former President Cassam Uteem, yesterday, gave a moving speech that recounted the historical conflicts that make a Palestinian today a stranger in his own country. <sep><sep> This planter did not want to go into exile out of cowardice because he didn't know what to expect coming back. <sep><sep> Paul Berenger is largely responsible for the rise of communalism with his "divide and rule" policy. <sep><sep> On the basis of the points below, 8 organizations have raised their voices against the GMO Bill that the MMM-MSM-Green Party Government have brought to the National Assembly. <sep><sep> Unity against the British and American people against their government. <sep><sep> It seems that workers (and especially our members) don't become President, but get absorbed into this sick bureaucracy. <sep><sep> Report: The army has passed a law before 4 pm. <sep><sep> You should have known that the decision won't move forward. <sep><sep> When in 1993 there was the first "communal deal" (50% reserved seats in Catholic schools against the containment of oriental languages in CPE results). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often we find one department boss being pitted against another department boss. <sep> He announced that he was beginning a "secret" strategy. <sep> He had written it while in prison in 1915 in Germany. <sep> If the MMM is not succeeding in mobilizing people as before, it is simply because it has no real rallying point. <sep> * Develop a slogan, meaning a way to say a demand in a way that is so urgent that it reflects the complicated theme in meetings, publications, flyers. <sep> ​​And divide it to show what slogan it represents. <sep> This year there will be a "4-Day Training Course in Adult Literacy Teaching" on 8 - 11 April 2006, at the Mother Earth Building, GRNW. <sep> Possibility that the situation was not appropriate (in resistance terms) for this occasion. <sep> Small SMF and fizi soldiers, tell him "You don't have the right to enter!" He says "Why?" They say, "No, a restricted zone, you don't have the right to enter." He says, "Okay, got it. <sep> As for the May 1 Movement, it is still the same, despite Bizlall's statement that he is going for "auto-elimination". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Workers in public service positions are resisting the PRB report that claims they are not proposing necessary compensation to address the increase in prices in Rodrigues compared to Mauritius. <sep><sep> All governments should increase pressure on the Rajapaksa government to force it to negotiate. <sep><sep> This means a "political program" that is like the articulation between parts in a machine, but it articulates ideas. <sep><sep> What methods are there to strengthen, recruit new members? <sep><sep> There are many laws that honor the strength of labor, for example, we know there is a "minimum wage". <sep><sep> Workers are looking for loopholes everywhere, always pushing what is strong, things were moving so slowly that they had to put a brake on rationality. <sep><sep> Yesterday, they had chosen to start their march at Immaculate Conception Church to ring at noon, at the 12th stroke, and they planned to arrive at the Cathedral at the first stroke at 1:00 pm. <sep><sep> The SSS already has access to all kinds of surveillance, tapping, espionage, and there is a risk of having access to all this private data. <sep><sep> And this affair could have allowed Mauritius to become offensive against the British government on the issue of Chagos and tip the balance of power in its favor. <sep><sep> Read the article of Rada Kistnasamy on the Bush policy that disturbed many editors, which is the environment with its signature on the Kyoto Treaty (paz 172) that is financed by private sectors like Enron and Andersen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They will try to reverse the direction of the MMM, take control. 
<sep><sep> I will investigate historically, and then follow the evolution up to now. 
<sep><sep> -Klan Boolell, where Arvind Boolell recently publicly declared his intention to "legitimately" take PT leadership when the time comes. 
<sep><sep> We have finally decided to meet with people, inform them, and publish what Jack Bizlall has written on our website.
<sep><sep> He concluded by pointing out that even if this story is told in a somber atmosphere, it is a book that brings hope and breathes life. 
<sep><sep> In the past 2-3 cases, it has been said "We need to wait for new editions, the cases have ended." This means that the civilian case is taking time, even though Valayden in 2006 had promised a "fast-track". 
<sep><sep> for example, one on the soleiums of the last years in Lafrans, one on recent events by John Pilger, and another on advertising and its role in society. 
<sep><sep> Their solution to the somaz problem is shadow companies, circular migration, and the expansion of tertiary education in Mauritius to solve a ten-year drought. 
<sep><sep> Dr Dodlo said that one of the reasons why many children do not understand scientific concepts is because they are explained in a language that they do not understand at all. 
<sep><sep> In LALIT, we continue with our inter-labor union strategy. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In sectors where there are 2 or 3 unions, if one union wants to declare a strike, it must get authorization from other unions as well, otherwise not. <sep><sep> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that each and every individual is of great importance. <sep><sep> The role of women is to embrace it from both sides and applaud it when it speaks. <sep><sep> If you plant a single variety, you need to fertilize the soil. <sep><sep> This course of action believes that the trade union movement, above all, is essential for bringing about socialism. <sep><sep> It is a reality that we live in and must deal with. <sep><sep> So today we are in a moment where everyone knows that everything is unstable, everything is changing, and the capitalist system is in a deep crisis. <sep><sep> This means that without fail, individuals in the working class live on a salary, meaning they sell their courage to other individuals with power (and money) to buy it. <sep><sep> But meeting with them, even separately, was allowing ideas and information to circulate through discussion and exchange, like a drop of dew in a pool of water, bringing a slight change. <sep><sep> It is good that I remind all present comrades what the Prime Minister said to the United Nations General Assembly last year, "our independence is not complete until we have sovereignty over our territories in their entirety." I emphasize this "completeness" because I do not agree to have a half solution and to compromise the ultimate goal since all are based on our sovereignty. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After you have other laws where this political-religious phenomenon exists. <sep><sep> How are you approaching food security issues, and agricultural issues? <sep><sep> At the beginning of the year, we had severe fuel shortages against the CT Power project. <sep><sep> It is not the first time that Lalit has led a campaign on the Diego Garcia issue. <sep><sep> While at my workplace, I often receive confusion on many platforms, and I provide an example. <sep><sep> Instead of using fertilizers that are presently harmful, toxic, and can harm both flora and fauna. <sep><sep> Additionally, there is government advertising (not to mention more official advertisements), most of which are paid for by the public through newspaper purchases. <sep><sep> This was a point that Yves raised. <sep><sep> Today, he is silent, There is a serious problem threatening the future of the security industry in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Comrade Rajni: I would have been happy to return to a question Yves posed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He may ask questions, like LALIT is doing, not just about planting and production in the fields, but also about who should make decisions like this in society? <sep><sep> (LALIT held a session analyzing on Wednesday, March 3rd about "What a Constituent Assembly would be like", and about the various forms that Constituent Assemblies have taken throughout history. <sep><sep> At a certain point workers realized that they need to do more than just place 3 crosses on a ballot paper once every 5 years, if they want to ensure a future for themselves, their children, and the society. <sep><sep> The press prefers to focus on LALIT when discussing economic issues. <sep><sep> The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was established by the UK to separate Chagos from the Seychelles under UN A/RES/47/59, 81st plenary meeting, December 9, 1992. <sep><sep> Today, its name is the Islamic State of Pakistan. <sep><sep> Here's what Vidya Golam said in his speech at the launch: <sep><sep> It came out of the WTO, claiming that its Court ruled it illegal to continue receiving economic protection, guaranteeing prices and quotas. <sep><sep> They're on our website www.lalitmauritius.org but they don’t go among the common people yet. <sep><sep> He talked about the need for a fair fight to change the balance of forces for progress in the country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> CEB and the Central Water Authority (CWA) were a bit late, they made a go-slow, they said maybe they'll be coming later. <sep> <sep> Timi had made a decision to go back to DSD (Development San Dominer) and start working in the Kotez region. <sep> <sep> We are skeptical because we know that we are in a time of crisis, in a time like now, so a program needs to be clear, it needs to be based on the reality in the classroom. <sep> <sep> Faith47 is going to be a miraculous series inspired by the Freedom Charter, a declaration in favor of equality and against racism, which the South African Conference Alliance launched in 1955 to combat apartheid. <sep> <sep> There were also end-malonets that were also barracks where the army put people who were in their thoughts, but they were a minority. <sep> <sep> Today in America more than 99% of the press is controlled by the same companies and private corporations, a small number, including behind Bush, that is the "Neo-Cons," as they are called, neo-conservatives. <sep> <sep> Sunday, which was about thirty years ago, there were many diseases. <sep> <sep> Another factor that can determine the strength or weakness of workers' organization is the link they develop with political parties. <sep> <sep> Today, the State of Israel is reoccupying the land it occupied in 1967. <sep> <sep> We also need to understand, and it is important that we understand, that despite the crisis being already serious, political parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The working class still can't figure out which political party PT, MMM, MSM, PMSD - vis-a-vis the working class - it is identical. <sep><sep> What this means is that when the USA borrows money, its interest rates are higher, because there is more risk. <sep><sep> When we say a classless society, we mean a society without bosses. <sep><sep> Members of the Lakaz Movement in Bel Mar are helping to prevent deviations, especially among the officials in the Government who are serving this problem to be resolved with their income. <sep><sep> If the WTO were to conclude with its draft, which it presented, it would mean that the "new issues" would enter the WTO sphere; there would be accelerated demands for minimal national legislation to protect the people. <sep><sep> And publishing a Sart against the Best Loser communal system that we asked the organization to endorse and also a code of conduct for candidates, officials, and politicians for the upcoming elections. <sep><sep> As for ERB Bunwaree, employers no longer have to give a 3-month notice before terminating an employee's contract. <sep><sep> Regarding the Marine Park, the Mauritian government has taken legal action against England. <sep><sep> What Employers and press editorials want to say is that unions need to represent and promote productivity and efficiency among their members. <sep><sep> Additionally, at the local level, there are the same phenomena, which should be prevented. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the context of the importance of this political work on the Diego Garcia issue, in this new era, LALIT is sending a member to participate in a Conference against militarism. <sep> They all enter the park, heading towards St Antoine Avenue. <sep> And how is the exploitation of the ocean not directly provoking its mobilization? <sep> So, when you tell a person that Mauritius is saying, "military law is in force", where will they know what the military law is? <sep> It even uses Rs 60 million from the Food Security Fund to fill this reduction in the CESS. <sep> And another way to find, conceptualize and organize work in the field, the "new system" as it was called, for the labor force, in 1971. <sep> Amnesty Mauritius (or at least Lindlay Couronne, one of its leading members frequently talks about it) finds it this way. <sep> Unionist Jane Ragoo When the trade unionist Jane Ragoo intervened, she spoke about another form of violence against women in the workplace. <sep> But what has happened in the CNT has shown that workers' mobilization can strengthen union work together, when they are only fighting among themselves on a bureaucratic interest basis. <sep> During the 2nd World War, when merchant ships had stopped operating from 1942, the Colonial Government had to diversify its plantations, so that the population of Mauritius would not suffer from malnutrition or even start dying. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, the economic bubble for certain sections of the bourgeoisie leaves an economic bubble for workers. <sep> We're going to see who needs to become a member of the zone card. <sep> Bush made a surprise stop in Diego when he left Lirak on his way to Australia. <sep> But the MMM members are not even bothered by the question of prolonging the truce. <sep> because the "forced right-wing forces" have taken control of communication within the group, and are affecting decisions. <sep> The contract has not been renewed for Mr. Cyril Monty, who was Deputy Minister responsible for food security. <sep> Sometimes when he was looking at all the grimaces, Konntou was getting into serious trouble. <sep> You will find out that the bombatom has not succeeded in erasing creation. <sep> The Police Federation has seized the opportunity when Rama Valayden gave it to him to change his size since the brutality of the police, bring him to the attention of the Communal Attorney General. <sep> But, it is also important to consider people who are seeking a goal. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Groups that feel like national limits and national pavilions, are groups that don't reach an agreement on how to govern, but rather agree on a limit and a pavilion. <sep><sep> BERENGER BECOMES CLICHE WHEN THE'S OVERALL SUPREME FROM TOTALITY. <sep><sep> In Mauritius this scandal has also affected the offshore sector where Enron has registered 43 companies. <sep><sep> So, all that to remind us of Conference, and give it a deeper emotional feeling. <sep><sep> Hospital Group Noel Ltd has projects in Bagatelle, Medine has projects in Cascavelle, Mon Loisir Group has projects in River Side in Riviere du Rempart. <sep><sep> - workers should have the right to benefit from technological advances. <sep><sep> Baichoo, Minister of Public Infrastructure is fighting for its service policy, following the death of people in Port Louis during the earthquake on March 30, which will be added to various infrastructure projects in Port Louis and Nuvel Route, as well as the death of an accident near Soreze, where CNT is on its premises while Minis. <sep><sep> We noticed that PAL is bringing campaigns, especially in Lesid. <sep><sep> Just before we went to walk among the Mazistra, in 1985, and to prevent us from winning, Parliament voted a new law on the Criminal Code Supplementary, which requires "pre-autorization by the police" for the project (Section 88). <sep><sep> Mauritius, before the global crisis, started to perceive its own crisis, as in LALIT we've been analyzing it for 5 years or slightly more: A systemic crisis. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The price of potatoes has increased so much that it has reached 50 rupees per kilogram. <sep><sep> Democratization has two elements: one is the development of new sectors, but especially the decrease in historical bourgeois control over the economy. <sep><sep> However, it is based on these old figures. <sep><sep> in Anapolis, the United States, under the presidency of President Bush, last Tuesday and Wednesday resumed negotiations on a Palestinian state. <sep><sep> PPP will make our country a true capitalist paradise. <sep><sep> The crisis is so serious that Jean Ziegler of the United Nations has said it is a "crime against humanity." <sep><sep> We analyzed in the theoretical seminar the way in which the systemic crisis will disrupt all social classes - the working class, planters, fishermen, petty traders, middle class, capitalist class alike. <sep><sep> In the face of this threat, there are factors that weaken workers and make mobilization difficult: recent measures imposed by the Government have created a conflict between CNT workers and workers of other companies. There are individual representation issues. <sep><sep> I know that currently there are South African multinationals entering Mauritius. <sep><sep> They have the means to do so, and they are the driving force behind the Labour strategy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Supreme Court has granted an injunction in their favor and ordered the Israeli army to redraw the barrier that does not go through the village of Budrus. <sep><sep> The first pressure comes from the family, they believe and tell you that when you are in LALIT, you will not find work or you will beg with others in the family to find work. <sep><sep> Gale Norton, Secretary of the Interior: has connections with BP, Amoco Ford, NL Industries Inc. <sep><sep> Her husband was on a ladder, the army shot and the lady was seriously injured. <sep><sep>We did not receive support, we must say, from most of the union leadership, when we suffered this attack. <sep><sep> On Saturday 4th, Lindsey Collen for LALIT, participated in the Radio Plus program hosted by Nawaaz Noorbux on the question of the Environment. <sep><sep> So, he keeps all his training; he keeps it a "matter" Nation and he makes it increasingly become a "citizen". <sep><sep> So, he wants to say that our party, our cad (that is to say our leadership on all branches, training, communication and mobilization, independently of the bourgeoisie and its institutions, such as the press, radio, etc. <sep><sep> So, it is not surprising that now, a month later, he is saying that what he wanted to say is that teachers can use Creole language orally in the early years of school. <sep><sep> So, even after the IBA case, when Alain Ah-Vee was invited to a Radio Plus program, he had to say a lot about it. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>Several journalists have come together to investigate to get a copy of Jack Bizlall's trail.<sep> His excellence in the field of translating and speaking a foreign language is a skill that anyone

in the working class.<sep> How did the National Union (with only 0.5% of the electorate) and the MSM (which has less than 10%) become the only two contenders in no time?<sep> We will light a candle in memory of those who died in Gaza.<sep> In the Legislature, the Historical Bloc has been appointing dictators for over 30 years and is facing challenges from the street.<sep> And in the CSG case, those who are causing trouble are pretending to be innocent.<sep> By then, you could be part of this kind of power struggle.<sep> There is a Board (for leisure, establishment, hotel), then comes the CEO, then management, then the supervisor, workers with skills, ordinary workers, and then the family who holds power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Whether in East Africa or Russia, whether in Mauritius, in the 70s-80s, there were many protests that were either violently suppressed or were not appropriate. <sep><sep> This means that revolutionary elements have infiltrated all trade unions, in all federations, and avoiding excessive relations and a single federation. <sep><sep> However, it has not yet been used in Parliament as an official language. <sep><sep> They often talked about marriage with him. <sep><sep> We say "No to privatization", and we maintain our stance. <sep><sep> Our proposal is even more precise: equalization of the primary school TU level, the secondary school TU level. <sep><sep> It means, first, the Employment’s Rights Act, second, the Awards issued by either the National Remuneration Board or the PRB, and then, on the other hand, there are collective agreements signed by the union with the employer. <sep><sep> One of the demands we are making is for the government to stop giving permission for textile mills to close down. <sep><sep> Surely, the "Textile Employers' Union" (the organization of employers responsible for the textile industry in general) is charging a levy on textile in local markets to promote an increase in textile prices in shops. <sep><sep> We have not only participated in fragmented activities, but we have also organized activities here: 3 international conferences - twice each participant from South Africa has participated, and the last time, each participant from the 4th International from France came. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In LALIT, we consider the tactics of the government to use the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as weak and not to bow to British authority. <sep><sep> So I am in a branch, a member of the Central Committee and when my turn comes, a member of the political bureau. <sep><sep> The Prime Minister asked them what they propose to do. <sep><sep> Change the law to allow them to exploit the sea bed, good agricultural land. <sep><sep> On one hand, they do not have the same ties with French companies as the Franco-Mauritian bourgeoisie benefits (for example, Séchillienne-SIDEC for its IPP, or Médine "it will" for its proposed incinerator project). <sep><sep> This is something we should all oppose, he said. <sep><sep> To celebrate Labour Day, it is not about entering into competition with bourgeois political parties, but rather holding a large national rally. <sep><sep> Each website of the BDS Movement (Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions) on the internet will have a lot of information on the global campaign to isolate the Israeli apartheid regime. <sep><sep> It is mainly because of this that Lalit refused to participate in the Sachs Commission. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Do we have a Parliamentary Opposition, or just a Parliamentary Opposition for the sake of form? <sep><sep> Did you go to vote so that today he tells you he feels even more powerful so that he can put a stop to the exploitation of the working class even more? <sep><sep> To make the Constitution a model of electoral transparency and to bring a historic change to the forefront of democracy and anti-crime rights. <sep><sep> What PT and MSM represent, neither in favor of the bourgeois sections called historic bourgeois. <sep><sep> Today we note that the time has come for the State of Mauritius to act. <sep><sep> It's a small class, it steals a big big part of everyone's life. <sep><sep> Just like in other Napoleon states, Ramgoolam-fish can threaten the law for "media control" to restrict freedom of expression if the media attacks him too much. <sep><sep> For the power stations that are already emitting carbon, your will to support Assirvaden and Nita Deerpalsing, the same PM. <sep><sep> There is a Power Purchasing Agreement for electricity, where the government and CEB are requesting a review of the guaranteed prices that CEB gives and for the stability of its currency. <sep><sep> Because when it is a system that has a default "yes" when someone proposes a person to join a "Facebook Group" like "WANTED Group", then those 8,000 people are 8,000 people who have received invitations. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We propose that the Minister of Education should offer Creole and Bhojpuri languages as "subjects" in school, just like any other subject, from a child's entry into primary school to their tertiary education. <sep><sep> So, in a political party like LALIT, we need to understand all the difficulties, and we also need to understand that these crises will not stop on their own. <sep><sep> Ram and Anwar will share their experiences from their work in the plantation, especially Anne Marie Couronne, born Jean Marie Couronne, who is known in the Housing Movement. <sep><sep> From the time of Aristotle, passing through Karl Marx, until today. <sep><sep> But now we need to think about how to organize a mass movement based on a program that will allow working classes to adapt to new economic situations, and to face new laws that favor employers. <sep><sep> It represents the voice of the villages that are fighting against oppression, against occupation. <sep><sep> What he thinks, he gives you food, drink, a place to sleep, you can work for him. <sep><sep> And he is no longer controlled by an overpopulated population. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, as he sizes my paper today, the crisis caused by the capitalist system, it not only makes the dominant ideology stronger, but it flourishes, in turn, very popular. <sep><sep> Marx and Engels were studying this kind of social science at that time. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> At that time, people are stunned when the IT was paying low salaries to workers. <sep><sep> This is the essence of LALIT, and if friends were there on August 1st, Lindsey's friend made a paper on the concept of LALIT, it is not a concept invented by LALIT, it is something that happens every day, in all work sites, especially the concept of LALIT class exists. <sep><sep> We are launching a campaign for an anti-slavery law so that employers who do not pay workers for work they have done can be tried as criminals. <sep><sep> In LALIT since 2010, we have developed a better understanding of the "Arab Spring" on LALIT to liberate Palestine which has given us the confidence to organize this series of actions in 2011. <sep><sep> They are bringing attention to whether there is proportionality in the recruitment of police. <sep><sep> If the government does not have a law to compel the Establishment to use all its internal resources, the Establishment may either take people (and stop hiring) in this diversification or it may satisfy its internal needs with partners. <sep><sep> We have taken the Supreme Court to task for stating what we have recorded in the Nomination Paper where it says that the names it mentioned do not corroborate with the community registered, according to it. <sep><sep> This is the second incident I am narrating in the village of Hares. <sep><sep> When there is negotiation, this Joint Panel negotiates with the employer. <sep><sep> Is it true that the Prime Minister will not run in Number 11? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> A member of the Housing Crisis Movement has emphasized the importance of mobilizing for every family to have a home. <sep><sep> He still has 2 and a half years to complete his 5 years. <sep><sep> (meaning a democratic system where we elect a specific monarch, a Prime Minister or a President once every 5 years, and we delegate our power to him. <sep><sep> where they developed, at one point, perhaps the only true cooperative plantation Mauritius has seen. <sep><sep> According to the names of the people on the list, all technical aspects have been done in Larenion. <sep><sep> And, this “block” does not quite represent establishment interests. <sep><sep> It signifies a State that can act independently, in a certain measure, from the economic ruling class. <sep><sep> There is political life which is very important for us to understand, and our former comrades are not calling anymore. <sep><sep> During the general election period, there was also a crisis of legitimacy in a very critical manner. <sep><sep> He has intentions to acquire a new car, a bit better since everyone will call him a bourgeois. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Kreol and Bhojpuri Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Partnership, translation of Tagore's Gitanjali by Bhismadev Seebaluck, re-edition by ICJM Baissac History. <sep><sep> If there is a good social security network so that when you lose your job, you can still live with increasing democracy and freedom in the workplace. <sep><sep> So, it has been a long time since the Workers' Party split from him. <sep><sep> We have, as a single unit, the most known language in the world coming together, along with the Mauritian language, you get the whole spectrum of people who have been deposited within this panel too. <sep><sep> His preoccupation with the IRA issue corresponds to the demand of employers to remove what they call "rigidity" in the workplace. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, as some get richer, the poor get poorer. <sep><sep> In an article in Le Mauricien, 8 October 1998, for example, it says "The slave-owner will triumph if the pattern he wanted to establish persists. <sep><sep> Raddhoa also said on the radio, "I challenge anyone to prove that an innocent person has already been beaten by me. <sep><sep> It is complex at the same time, but, if we sit down and discuss it, it is not difficult for us to understand. <sep><sep> During 2 days, there was a fairly open Congress, and on the 3rd day, a Sunday with more internal activities, that is, for members and sympathizers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> God did not create people to live in misery. <sep><sep> Therefore, this legal battle led by the Chagos Refugee Group represents a victory for the British people against authoritarian decrees. <sep><sep> This also serves to criticize the current globalization, and the institutions that defend multinational corporations (especially American) such as the IMF-WB-WTO. <sep><sep> Otherwise, it is workers, employees, families, unemployed, youth, who will be victims of the economic and social crisis that is looming. <sep><sep> * There are policies to encourage workers to become shareholders in companies, such as in the IT sector for example, which represents another form of workers' organization but under government control. <sep><sep> When it becomes illegal to protect a license, then other companies may import better quality than MCFI can produce, especially since it has become accustomed to a protected regime. <sep><sep> Therefore it is not surprising that the MMM and MSM prefer to focus on fraud and corruption, as they agree with the unjust capitalist exploitation system. <sep><sep> The recent debate was very interesting as well. <sep><sep> Then, it seems that he does not realize what he said, he talks for more than 2 hours without proposing ANY measures for job creation. <sep><sep> Education for Workers is as rare as a black swan. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are bringing a campaign against the new labor law that allows employers to "hire and fire" as they wish. <sep><sep> "Internationalism", evidently essential with globalization, and neoliberalism on one hand, and the crisis on the other hand. <sep><sep> It cannot be said that capitalist globalization is not good, hence the need to do an alternative. <sep><sep> In fact, the working class and the people of the country are the ones who will bear the burden of the crisis that exists. <sep><sep> The call for "National Treatment" (they even shorten it to "NT"). <sep><sep> Young activists work against bureaucracy - let's not forget that there is still a capitalist system in Venezuela and there are still many sabotages against the capitalists without punishment. <sep><sep> He says that he is gathering all the 'creole' leaders together to make the voice of this community heard and promote its own advancement. <sep><sep> 'Adieu kind friends, adieu, adieu, adieu ...' - Yes indeed! Can you feel the text on the sound of the Irish music? - We feel it together. <sep><sep> The central argument of Ramgoolam is that the restructuring of the security industry is facing a reduction of security prices that Europe is imposing, it is a political decision, not simply an economic operation. <sep><sep> So in the end, in different fields, discussions took place in the Program that was drafted every Wednesday. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When Ram woke up, we were with another family. <sep><sep> This allowed him to travel throughout his own life, with his good and bad times. <sep><sep> He will be a peaceful gathering “For Peace in Freedom! <sep><sep> With the government's plan to make Mauritius a ‘Duty Free Island’, we find that the bourgeoisie in the country are positioning themselves with shopping malls to attract customers from tourists coming from Lasinn, Lind, and Larisi. <sep><sep> At that time, there are idealogues, idealogues in firms like De Chazal Du Mee, consultancy firms, Kemp Chateris. <sep><sep> Without asking them, Sunday had prepared a small meal which he put in front of them. <sep><sep> What is it that people have cooked for people, what is it that the big businessmen have cooked for millions, what is it that the politicians are lying to them, are they walking freely. <sep><sep> This is what Ziri said on the site of this international association of ziris, an association started by UNESCO experts on languages, whose headquarters are located in the UNESCO Center of Catalonia, Barcelona. <sep><sep> And finally, we are working on our most important work, we have begun to expose the National Human Rights Commission. <sep><sep> LALIT and all our members express our support for all Sagoians at this crucial moment when rights are being revoked, which seemed at least in principle, to have been rejected by the House of Lords in their Review on October 22. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When she finished her studies, she joined Women for Life. <sep><sep> So, 250 years after the abolition of slavery, we are starting to see an increase in domestic workers. <sep><sep> As the production of sugar cane decreases, the industry is gradually becoming unsustainable. <sep><sep> When there is a socialist revolution, the big question that arises is whether there should be a new type of state or whether the state should be abolished. <sep><sep> And if there are doubts about the expenses in the meantime, it represents an investment in the future of education. <sep><sep> The Government Alliance says "Progress Must Continue"; they say they have a positive balance. <sep><sep> There are elements of the working class, the petite bourgeoisie, the middle bourgeoisie, and even elements of the bourgeoisie who are members. <sep><sep> The crisis we are talking about, LALIT has been warning people about for several years. <sep><sep> Unfortunately, Mauritius always has this Best Loser system, which classifies the population of Mauritius (according to the 1972 census) and candidates. <sep><sep> What mechanisms form this bourgeois state, in practice? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Apparently, it seems our presence has helped to encourage the settlers. <sep> <sep> PMSD today is trying to revive as the voice of historic bourgeois politics, and it managed to double its municipal election ticket quota. <sep> <sep> The market square is bustling with activity and cries of fresh produce! <sep> <sep> There are times, like in feudal times, where great lamas hold people in a state of servitude, a form of slavery, or when there are people who are fighting against this, against slavery. <sep> <sep> A stubborn person, wanting to sell, believes in a god who can kill everyone when he wishes and where he wants. <sep> <sep> Bulbak: Okay, but give me an example of what kind of thoughts you have: a personal demand, or a general principle? <sep> <sep> And now, you are all saying strongly that all the oilseed plants in the sugar industry need to be reproduced. <sep> <sep> And hence, all the punishments proposed by these Selection Committees were instead meant for the benefit of the punishers, which is good to see they failed miserably. <sep> <sep> We are looking at it as a current phenomenon in everyday life. <sep> <sep> Following these internal debates, the Catholic Education Bureau has started a truly historical work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before that, many of our activists have helped us with the Housing Movement. <sep><sep> Now it has become a billion insects here, two billion there. <sep><sep> But, when all the people in the country are such perverts, like parasites. <sep><sep> How significant is it that the majority of people in Mauritius use Creole or Bhojpuri at home (93% according to the 2011 Census) but all official language have been excluded since the National Assembly, since all Ministries and almost all official institutions? <sep><sep> The information in Revi Lalit de Klas is not on the internet even though there are million possibilities when we search for something. <sep><sep> * We have sent a letter to organizations in the UK and US so that they know what has happened in Diego Garcia and that they also join campaigns to urge their governments to stop the illegal occupation of Chagos and to close all military bases on Diego. <sep><sep> People who notice this feeling that they are in presence of a person who has a special light that nourishes their soul. <sep><sep> Now it is almost too late, when the establishments have even started investing in all kinds of energy production with bagasse which worsens the problem, now the Establishment and the Government, finally, all together, with a 20-year delay, are panicking. <sep><sep> Then, tighter than that they went to Port-Louis and also second, they do not have a program, their only program is 'On our name'. <sep><sep> And my "transitional" has a very specific meaning. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Now, the trade union leader is going further: he is almost a licensed director who challenges his regime. <sep><sep> The more they try to suppress, the more they refuse to be silent, the more compensation from the Israeli government becomes stronger. <sep><sep> I think that's what Paul Berenger was often saying in 1979. <sep><sep> But like a poet, he was sowing seeds with the hope of finding a new life corner one day where his blue heaven would rest. <sep><sep> And to address Yves's first question, first, as a key question today: Why this class struggle platform. <sep><sep> He spoke about the many individuals who have sent their creations to the 5-6 literary competitions that LPT has organized since that first competition that gave us the book "Ti Bato Papye". <sep><sep> MSM has 11 deputies, but without its leader, Pravind Jugnauth who suffered defeat in Rose-Belle Vieux Grand Port. <sep><sep> The soap opera Paloma rather addresses social barriers for the French-speaking woman and not just pretending like the film is looking for. <sep><sep> To conceal the reality of class inequality, social inequality in society. <sep><sep> Food prices are increasing and there will be shortages. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are 2 strict leaders: one from Brans New Grove and one from Kirpip. <sep> Paul Bérenger has quickly offered to help Navin Ramgoolam with this explanation. <sep> However, the USA has undermined this, due to its powers, especially its military power. <sep> Secondly, we find that this proposition, involving A (Collendavelloo) and B (E.L Shing), has certain things in common: <sep> It is not about manipulating the trade union movement, but rather having an open relationship. <sep> We need to monitor the situation in Marda and Hares to understand what the military is doing. <sep> Think about when it was happening: during the French Revolution, which at the time seemed like a bloody farce, followed by wars between 1793 and 1815. <sep> De L'Estrac has now started to deal with this issue. <sep> In the office, Ram Seegobin posed a question to the Electoral Commissioner, whether there was anyone looking to declare him a fictional electoral commissioner. <sep> By the time we listened to Nita Deerpalsing, Shakeel Mohamed, Cader Sayed Hossen, Alain Gordon Gentil, and even Navin Ramgoolam, they were all speaking out against the establishment but in favor of a new emerging bourgeoisie. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Supreme Court should have intervened in the case where a client Yousouf Mohamed had filed a complaint against the Lalit candidate (and 2 other parties) after the Nomination Day for the 2000 election. <sep><sep> Given that the government has signed the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights where Article 15 gives everyone the right to benefit from scientific progress. <sep><sep> In 2010, during an interview in Le Dimanche (11 April), former Vice-Prime Minister, Prem Nababsing, said today he has become "At the very least, you need between Rs 1 or 2 million". <sep><sep> It's a major event here: a way to say that life goes on and children are looking towards the future despite the violence of the Israeli army's occupation of Palestinian land. <sep><sep> When, for example, the IRA law was voted in 1973, it was full of anti-trade union repression, a lot of State Terrorism; <sep><sep> Every time a trade union movement has organized a demonstration, it separate. <sep><sep> Throughout a long struggle, these obligations that society has, they have become rights, no longer a charity. <sep><sep> - The Prayer? - How may I help you, uncle? - Me, me, I... <sep><sep> And the question of tultan res flu: is there any connection with the Basin Blan crime, where the victim was being accused by other people involved in the case of blackmail? <sep><sep> He said that what the government is proposing today and what the security industry is suggesting is wrong - he used the English expression "Throw good money after bad". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is what we call "class consciousness". <sep><sep> So, we need to support our call for agricultural diversification, where, and resist the propaganda of establishment elsewhere. <sep><sep> A 4-year-old boy trapped our hearts by showing off a wooden gate in his sandbox on the first attempt to defend it. <sep><sep> It is not surprising, that the PMXD and its ministers, the MR and its ministers, all have the same electoral support as LALIT, meaning between .5 and 1%. <sep><sep> Since our existence, we have done a lot of work mobilizing based on our program and often we do not need to go to parliament to get deals, to win victories based on our program. <sep><sep> But it is a political reflection pro-capitalist economy that these parties have endorsed. <sep><sep> Because of the monopoly of decisions that employers have on the economy, on what will be planted, on what will produce. <sep><sep> ISM, a Palestinian movement founded in October 2001 and resisting the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine by Israeli arms. <sep><sep> This means once again 'profitability' for the mining industry, by allowing windfall gains for establishments. <sep><sep> The new Local Government Act recognizes the potential existence of such Councils. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the past, Timi, like all mOrion ti p apel li, became a symbol of feminine-plural life. <sep><sep> But what happened is that PT lost its working-class appearance. <sep><sep> And then if you start talking about a socialist system, a system where there are no bosses, there are many trade unionists, they prefer you because they will support you technically! <sep><sep> He does not represent the interests of the very capitalist goal. <sep><sep> A 15-year-old present and past from different sectors of work listened to Alain Ah-Vee and Lindsey Collen before. <sep><sep> The majority of Arab country governments have become enemies collaborating with Israel, they too. <sep><sep> But in strategy, there is a second phase: What do we propose, our idea? <sep><sep> This opposition highlights themselves sometimes with slogans (after the devastation caused by cyclones, drug problems, law and order issues. <sep><sep> It is a way to say that there is an alternative to this ultraliberal policy in favor of the employers. <sep><sep> At the same level of the neighborhood, at the same level of work, people can find domination that is felt as a domination “of race”, this. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, when the accountant comes to calculate how much each of us should pay, it's easy, they just have to calculate the total, divide by 68 workers, and make a note. <sep> <sep> At the same time, we must denounce the leaders who have abused power in the union, and at the same time encourage workers to join the union. <sep> <sep> And it is in - in fidelity to the trilateral alliance - that there is the key to victory. <sep> <sep> It brings campaigns and promotes non-violent actions to eliminate the real causes of war. <sep> <sep> WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE OPPOSITION MMM AND MSM TO THESE 2 NEW LAWS? <sep> <sep> The Trade Union Trust Fund has affected nature and the same number of union organizations. <sep> <sep> It goes along with this crisis of the capitalist system, which does not give hope. <sep> <sep> - 'What are you and Sami doing?' - 'What's the matter?' - 'All those things that are bothering you, don't they make you sad?' - 'We had to choose between our love, our freedom on one side and put on the balance sheet the spirit of dialogue. <sep> <sep> but he said that we must organize modern elevators like in South Africa or Europe to allow for quality production. <sep> <sep> In the French Zone, the mills continue to shut down, production relocation to other countries continues, workers in other countries continue to suffer repression. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He also spoke about the situation in Morocco where there is a deep concern for the victims of the Israeli government, but this concern is passive. <sep><sep> There are two major meetings, one in Port Louis where there is a Remake 2000 Alliance between MMM-MSM and another in Vacoas where there is the Alliance for the Future between Ptr-PMSD, a big block that is facing criticism due to a series of scandals. <sep><sep> The government of Navin Ramgoolam is unable to defend its economic policy in a fair manner. <sep><sep> The Private Sector Workers Confederation, the Family Liberation Movement and Elan have written to Minister Aimée. <sep><sep> - Rajni Lallah was invited to a Radical Left Network in South Africa to discuss the legacy of Rosa Luxembourg in Cape Town. <sep><sep> It is important to note that some of them, they say, their publications are in French. <sep><sep> The disease of his garden was causing his stomach to burn. <sep><sep> Although raising VAT was not in the Government Program, they did it. <sep><sep> 8. The government must prevent intermediaries (importers, wholesalers, fishmongers) from taking all the "added value"; meaning producers must have access to credit and cooperative marketing; <sep><sep> Therefore, we propose that the Mauritian Government immediately place Diego Garcia and the Chagos on the UN agenda. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In other words, we are dealing with something they, they accuse. <sep><sep> But, when Spring comes, Spring goes, nothing remains, except for strange declarations. <sep><sep> More formal resistance than there is, to follow our example, it is like a radio commentator describing a state funeral of a head of state passing through Royal Road in front of him. <sep><sep> The union leaders must be careful not to notice all this tamasha. <sep><sep> Especially in the world, these were called "show trials", the most absurd moment in the defeat of the Revolution that the working class had brought. <sep><sep> They don't know, often they don't want to know, what a union is. <sep><sep> And when we understand this "class struggle" that is operating in this industry, that we can propose strategies that will lead progress for the mass of people. <sep><sep> The media makes believe that the actions of a Party like LALIT have no effect. <sep><sep> Now we are experiencing another wave, where people are embracing concepts like "Mauritianism", "national unity", "we're all in the same boat". <sep><sep> There was debate on how this mobilization should not depend on the press. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> GWF has been growing for the past two years, and in FPU there are leaders who are starting a new Federation. <sep><sep> This ideology of the right-wing has grown exponentially, taking a different approach from the advancement Karl Marx made when he unified everything into one theory, in one form. <sep><sep> 6 weeks ago, the army started provoking the youth in the neighbourhood where he lived. <sep><sep> all women and men, from the village, the countryside to the city, who participated in the literacy movement <sep><sep> When the Worker says "we must share", he is not just talking about sharing anything with the worker, no. <sep><sep> But, if one day a party representing another class, for example the working class, becomes influential, and if its power has certain values and if it does not just want to be taken over by the bourgeoisie, it must have a class strategy to change the natural power. <sep><sep> He spoke at the national debate on violence in 1994 during the The Rape of Sita, and the second great debate 10 years later, when Sandra O'Reilly took her courage to denounce the 2 gangs that had raped her. <sep><sep> We recognize all this human effort put into the work and action for the native languages of the people of the Republic of Mauritius to flourish and grow. <sep><sep> Then you get the classic class struggle, through the unions, the economic class struggle through unions, where there is a constant struggle between a boss who wants to increase his profit and a worker who wants to improve his living conditions. <sep><sep> Now they have 2 legal cases: one in the Privy Council and one in the United Nations Human Rights Committee. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It seems like it occurred during the mobilization of DWC and the Fiz exam, this Forum-Debate has clearly given MMM and MSM a platform to engage in demagogy in front of union delegates, in order to make people forget that these two parties represent the political right. <sep><sep> It allowed people to write in Creole, read in Creole up to ten thousand people. <sep><sep> He doesn't even know what the children are doing. <sep><sep> In its first 150 years, it had some terrible crises: crashes, crashes, crashes; the bank was crashing too often, everyone was losing money. <sep><sep> This program includes an analysis of the reality in which we live today, it requires transitional policies that have the potential to increase class consciousness and political consciousness, and to work to popularize this program. <sep><sep> And LALIT may be expecting a certain response, which we already feel, for our politics, and for our party. <sep><sep> And it exists, but here we don't recognize its value. <sep><sep> Once again, the bourgeoisie in Mauritius is very happy, it sells its T-shirts, sells its bras, everything correct. <sep><sep> Lalit was the first party to denounce this abuse through a letter addressed to the Electoral Commission. <sep><sep> Why does Jack Bizlall believe he can present himself at a forum on "violence against women" when he himself is an aggressor? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, another young candy maker, as I mentioned at the beginning, from 1990 we have put much more emphasis on developing international contacts and an internationalist strategy. <sep> <sep> We were saying that it is necessary to propose a radical alternative in politics and economy, an alternative that questions the future of the sugar industry itself. <sep> <sep> It fits into all its official visits abroad in a primarily communal perspective. <sep> <sep> Today, after Zizman Balancy, journalists and others are becoming more vocal against communalism. <sep> <sep> Then, in recent years, we have had a collapse in the estimate in which the public has kept the political parties. <sep> <sep> In LALIT we note that the Ministry of Education must succumb to the pressure to introduce native languages into education. <sep> <sep> We are all a little annoyed because since this morning and till we return from the meeting, we have heard many tearful plane crashes. <sep> <sep> The meeting had planned anti-Bush protests for a few AGOA (Africa Growth and Opportunity Act) that was happening in Mauritius, and for which George W Bush was supposed to attend. <sep> <sep> All four seats that MMM-MSM controls completely, they are in the City. <sep> <sep> No one has had time to pick up the jeep number. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the other hand, with a MID policy in the current system, ecological degradation will continue and worsen. <sep><sep> With the British Government, with its economy, with its austerity measures, from what I know, it is complicating the international community. <sep><sep> There are a series of examples where the use of international capital is being used to prevent historical bourgeoisie from becoming totally dominant. <sep><sep> In recent times, there have been very serious crises, but they too, tightened their belt in Europe. <sep><sep> We would greatly appreciate it if we could have a meeting with you to discuss what we can do. <sep><sep> - Here it starts again! So, where are you going, Bandook? <sep><sep> We make an appeal for the news of this proposal to spread widely; to actively work towards ensuring that all parties in the world adhere to this initiative. <sep><sep> This is a first reference where the origins of this initiative were in ancient Greek and Roman times. <sep><sep> This means never manipulating unions, never manipulating union leaders. <sep><sep> As part of the Victory, our fight for mother tongue in schools and in the National Assembly begins <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are too many members of the national assembly who do not have a direct mandate from the electors in the constituencies. <sep><sep> But just a week after his great speech, Netanyahu announced the construction of 1,100 new houses in a colonization project in East Jerusalem. <sep><sep> In the context of the Lalit campaign, if readers in Mauritius want to learn more about our film on an alternative agriculture, contact us at

beyond its own profits: it is not interested in bringing about more equality in services. <sep><sep> And the crisis has been aggravated by the wasting of money by companies supported by Europe that were supposed to be used by the Mauritian Government to revive the entire economy so as to cushion the crisis announced. <sep><sep> Finally, if you tell me there is a boat there, I'll leave immediately. <sep><sep> For more than 6 years, every new wave of crisis has confirmed our analysis and shown that our proposals represent a true alternative for the working class and the poor people in Mauritius. <sep><sep> The abolition of village elections is allowing Berenger to manipulate a "pro-regime live force” system in each village, as was the case in Kenya during the period of the repression of the Arab Spring. <sep><sep> In the past, even in the UBIW, which now has spokespeople who are strong and sit on the ground, often speaks with many newspapers, even UBIW in the past has already agreed to raise bus fares for workers to have a better life. <sep><sep> But for workers and trade unions to strike is to be able to negotiate with more equality vis-a-vis employers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And also this remarkable ability to integrate the experiences of other struggles in the world (the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, the struggle in Ireland, the hunger strikes of Bobby Sands in Ireland in 1982) with the struggle in Palestine today. <sep><sep> Indeed, these ideas are much more organized than we think. <sep><sep> Moreover, in the 80s there were regions that were developing rapidly and young people in agricultural areas were eager to experience the pleasures of modern life. <sep><sep> Lastly, are these struggles not delaying the process of revolution? <sep><sep> Just like CEB, CWA and other para-statal bodies, they can all end up the same way as Telecom, completely under the control of France or another imperialist country. <sep><sep> Perhaps this possibility was not present in the past. <sep><sep> What is true is that MMM does not really offer any alternative political solution. <sep><sep> After much explanation, drawing and branches rolling on the ground, they eventually agree to let me out of South Africa. <sep><sep> Overall, millions of kWh were fed into the national grid from Wind Farms. <sep><sep> Everywhere branches, leaves and flowers were full of moisture. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Description number 5-13 were completely PT-MSM, then MMM reported 3 seats in 17, 19, 20. <sep> When Berenger was Finance Minister in 1982, he made a call to the IMF-World Bank, he accepted their intervention with all their conditions to reorient the Mauritian economy. <sep> So historically, the Best Loser system involves 3 things: <sep> If today the Creole language has entered schools, it is not by chance, it is no longer just because an empty, Prime Minister has realized the importance of using the mother tongue in education. <sep> There is a crisis in the government, a crisis that we in LALIT predicted, and we said that an alliance with PSM was a betrayal of the anti-criminal alliance, and it will end the MMM as a force for progress. <sep> Following the decision of the LALIT Assembly on September 4, 2004, the LALIT Youth Commission met as previously scheduled on Sunday, October 17, Port Louis at 10.00 a.m. <sep> The Bérenger government wants to sift through the pool of pensioners, between the rich and the poor. <sep> During the strike, and after the strike, you must be prepared to face the consequences. <sep> In these two classes, objectively (namely cash-or-not), there are conflicting interests. <sep> But inside everyone, Berenger does this because he wanted MMM to enter the government with the Workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When the sugar industry is converted into an industrial zone, what does it mean in terms of jobs? <sep> <sep> The leadership that has been replaced, is continuing a policy of austerity that was imposed before, on the one hand, and continuing to apply repression against all those who resist. <sep> <sep> This by-election, it is being held since the Medpoint case and it was supposed to ratify this court for the government. <sep> <sep> So, in LALIT we are campaigning and we are mobilizing people to reclaim the mother tongue as a medium. <sep> <sep> When Lindsey Collen told the Magistrate that she has never received a summons, the Magistrate just said, "You are here". <sep> <sep> They predict based on real trends that they observe, analyze, and understand the internal logic of history. <sep> <sep> Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth started his speech with an announcement he called "rebalanced growth", meaning shifting the focus from Europe to countries like China, India, Africa, Brazil, mainly for tourism. <sep><sep> There was a revolutionary experience in Russia in 1917 with the regional workers' councils called "Soviets". <sep> <sep> The Ramgoolam government is not moving forward with a Chagos Regional Council! <sep> <sep> We support these points because they are part of a program that leads towards the liberation of humanity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Often in the past, electoral campaigns have not helped in the construction of our party. <sep><sep> Occasionally Yosi was feeling a new health that he had composed. <sep><sep> And yes, if the Minister is cooking for him, supposedly because he is happy with his sister, or not. <sep><sep> Working conditions in the agricultural sector are precarious, it is a sector where there is seasonal employment. <sep><sep> The LALIT party in this election will significantly highlight the economic and social crisis currently occurring: not just to criticize and expose the bankruptcy of the two Alliances. <sep><sep> He claimed we only have 5 mills, if one breaks, the cake will be delayed. <sep><sep> Ram told him that he even had a meeting with Sanjeet Teeluck, who had the administrative files of the regional administration of the Labour Party entrusted to him. <sep><sep> The government is taking money from the National Pension Fund, putting it into labor, buying shares to keep the price at a certain level. <sep><sep> So, our transitional program, while it is addressing today's problems, the problems affecting workers today, the struggle of people today, such as wages, prices, and working conditions. <sep><sep> LALIT calls on all Mauritians to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> One kind of regulation (called GATS) concerns the liberalization of all services in a country to private sector and multinational investment. <sep> Furthermore, it operates silently, like a pressure, all the time. <sep> Everyone has asked what they wanted and finally the government has imposed a single 19% tax, that is 15% from 1st October and then 2% + 2% each year afterwards which makes it 19%. <sep> They say in their propaganda on the radio that they can win the Best Loser Settlement while in their affidavits, they state that if they win it, it won't be a business operation. <sep> Sometimes workers think intellectually, that this is a good union, a good negotiator. <sep> We believe in what Berenger's position is now. <sep> During a downturn, it can give you the impression that you haven't done anything, so many problems have surfaced. <sep> After a period of prosperity, the country has fallen into difficulty just like many other countries that couldn't resist the dictates of superpowers. <sep> Filled with individuals, everyone is here for a different problem except repression of grievances. <sep> On the other hand, they deserved it, they were not appointed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is still a dispute between MSPA and CEB over the price of CEB to be paid for the production of electricity by the IPP establishment. <sep><sep> He achieves a goal in one class here, then a union goal there. <sep><sep> He isolates people from their environment, from their social class. <sep><sep> All this to say that we have a great power, a strong State, which was very strong when this plot against Diego and Chagos happened, when there was a conspiracy to separate Chagos from Mauritius as an illegal condition for Independence, when all this was happening, at the time, we had a very strong State. <sep><sep> Twelve, there is a First May Movement and Resistance and Alternative Movement that is leading a front struggle (sometimes called People's Forum) where they also have a Plan A and a Plan B. <sep><sep> Ragini Kistnasamy gave support to the women's movement in Palestine at a crucial moment where women participate in the political struggle a lot. <sep><sep> Groupings based on the interests of different bureaucracies, this does not mean very far. <sep><sep> For a union to emerge first and foremost above its own sector. <sep><sep> Many people are relying heavily on precarious work, sinking into loneliness, turning to drugs, looking for an escape route, going as far as suicide. <sep><sep> The celebration was organized by the Ministry of Education in the presence of Ministers Steve Obeegadoo and Sanjeet Fowdar, a UNESCO representative. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Education should not only be focused on competition among children but should also aim to develop creativity and expansion of knowledge. <sep> Additionally, the Minister of Education has even refused to meet a delegation representing village councils, groups, and associations from 23 villages in Lesid to discuss the Local Government Bill last week. <sep> This call has not received a great response but instead it has exposed a weakness in our internationalist quality level. <sep> With these measures, namely IRS, facilities for the new type of IRS, grand projects like Medine are possible. <sep> Today there are 22 trade union federations, with 22 different practices, 22 ways to look at quality. <sep> When the knife is sharpened, it makes people more alert. <sep> Remember: Facing these challenges, you are exposing your life, so you need to think carefully. <sep> I have become clever in the art of class consciousness by force. <sep> Harrish Boodhoo has written to the Police Commissioner, and the MMM is calling it the "Skandal di Syek" (when the syek has just begun!). <sep> But, when there is this kind of intervention by bounty teams, all dances become terrible. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Despite the fact that men, even though they have all the weapons in their hands, often panic, lose their heads when faced with major problems all at once. <sep><sep> We have also just found out that Berenger needs to take the trouble to organize a conference on depression to respond to Cassam Uteem, who started the electoral reform in a radio program because he represents a current within the MMM. <sep><sep> And in general, what they are aiming for is to get a better treatment for workers but within the system itself. <sep><sep> To add to this, there has also been some publicity in the newspapers from a company that has a military base contract in Diego, DG Liability Company. <sep><sep> The Documentation Health Center of LALIT is gradually finding itself in an extensive intermediate space where the Education for Workers Association is transforming its old threat of building into a completely new concept. <sep><sep> Someone was named this morning, by noon he was told, "Sorry, you're not needed, we need someone belonging to another community." <sep><sep> Then by early afternoon, we will see their faults by the extent to which they have won and are falling. <sep><sep> WHY DO YOU NEED TO JOIN A POLITICAL PARTY THAT DEFENDS THE WORKING CLASS INTEREST. <sep><sep> female workers were complaining that this woman was acting like a man, she would prefer a man. <sep><sep> 2 of the signatories of this first declaration actually formed the Committee that the Government established, namely Prof. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> It is the central slogans of the "For an Alternative Economic Policy" campaign that LALIT has been carrying forward for the last 2 years. <sep><sep> Now is the time to build class consciousness, this understanding in common. <sep><sep> He has explained the importance of growth because employment depends on it. <sep><sep> And people who need employment have no control over the capital they themselves have produced. <sep><sep> This weekend, more than 100 children were killed in a bombing by Sri Lankan military aircraft. <sep><sep> So, how can a member of the LALIT leadership accept to start taking part in elections, so to speak, from the outside? <sep><sep> There are also negotiations that are politically shaping to strengthen Navin Ramgoolam in his role as a monarch in the making. <sep><sep> In capitalist systems, values are extremely important, and sometimes they are even compromised, and often compromised even, while other possible values - natural values, useful values. <sep><sep> So, whether it's on TV, through our meetings that were one of the greatest success in other elections, through posters, campaign vans, radio, meetings: <sep><sep> That was the time of import substitution, all imports, all those products were being made by the historical bourgeoisie, namely Ireland Blyth, Rogers, Ireland Fraser were the big importers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Bouk U Lenerzi enters the "Don't tell anyone", "Don't tell anyone". <sep><sep> It represents a violent idea, which has developed over 20 years of struggle. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth has been attacked by the opposition and must now come to terms with an MMM that wants a remake not against but with him, but with his father. <sep><sep> There is a deeper pain in Rodrigues than in Mauritius because of the sibling rivalry. <sep><sep> Lindsey Collen argued that not only the time in which we brought the political struggle, which has become central today, but also the time of a more local level. <sep><sep> In the documentary, some interviews were not only in Mauritian Creole but also in English. <sep><sep> PMSD: In the main part, in an alliance with PMSD, which represented a majority mainly not with PT. <sep><sep> It also depends on the support we have in the working class for our transitional program. <sep><sep> At the same time, there is a need to establish relations at the national and international levels. <sep><sep> During this period, there have only been 2 GREAT REVOLUTIONS. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Great Depression, for example, emerged from a crisis of barbaric fascism. <sep><sep> Candidate Lalit, Ally Hosenbokus, 28 years old, an active member of Lalit for 4-5 years. <sep><sep> The second IMF report that comes after the election describes the situation in Mauritius as a serious crisis. <sep><sep> So when every activist analyzes something, he doesn't do it as an academic exercise (even though intellectual levels are extremely high). <sep><sep> So when we have a series of "strategic seminars" to look at the limitations of Mauritian and national identity, to understand the nature of class struggle and study "class consciousness" and "political consciousness", to understand the state bourgeoisie and historical bloc, we have done it especially with ideas to help us develop our political strategy better. <sep><sep> LALIT'S proposal on its implementation is in our education program published in October 2006, and you can get a copy of the program on the website www.lalitmauritius.org. <sep><sep> after his death, by Nita Deerpalsing, who sometimes brings a bit of anti-capitalist propaganda, usually with a strong dose of racism. <sep><sep> This has been a request since the creation of LALIT which we have put off. <sep><sep> However, sometimes in Mauritius, we tend to forget that we are a people living under occupation. <sep><sep> That means mobilizing, yes, in Mauritius here, but mobilizing with an international perspective because that's what will bring us together, that's what will allow us more strength to claim the firming up of bases, to claim decolonization and the return of Chagos to Mauritian territory, and that will ultimately bring justice to the Chagossians who have suffered so much. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That being said, he also, he is not necessarily part of a capitalist society. <sep><sep> This enlightening philosophy that guided Balancy in his struggles was an attempt to weaken the Best Loser system. <sep><sep> When there is no water, there is too much. <sep><sep> The "secret strategy" of the government will not help at all in mobilizing support for Mauritius and isolating the UK and the US - neither in mobilizing support in Mauritius nor on an international level - what it is are the States, the people in different countries. <sep><sep> And the direction of the MMM is starting to talk about a 'National Recovery Program'. <sep><sep> Revolution is taking a stance against mandatory "Bible Studies" in schools. <sep><sep> And this is true for almost the entire country in the world - entering into a series of crises where no one can predict what will happen. <sep><sep> If he violates the law, he must be stopped; even if he is a Minister, even if he is a Member of Parliament, he can't do that! Everyone is equal before the law. <sep><sep> This shows to what extent the tear of occupation makes it clear that it controls every aspect of Palestinian life. <sep><sep> In relation to this, there is much experience in organizing jazz festivals. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This type of situation that linguists like Skutnabb-Kangas described as "submersion," meaning children are submerged in a language they can't read, and they are drowning. <sep><sep> I explained to you that I have already worked extensively on French issues in Mauritius. <sep><sep> There was a policy to unite workers as a class, and with the aim to abolish the system of working for a boss. <sep><sep> Jean Claude Bibi was one of the pillars of this first beginning which is now the Lalit Party. <sep><sep> And Sandra O'Reilly's courage has enabled this balance of power to begin to change." <sep><sep> Supporting a state that encourages micro-enterprises, which are supposed to be magical solutions for employment, when it is found that 80% are bankrupt after 3 years of existence. <sep><sep> The settlers in these outposts are much more aggressive because their situation is not stable. <sep><sep> In this case, there was even a xenophobic proposal to deport Lindsey Collen, because she was not born in Mauritius! <sep><sep> We must not allow a barbaric reign to enter into the void that will be when capitalism collapses. <sep><sep> Economists still do not know exactly how these cycles work, but they reflect a pattern. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You must vote against them to send a message of disapproval. <sep><sep> This means that circumstances beyond our control allow for the possibility of the sanctions we are aiming for. <sep><sep> In a section where there is no individual liability, the employer is putting pressure on a certain number of workers to provide more work. <sep><sep> You can read the documents that we presented on our website. <sep><sep> The government, while licensing civil servants and public employees, has recruited a large number of new police officers. <sep><sep> While using the slogan "one people, one nation," and also elsewhere, under capitalist editorialist pressure such as Lindsay Riviere, who, at the time, was an editor at Le Mauricien and Week-End. <sep><sep> Every day we all contribute 5, 10, 100 rupees, and this goes straight to the pockets of all the companies. <sep><sep> Even in tourism, the number of tourists has decreased compared to the number of hotels that have increased. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam and Pravind Jugnauth are not taking the crisis seriously. <sep><sep> At the same time it is not heading towards a decrease, and surprisingly enough, the editor is blaming all school children because they are not showing proficiency in their mother tongue. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They have likened a language situation in Mauritius to "Alice in Wonderland". <sep> <sep> Does not he was the company supposed to do so? <sep> <sep> On that side, on the level of LALIT, for 2 to 3 years, we have been pulling documents, we are circulating them. <sep> <sep> Tonight, the children threw a party for Timi. <sep> <sep> In turn, the private insurance, encourages private hospitals and private swimming pools to develop. <sep> <sep> 3 ladies, 2 uncles, and 2 donkeys had to return. <sep> <sep> When they returned, each of the two militants had made a Reverse Bak, a Porlwi, a Kirpip. <sep> <sep> Also, there is a political conflict that reflects the interests of the different capitalist sections. <sep> <sep> all our members who year after year have been nurturing our association and have contributed to its development. <sep> <sep> Does if a Democrat becomes President of the US have hope to make progress? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> All this can say that in this context of economic crisis, it could be another element that brings sanctions in tracing the parties. <sep> There have also been conflicts between the direction of PMSD and Minister PMSD Sik Yuen. <sep> Accordingly, in this Trilateral Commission Report, they noted a "serious" matter for those in power: with only popular against the Vietnamese exodus, only the women have the right to. <sep> And it is also the depreciation of the rupee that is largely responsible for price increases. <sep> But, we, as a party, have distanced ourselves from this "WANTED: 15,000 Youngsters to Save Our Future." <sep> MMM is still focused on bilateral negotiations with the British government. <sep> The ideological basis of the democratization of the economy rests on the concept of a socio-economic mobilization. <sep> What did they intend to do to make the Zionist movement in 1917 able to settle in Israel? <sep> But unfortunately, Célimène insisted on putting furniture, all the other things in the house and they are counting on the name Kamla. <sep> Before you go to work, you can sit down in court with them. And he did the same for that. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> For example, Bidze proposed recruiting and giving promotions for 6,600 positions in civil service. <sep><sep> Even a major cyclone that normally brings a lot of water sent fierce gusts, breaking branches like breaking twigs. <sep><sep> 9. Environmental issues have become critical today because there are certain critical issues that can be fatal, non-returnable points that we have exceeded as on the planet's threshold, concerning biodiversity. <sep><sep> Then in the 1948 elections, when the Afrikaner Nationalist Party came to power, they used this political power to create a state bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Much evidence has been put in place to "prepare" for the struggle of the 79s, conscious preparation during a two-year ban, and class preparation since 1971 has become the same. <sep><sep> In villages, no one trusted him because everyone was afraid of him because he was ruthless, cruel and pitiless. <sep><sep> We, 2 members of LALIT who are signing this contract today, have volunteered to go to Palestine to express our support to the Palestinian people on behalf of our Party. <sep><sep> Meaning that once a union has signed a collective agreement with the employer, it is binding on the employer as well as on all workers. <sep><sep> Equipment to help sports clubs and music groups in villages. <sep><sep> He sees his role at work as a customer to sell something he has gone to buy in the West, either a product or a container. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In April, during his speech at the celebration of Varusha Pirapu, Navin Ramgoolam announced that he will resign from his position after the Tamil Temple Federation came to the rescue of CT Power. <sep><sep> Anyone interested in becoming a member of the Film Club can contact Lalit to get in touch with those involved in the Film Club. <sep><sep> This electoral arrangement has already provoked a "constitutional shuffle" where the powers of the President and Prime Minister are redefined to meet the electoral arrangement. <sep><sep> At the same time, another operation is in progress. <sep><sep> The Labour Government has also entered into major construction projects such as roads, tunnels, drains, and bridges. <sep><sep> It is a strategy that may have worked, but it also shows weakness. <sep><sep> Paul Berenger becomes the opposition leader with the support of 2 PMSD deputies (including Eric Guimbeau, who left MMM a month after the election). <sep><sep> Therefore, it is quite possible that in Mauritius, given that abortion has been partially decriminalized, doctors will be able to perform abortions beyond the current limits (medical abortion). <sep><sep> Our reasoning is that it will lead to the improvement of education in general for all children, through cognitive development. <sep><sep> On this military point, and as in the Conference on Nonviolence, does the GRC oppose their military base, which serves as the basis for all this suffering and is still causing suffering? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We analyze this type of experience in a way that we learn while being militant. <sep><sep> We also found strange things like in a meeting in Septam, where the RA union did a vote of thanks for Labour Deputy, Nita Deerpalsing, for the support she provided in industrial relations in the Security Industry. <sep><sep> But, like children, I was still making the same jokes, like when Zezi speaks in Latin with his friends when he goes to sleep, etc. <sep><sep> And he is always inside the working class, so he can be a motor for this power. <sep><sep> We need to stop all GMOs that are made for profit. <sep><sep> All this has been done to hold a big protest in front of the Sun Trust building. <sep><sep> There are harsh penalties, where everyone here seems similar, with small penalties here and there. <sep><sep> A spontaneous movement quickly becomes a physical force. <sep><sep> It is a very interesting start that begins with the words: Every man is a man. <sep><sep> Unified branches, involving branch members in local activities – like recruiting new members. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this has also contributed to making it easier for the bourgeoisie to regain control of the working class welfare. <sep><sep> For Diego, Paloma needs to go back to where she was, without making any progress on her own, and progress only in her own little world where snakes infest around the lower floors and the reserve lies for the upper floors. <sep><sep> When we finalized our proposal, we addressed our program to the parliament deputies to initiate a debate on this terrain. <sep><sep> LPT wanted through this Exhibition to provide a space for artists to express their desire for freedom, and to resist repression. <sep><sep> Then it becomes easier to transfer those skills they already have in their own language (which they already know) to a second or third language afterwards. <sep><sep> So as to have a safety net combining security in the two largest intermediary sectors in employment, and in employment as we all know, we often forget it, it's the way people keep living. <sep><sep> An objective IBL had been failing to do, workers were leasing equipment, and with the help of the government at the time, workers were buying shares from the company. <sep><sep> Yesterday, here in this region, dictators, when they have everything, have also turned into Islamist fanatics. <sep><sep> Since Mr. Jean Claude de l'Estrac, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and anyone else who writes articles in his newspaper, economist Eric Ng. <sep><sep> Back then, sugarcane planters, even large planters were getting concessions from the Income Tax, meaning they were paying less tax than usual. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 2004 and 2006, Lalit activists went to protest in solidarity with that group. <sep><sep> Right there, that foolish idiot in Laswis who bought that land, he messed up. <sep><sep> Conflict with big bosses has been noticed. <sep><sep> Initially, they were all talking about the importance of national unity, about the need to finish off with racist practices, but as they developed their discussions, they began to realize that they were being misled and that society was being deceived by magic, just like many NGOs seemed to adopt as strategies. <sep><sep> In LALIT, we realize that this way, it won't turn into a "mindset sanction" where everyone "consciously" takes up the cause one by one until everyone has consciousness, and society changes by magic, as many organizations seem to adopt as strategies. <sep><sep> Therefore, the Electoral Commission is obligated to respect the Supreme Court's foolproof instructions. <sep><sep> They are awaiting an official report from AI UK (head office) to confirm this and release it to the press. <sep><sep> Also, at the same time, a number of nationalist, anti-imperialist parties, which had some influence in Third World countries, are going bankrupt. <sep><sep> The resolution of this conflict began with the appointment of 2 experts from Hunton and Williams to resolve the contract. <sep><sep> Father Martin King tried to contact the Police Commissioner to find out what had happened, but each time a call is answered, the Police Commissioner is busy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> His grandfather was upset because he thought Timi was setting a bad example. <sep> <sep> We cannot continue with the errors that have been made in the past. <sep> <sep> In LALIT we have continued to develop and are always seeking to maintain a relationship between organizations and movements, where each maintains its independence. <sep> <sep> On the other hand, he says education should expose the nature of the capitalist society and that education should start with discussions on "capitalism or socialism" in schools. The taboo where there is no right to talk about socialism in schools needs to be overcome, he said. <sep> <sep> He can go on for 5 to 10 years, even if there are times when he is really fast. <sep> <sep> LALIT is against the Best Loser system, it is only a political illusion and it depends on political will and decisions to change it, he said. <sep> <sep> The administration in Mauritius is part of a kind of coalition, an alliance between the colonial administration, the colonial power and elements of the bourgeoisie, large landowners, establishments, and big traders. <sep> <sep> Accomplices in dictating our destinies to our children. <sep> <sep> In LALIT, you will also notice that we have many artists, such as candidates, members, and supporters. <sep> <sep> Because let's not forget that Gokhool and even MMM are in favor of competition in society and that is what allows this competition to prevail in education. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> What is important is that, local food production has not increased. <sep><sep> But, there were only 1,000 to 1,200 delegates participating. <sep><sep> It was a system with immigrant workers who could either renew their contracts or return to their country. <sep><sep> Social Class A (i), Class B, C, D, E made no difference. <sep><sep> However, the appearance of the unity class was possible when dividing deep claims and not just claims for a salary increase. <sep><sep> Depending on this, it was also an anti-cyclic pressure. <sep><sep> There were Jack Bizlall and Ashok Subron, two people who were on the forefront of the fight for labor rights, and often asked to step aside, it was not easy to justify. <sep><sep> Timi was a very popular figure in the villages. <sep><sep> The question we ask ourselves is whether Ashok Subron had the ambition to become a technocratic specialist within the union movement, was it compatible with the humility he had as a leader before being a Lalit leader? <sep><sep> For all when the election was over, it was clear that either the party or the alliance had won the majority of seats. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Before the year 2011, during the last 20-30 years, we have seen the rise of world-class contests that have become prisoners of this anti-political web that we had shown you. <sep><sep> During these 4 years, the boss has made a move to break the workers' organization in front of the supreme court. <sep><sep> At the same time, people have had time to discover that Navin Ramgoolam wants to say "democratizing the economy": in fact, IRS guarantees the establishment as Anna, in addition to being for the big! <sep><sep> So there are still ideologies that are advancing and even more ahead than before while holding onto the quilt! <sep><sep> This is what he said his social role was. <sep><sep> Due to our political organization, for us (e.g. in the 1995 Conference, in All Workers' - 1996-99, in WSF, when we went to Mumbai 2004). <sep><sep> And it is also astonishing that this strike, although it is the largest strike ever in Mauritian history, its place in history is not the same. <sep><sep> When you heard his name unofficially, you heard "faithful defender," meaning he defends religion, he's a protector of faith. <sep><sep> From my perspective, I do not see what has been achieved in it. <sep><sep> maternal, organized by the African Language Academy, Academy of African <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the face of a true economic crisis, when unemployment and poverty are spreading among all people, the Government continues its reckless behavior. <sep><sep> Yesterday, this Government has demonstrated this through the mockery of village elections, and is trying to make us believe that there is still a touch of democracy. <sep><sep> MMM has managed to take over many MSM seats in its most prominent strongholds in the city. <sep><sep> Therefore, for you, shifting from one language to another, it replaces a shift from one resistance to another. <sep><sep> Today, on the 1st of May, it is a day where we celebrate the struggle of workers against exploitation and oppression. <sep><sep> The current year has been dominated by economic events. <sep><sep> Remember in the 60s and 70s, there was a nationalist wave at the global level? <sep><sep> It was controlling everything; it was ruling everything; his wife didn't have any trouble. <sep><sep> Everyone was living their lives their way. <sep><sep> We must return the Chagos and it is the Mauritius State that must make Chagos become a "Marine Protected Area". <sep>  <batch_sep><batch_sep> The passage provided is quite lengthy and contains complex ideas, so I will attempt to provide a concise translation below:

<sep> Even though we know the media - newspapers, radio, and television, are controlled by capitalist money or by the state - will not provide much help in a campaign that aims to ultimately challenge the reign of capitalism itself. <sep><sep> Recently, a woman in New York faced it head-on. <sep><sep> So, the question is "Where will the demands for change in a crisis-ridden society lead us in transitioning towards overturning the economic system that perpetuates inequality and oppresses women". <sep><sep> They are taking action in a way that will allow you to walk more freely. <sep><sep> She tells how her two youngest children are still traumatized by what they saw and continue to face their family. <sep><sep> She was never confrontational, never overwhelmed, always had a kind word. <sep><sep> We know she was in a similar position in the top 10% at the beginning and at the end. <sep><sep> Perhaps you will get a pay increase while being a worker in a capitalist system. <sep><sep> We eat figs and drink coffee under the trees. <sep><sep> They began to sow the seeds of Novam, with 6 months to write a new constitution, finally 444 clauses. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But when you are in a party like LALIT, you can address environmental issues in a more politically conscious way. <sep><sep> It is precisely this same decree that was recently declared illegal by the International Court of Justice. <sep><sep> We are reactivating them, another new crisis is unfolding on us. <sep><sep> Just as there used to be a little river, the Bonnevent river, people used to call it, which passed through the boundaries of their land, water was never a problem. <sep><sep> He and S. Moutia are prepared just like a new Minister. <sep><sep> This does not bode well for the future of future generations. <sep><sep> Although there have been two direct questions to Minister Boolell regarding the government's actions on the Chagos issue until the question of Chagos is officially on the agenda of the General Assembly and when it will be on the agenda, Minister Boolell has not responded with great precision. <sep><sep> And especially when Diego is not there to send his rolling stairs and as a surprise to a television. <sep><sep> In any case, Pravind Jugnauth is now installing himself, positioning himself as a future Prime Minister. <sep><sep> All this together, behind an organized working class, he can present a program for working class power. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We are pleased to present a summary of his speech. <sep> The issues are increasing day by day, and the prices of all items in the shops are rising because the rupee is depreciating. <sep> So, let's start with a brief overview of the two main ideas he addressed. <sep> To stabilize politically, he needs to seek allies from upper-class groups in other social classes. Already, we are finding that certain sections of the trade unions in agriculture and the security industry are aligning themselves with established bourgeois positions, on one hand, and with political leaders in power, Ramgoolam and Shakeel Mohamed. <sep> But the ultimate goal of the class struggle is the victory of the working class. <sep> When we went to Mumbai, when we launched No Bases with Wilbert, where comrades like Lindsey took the floor in front of a crowd of 1,200 people representing the entire anti-war movement from Britain, America, France, they were all there. <sep> Often they are misunderstanding the issue of FDI (foreign direct investment), but it is mainly the IRS, Integrated Resorts Schemes, which is equivalent to a slice of land in Mauritius. <sep> We never even managed to meet with them to analyze the results. <sep> This means we will always contrast our "economics" with theirs. <sep> we brought a laser pointer, each of us bought a pair of long bamboo sticks, then we chose a certain spot in the cane field. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After the speech, there was a debate on which manner the employer is trying to change the law so that he can take people out and put them as he pleases. <sep> Especially since the South Africans said that he had to regroup the "true socialist revolutionaries" when it was happening in countries like the Comoros, where they are still feudal, there is no capitalist system, and there is no truly socialist revolutionary party. <sep> Is it necessary, for example, in America, to group "Americanism" or "Japanism" in Japan to combat racism? <sep> We have finished our strategy in the last 2 years. <sep> The price comes at an important time in the long struggle for our mother tongue. <sep> But the resistance was very limited in the past, before the existence of JUSTICE. <sep> - What do you call yourself? - I call myself Prathna? - Prathna? - In a faraway country, on the other side of the sky, Prathna means prayer. <sep> In September, we already send you a copy of a petition and an official letter where we asked for a meeting with you and the Deputy of our region, to discuss our demands. <sep> The compensation that the European Union is making is not at all clear. <sep> Everyone will receive Rs 5,000 at the award ceremony during the LPT Day celebration on Sunday, September 12. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And it's a shame that the Government is saying it's "too late" to agree to take the accompanying money from 2007. <sep> We understand that burning tires is harmful to the environment and ecology. <sep> The purpose of this "Historical Block" was to enlarge the social capital base (to make more people part of the capitalist class that existed during colonization) so that it's not just the all-powerful oligarchy ("14 families" as they were called back then), but to create a "state bourgeoisie". <sep> In Klib, it holds a special place in multiple ways. <sep> When he was getting all that money, no one knew until one day the police arrested him for drug trafficking. <sep> Who monitors? Who pays? Is the work too hard for the young lady? Papa Jamouna has grasped it. <sep> They have the advantage of working in large companies, they're not alone, they have many colleagues but also have a lot of freedom and the boss tolerates a lot of democracy. <sep> The inequality that exists in the country is just in terms of class. <sep> In the context of village elections, faced with such a situation, the Village Councils and Districts should have more power to question the progress that is destroying agricultural land and the environment. <sep> One part should also be able to say that it is NOT doing it, when it's time to step back and when we need to act together with all oppressed classes in a way that we all consciously understand where we're going and what kind of program we're on. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Place her in private insurance, to work in a car rental company and in a clinic owner's position. <sep><sep> Family taking care of the house, children, sick people like family in Mauritius do. <sep><sep> When a shop sets all kinds of prices on its items, people come together and create a shop cooperative. <sep><sep> So, she positioned herself somewhat in "politics", and also "in history", as a possible President of the Republic. <sep><sep> LALIT de Klas represented a force to prevent MMM from deviating from its objective to bring about a struggle in favour of working class and poor people. <sep><sep> For them, class struggle is a national struggle but not in its contents. <sep><sep> If any member of LALIT wants to talk at forums, speak at press conferences, respond to press articles, then the member of LALIT has equal access to information. <sep><sep> And here on my little corner, there is a board called "The Ghosts of Chagos", which Jean-Claude Baissac not only prepared us for this conference, he also made a donation to the board. <sep><sep> So Paloma is an anti-love film where love is not just a social barrier, not even climbing scaffolding or making a hole in a barbed wire fence, it's the type of love that moves you up a rolling ladder, where you have to improvise and take flight. <sep><sep> So, it's a moment where we had to realize that it's a special moment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> According to the Labour Act, if an employer wants to reduce their workforce, they cannot do so without following the proper procedures. <sep><sep> We also appreciate the efforts that Lalit has made in promoting alternative economies. <sep><sep> Clearly, both the MMM and the Labour Party are not truly believed in their positions. <sep><sep> LALIT's campaign has been ongoing since 2003, creating a Program for an Alternative Economy. <sep><sep> In its 5-year Program and Report, LALIT has identified 8 different barriers that exist and prevent individuals from standing as candidates in general elections. <sep><sep> We urge the Government and the Minister to address this issue of Diego-Chagos. <sep><sep> Sometimes he was on a guava tree, sometimes he was on a date palm. <sep><sep> However, it maintains a class language, a socialist language but now the direction of the Labour Party is becoming a direction that comes from a middle bourgeoisie, large planters, large traders, and professionals. <sep><sep> Tonight, together, in the World Philosophical Day, we will examine "family unity". <sep><sep> I also don't understand, but I pretend to understand because you cannot declare that you don't understand when someone is speaking. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So from 1982-83, it was Jugnauth together with the Labour Party, together with PMSD, their blue-white-red alliances between 1983-1987, they ensured the continuation of the bourgeois state development. <sep><sep> The more there is, the better for everyone. <sep><sep> And before the final decision is completely made, but we have already guessed what it will be with a precision, we have already placed the stencil in the machine, making it "disappear". <sep><sep> The people must realize that there is exploitation, and when the crisis comes, it becomes clear. <sep><sep> He goes on a pilgrimage, he officiates ceremonial rites as if he has the title of 'swamiji'. <sep><sep> But you know, when demonstrations become too frequent, too much, when people are not going to work, when they are on strike, when they are asking for a raise, when they are asking for land for farming, we must agree that politicians, governments, capitalists will not dare to let the crowd cross swords. <sep><sep> Some had a vegetarian feast in gourd, farathas, apple curry, and vegetables, everything Kamini likes to eat, but she doesn't know how to prepare. <sep><sep> LALIT and LPT have long been militant and have criticized Minister Gokhool for his bad language policies in education. <sep><sep> And let's not forget, there is a presidential election next year. The picture is starting to become clear. <sep><sep> For more details, you can contact the LPT on 208 5551. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the MMM-MSM Government Program, it was not mentioned that they would abolish village councils. <sep> <sep> It is also clear that: we need to look for another system, we need to challenge this global economic system. <sep> <sep> The second point of analysis that he made is that since 2009, net imports for nutrition have been decreasing. <sep> <sep> to produce energy from bagasse and coal during the daytime as well as only coal during the night. <sep> <sep> The boys went down, took the mountain to go down to Hares. <sep> <sep> His positions have nothing to do with the issue of political favoritism towards capitalists and against the working class that various Governments have brought, nor on the main issues in foreign policy. <sep> <sep> These leaders could even declare themselves "left-wing", even if they rely on bourgeois arguments in favor of "private property", even if they march with bourgeois parties like MMM and MSM. <sep> <sep> He is happy to control his life outside of work as much as possible. <sep> <sep> We were together in the marquee to guard the Mahebourg hospital. <sep> <sep> It is a new law that prevents all kinds of discrimination in recruitment and promotion, especially delaying licensing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Is Collendavelloo's position in the MMM party still unclear? <sep><sep> On Saturday, there was a lively discussion on political education in Curepipe. <sep><sep> At the same time, English was making reference to "the withering away of the State". <sep><sep> To address the problem of "too much democracy" that Carter had diagnosed, there, in the UK and the USA. <sep><sep> There were 12 literacy students who received certificates, and 50 people who successfully completed the Tiychez Training course. <sep><sep> In addition to the ongoing dispute between JUSTICE, Lalit, and MLF, a victory has been reported in the case: 3 MCIT policemen have been suspended pending an investigation against them. <sep><sep> Similar to what happened in the 1970s. <sep><sep> Marx, Lenin, Rosa Luxembourg, Gramsci learned from what they went through, as did their predecessors, the Paris Communards. <sep><sep> Pelindaba is a step forward in the fight for a world without nuclear weapons, it practically maintains and legitimizes the monopolization of nuclear weapons by major powers on nuclear materials, now in our seas and our lands. <sep><sep> Then, obviously, there is a class struggle between the plantation owners and the workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>The leaders, also, are very involved in the new Government. <sep><sep> So our program, it aims to bring political mobilization to the working class in particular. <sep><sep> All these studies show that the mother tongue is essential in children's education in school. <sep><sep> Note that, in the context of economic crisis, when the boss comes forward with his slogan, 'We are all in the same boat'. <sep><sep> It is important to have a clear and honest link between political parties with a program in favor of the working class and trade unions, which represent the working class. <sep><sep> We can see that we can understand about a political party, about its organization, from Marx to Engels, yes. <sep><sep> In the Senate, as in the Congress, there are representatives of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party formally asking to reduce the number of American troops stationed abroad. <sep><sep> Production at IBL has been affected, and a section has been closed. <sep><sep> All recruitment in big banks like Barclays, for example, is based on getting work on 2-year contracts, then they may not be able to renew. <sep><sep> Bizlall found his joy, and he has found his way, he is truly unique. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Once a week, we gather in a meeting we call the "Program Meeting" where full members come together to develop our program, where we ourselves educate each other permanently. <sep>
<sep> Are we witnessing a new rebellion of the rising generation? <sep>
<sep> All the essential equipment for political militant work like LALIT, namely laptops, computers, printers, photocopiers, projectors, scanners, have been completely random, because the water level has risen higher than all the lands. <sep>
<sep> And for Indigenous Peoples, there have been conflicts that have always existed between representatives of the bourgeoisie of the state and historical bourgeoisie), but the bourgeoisie of the state, it is a bourgeoisie. <sep>
<sep> We do not find feudal times anymore, we do not find ourselves in times where there are classes, it is the same. <sep>
<sep> The economic and social crisis that LALIT has put forward during the general election campaign is becoming clearer to everyone: massive lay-offs in the French Zone are continuing. <sep>
<sep> * Hares - we have a curfew at 8:00 pm where the police have temporarily placed a checkpoint at the entrance of the village of Hares. <sep>
<sep> The integration of different opinions has also allowed for a critical development within the program itself. <sep>
<sep> For different topics, there will be a working group of LALIT militants to handle each case. <sep>
<sep> After the Government concession, the student strike that the National Platform had planned for March 30th has been postponed. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> 20% of the world's population consumes 75% of all global income. <sep><sep> There are interesting questions about assistance in currency control and environmental issues in the village of Rosebelle. <sep><sep> Since his death, the Pandora's box had been opened for aggressive opportunities. <sep><sep> And, at the same time, we engage ourselves in the current electoral reform and constitutional punishment, face to face with imperialist goals and private capital on various fronts. <sep><sep> And this led to movements of worker unrest and trade union movements beginning in these years, from the 1930s. <sep><sep> And as Rajni said, we have just gone through this process to produce this 5th Program on Freedom. <sep><sep> According to a UNESCO Press release dated 18th May 2004, it is mentioned that LPT has been awarded this prize "for its adult literacy programme, which places emphasis on women. <sep><sep> Today you can see how colonizing Israelis continue to settle on Palestinian land. <sep><sep> However, what has happened is that Ashok Subron and Veena Dholah launched a personal attack against Lindsey Collen. <sep><sep> Individuals with experience in plantations and processing have shared their knowledge during meetings. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But it was a slap in a vacuum! <sep><sep> There was freedom, there was transportation, SILU, UASI and Central Electricity Board (CEB). <sep><sep> More beautiful, elsewhere, Banndoukland had groups of people who did not agree with the spirit of domination of Toupoumwa. <sep><sep> MLF intended to make it a campaign on the same subject of its "campaign for a good matrimonial law". <sep><sep> Note that there are also half-movements in the union movement that are also excluded from the Bizlall appeal. <sep><sep> One day a toktok group decided to retreat into the forest. <sep><sep> So in another sense in Mauritius when we say “citizens” we sometimes use another word, and people understand it in the same way. <sep><sep> They all met what he had always thought about and that evening it was in their arms' embrace that he finally found a little relief. <sep><sep> So, when the Government takes action, it destabilizes the union movement and leads to internal turmoil in federations and confederations. <sep><sep> Creole-speaking students who studied Haitian Creole language in school, gained as much skills in the second language (in this case, French) as students who were only exposed to French, naturally having more competence in all subjects except languages. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are certain laws, such as Health and Safety, that are supposed to effectively protect workers from dangers at work, such as accidents, poisoning, illness, injury. <sep> <sep> However, people need to realize that there is no other way to work apart from fighting, in a sense, it sounds bizarre. <sep> <sep> Only the twelve strands of wood smoke can purify the air after this kind of fish. <sep> <sep> On the contrary, repression brings other problems and makes it even more difficult to find real solutions to what is happening in society. <sep> <sep> Where we find more violence, where we find more tragedy. <sep> <sep> We analyze systemic crises based on unfairnesses. <sep> <sep> If there is a problem, it is ultimately because there is no clear notion of what the rule of the class struggle is. <sep> <sep> (Average production includes things as diverse as land, tools, machinery, equipment, capital). <sep> <sep> Tell them on Mount Sinai I will find it. <sep> <sep> He seemed surprised, but he kept his mind open: he told me he would check it out. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In recent times, many Mauritian workers have been seeking opportunities abroad, in countries like Canada, Ireland, and Qatar. The workforce is becoming increasingly mobile. <sep><sep> - 'That's right! Don't worry.' - 'I'll make a sandwich quickly,' Sami said. <sep><sep> But he is a dog that knows how to play his role. <sep><sep> This means that any new linear development is all that he is proposing when there is a need for significant investment in the agro-industry. <sep><sep> People were questioning how to develop a balance in work relationships that are based on cooperation between colleagues rather than the traditional hierarchy that favors the boss or employer with no interest in the worker. <sep><sep> During the 1980s, there was a series of reductions in taxes on income, until that tax disappeared completely. <sep><sep> Another achievement is that he was successful in reintegrating Rehana Ameer into MBC. <sep><sep> And the basic question that Diego was advocating for after 1990, has now transformed into a position of principle acceptance of military bases. <sep><sep> Are we starting to reintroduce our programs, strategies, and tactics to face the constantly changing situation, changing daily, weekly, every month? <sep><sep> Today, the European Union, when it examines its sugar and sugarcane import duties from the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, has an exceptional duty. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The situation took a different turn rapidly, and they all agreed: they all said "foul play". <sep><sep> In the Sachs Report, it predicts that when introducing a proportionate dose, it will encourage coalition after elections rather than alliances before elections. <sep><sep> There has also been a military aggression cordoned off against the villages of Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya, and the refugee camp of Jabaliya and Zaitoun. <sep><sep> Bill said that a regular workday could last up to 12 hours! <sep><sep> But, the PRB report remains calm on this issue. <sep><sep> Now, Navin Ramgoolam with his "economic democratization" is facing a historical bourgeoisie that is much stronger than what his father had to face. <sep><sep> Today, there are many people in the working class who do not think about this long-term process, but us, as a political party, this is one of our tasks: <sep><sep> The Israeli government is also in instability, and now they are organizing a new coalition between Likud and the Labor Party. <sep><sep> It will be interesting to follow the elections with this new political configuration. <sep><sep> From the beginning, he had opened a line of communication with Fanfan just like he was doing with Dharam Raj. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Preparation for this action, has contributed to have several major events, during 2004, around the size of Diego Garcia. <sep><sep> By "work" i mean the capacity to spend energy to live, to eat, to drink, for our survival. <sep><sep> Moreover, there is no big difference between the risk of complications between medical and surgical procedures. <sep><sep> And so, they focus on different things together to sell it as an "investment", which is a "bad luck" (toxic, the capitalists call it that nowadays, after the fact). <sep><sep> Nowadays, when these questions are raised, where you need to say what the boss is proposing is not good, for such and such reasons. <sep><sep> Then after that, Remake started again when Berenger withdrew all his proposals on Electoral Reform and announced his collaboration with Ramgoolam, which ended; <sep><sep> FCSOU, GSA and OUA invited members of LALIT, and in the Food Security Front, we worked together with 8 other organizations and 2 federations, FTSP and GFTU. <sep><sep> And it's a form of class warfare, it goes away. <sep><sep> Politics itself is a very common word in Mauritius, when people say politics is associated with political parties, it is associated with elections. <sep><sep> In the early days of Medpoint, it was an opportunity to analyze how MSM benefited from its strength from Sun Trust. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are also united in an alliance together on the basis of common interests in sugar cane and sisal, and from 2010 specifically the Labour Party has signed an alliance with SILU-UASI, Deerpalsing-Subron-Jauffret-Deonath). <sep> The crisis is pushing Ramgoolam to do what LALIT has been telling him to do for a long time. <sep> And they are organizing prosecution against pirates, keeping pirate prisoners, and then using this as a pretext to hire French soldiers to guard these pirates when they come to court at the New Court House. <sep> Diego Garcia and Chagos, maternal language, decriminalization of work and family rights in general, including Palestinians in Gaza, against militarism. <sep> We take Disid Africa, where the law has violated fundamental rights for a long time along with the Apartheid system. <sep> MBC-TV also re-transmits a U.S. Department of State session, Voice of America, on one of its channels. <sep> Soon after, we find - whether it's in Lagos, in Spain, in Canada, in Northern Africa - people are resisting and fighting back, and finally Marx too. <sep> We have proposed this reflection, a Program, where there is clear demand, and where we will mobilize to promote the agro-industrial sector. <sep> We have also maintained a political publication in the Creole language for more than 30 years. <sep> So, we believe that Berenger's position on Best Loser is nuanced. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> But, I am thinking that there is a capitalist system, communalism for tourists. <sep><sep> What did you find? A beautiful enveloped handkerchief in a blue cotton dress. <sep><sep> Another challenging group, there are no democratic means to challenge this existing group, so what does it do? <sep><sep> So when there was PMSD, the establishment had supported it (they had a meeting long ago where they had another radio in French "Lachez vos servantes"). <sep><sep> Against Lindsey it's Wednesday next 19 January. <sep><sep> This paper is for analyzing strict union sanctions during a period of time, and also for a critical look at the role that some unionists have played in those sanctions. <sep><sep> With the crisis, there must be a very high level of unemployment especially in agriculture. <sep><sep> And it's funny to have a sentence that everyone in MSPA is using, the Department of agriculture is using, they're saying that the issue of interest Rs 375 million should be reduced AND THE SAME DEPARTMENT. <sep><sep> When people will wait for him, what's important, just make money. <sep><sep> There are 2 other shots where the music was stopped: when a woman puts on the table on time, another on minimum and we hear them pray: "Ayo Bondye, make Olivye brave against the bed for us! ". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, this "voir dire" is a rarely used legal technique, and when used, it is also rarely successful. <sep> <sep> They have what is called the "Bible Belt," several states in the USA where people mainly adhere to Protestant, Presbyterian, Methodist religions, but there are also some strange religions like Mormons, strange sects, in an extraordinary way, but what is important is the influence of scriptures in the community and in the personal lives of millions of Americans. <sep> <sep> I also warmly welcome all the people who have come to this important Congress. <sep> <sep> And it is not surprising, because despite the law supposedly preventing this kind of combination, Radio One is part of the Forget-de L'Estrac group, and Radio Plus is part of the Le Defi group. <sep> <sep> Creole language in schools, since January, has 3,558 students in Mauritius and Rodrigues who are learning Creole as a subject. <sep> <sep> But, these decisions must naturally be supported, discussed, in the face of financial existence. <sep> <sep> And the role of such a political party is mainly to create (to permanently develop) a political program. <sep> <sep> The Bring the Troops Home movement was influenced by the discourse of Lalit in the Asia Pacific International Solidarity Conference in 2005, and it improved its slogan to Bring the Troops Home from the War and from the Bases. <sep> <sep> Because we are in the same system of economic exploitation, globalization exploitation, it shows the same flaws on the oppressed class in many parts of the world. <sep> <sep> and all his friends went to form little lalit in Kasi. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In every country, there has been established something called “National Endowment for Democracy” since 1983, to make democracy more passive, more centralized, more participative, more mute. <sep><sep> However, there is not much interest in descending the office's bureaucracy on the site, visiting employees, and holding regular meetings. <sep><sep> The government has also increased its revenue through VAT and Import Duty. <sep><sep> But, the modern ecological movement tends to find ecology in a disconnected way since ancient times. <sep><sep> The use of chemicals in textiles is declining: capital is relocating to cheaper labor markets. <sep><sep> The reality is that when we look at proposals A and B, it exposes certain aspects as quite ridiculous. <sep><sep> It aims to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, including the Indian Ocean. <sep><sep> The civil war in Libya, where the USA-UK-France entered, has turned into a trigger for the revolutionary situation in Tunisia and Libya. <sep><sep> In the last 3 months, two Lalit activists, Alain AhVee and Ragini Kistnasamy, have gone to Palestine to participate in activities of international solidarity organizations. <sep><sep> All journalists, for example, are getting lost in this confusion. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When prices rise this triggers a series of increases in the prices of goods for the poor and the workers, because the employers being given a raise in currency value, the inflation brings more prices into their pockets which explains this growth. <sep> <sep> Just after her assassination, we ask "What does LALIT think about the assassination of Benazir Bhutto?" Prepare to take a position on this matter throughout the week. <sep> <sep> The second term of influence gained on MBC TV and Radio, where, they too, are influenced by private advertisements. <sep> <sep> This would prevent workers and their union from resisting this attack on the minimum wage, job security, and standard of living. <sep> <sep> This is a pro-capitalist standpoint, which believes that "investors" should continue to reign, but does not agree with the ultra-liberalism version of Sithanen. <sep> <sep> Where they ended up, just as we heard in the first part of this Conference. <sep> <sep> There will be a midterm for questions and debates with the public. <sep> <sep> Boolell said, "By coincidence, buddy, the Euro is becoming stronger, you can get that." <sep> <sep> Janet, whose mother was in the Communist Party of Australia, has a long political experience, and she gave an insight into her work as a counselor in a clinic that performs abortions. <sep> <sep> This Sunday, LALIT is launching three extraordinary texts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> These are the initiatives our leaders are taking to prepare us for the crisis! <sep><sep> Mauritius is more exposed than any other country, but the Ministry of Finance is not proposing anything. <sep><sep> So if 100 workers in a facility received VRS, they got land that could be used for agricultural diversification. <sep><sep> A girl who makes a boy afraid will never receive a proposal. <sep><sep> Thus using the mother tongue for different subjects, and to develop learning new concepts. <sep><sep> It does not put a price on the value of work. <sep><sep> There are approximately 5,000 bananas on the floor - on a list containing 100,000 bananas. <sep><sep> What is happening in Mauritius is completely typical where we have two economic pillars that traditionally offered welfare; sugar and the textile zone, and it is facing fundamental problems. <sep><sep> But Bolshevism also had many other charms, and these two books are a testimony to the different possibilities that were presented during and after the 1917 revolution. <sep><sep> Since the beginning of this year, we have heard several speeches on food security. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> savedir SILU-UASI, which was taking place at noon, in Baitka in Bambous. <sep><sep> The book has a section on knowledge that already exists in agriculture in Mauritius; on the relevance of GMOs in today's context; on new concepts in integrated agriculture and renewable energy issues. <sep><sep> In the past, it was never on such a global scale. <sep><sep> It is customary to say that there is a strictly oral tradition in Africa. <sep><sep> In the classroom there is a special place where workers can learn. <sep><sep> Our great gurus, who are greater than we thought before this era of "globalization" when it has become "the end of history" and absurdities such as the "clash of civilizations". <sep><sep> He says they had not reflected on the value of their actions in the context of development. <sep><sep> Response from Lindsey: To a certain extent as LALIT, people in the most promising branches need to take a lead, follow that struggle, actively participate in it, and support actions in it, if it's appropriate. <sep><sep> The USA is a paper tiger, stuck in concrete, with a military mantle, but its economic substructure is made of glass and is already cracking. <sep><sep> Some 3,000 real people have become addicts, most of them are YOUNGSTERS. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He explained that for the MLF, taking a stand against military occupation in Palestine is of utmost importance in the global struggle, just like it was important for us to participate in the fight against military occupation in Diego Garcia in the Chagos. <sep><sep> According to him, the WSF is currently dominated by a current in favor of international meetings solely for discussion, not for mobilization, and where multinational companies finance these meetings. <sep><sep> This means that today, when this industry is facing major crises, when it risks collapsing, it will affect society in all its aspects, sometimes in predictable ways, sometimes unexpectedly. <sep><sep> So what will a political party do to turn this contradiction into a political conference? <sep><sep> Since we have succeeded in this struggle, we no longer have this problem. <sep><sep> I agree that water is a human right, not a commodity, so the Mauritius Government must compensate this company. <sep><sep> I will focus on the specific dimension of the struggle for women's liberation during a systemic crisis like the one we are experiencing today, where the sugar and textile industries are collapsing. <sep><sep> But what was General Bhimsen Chandra's position in all of this? He had a reputation as a democratic and liberal person who believed that his supreme duty was to protect and guarantee the constitution. <sep><sep> On Saturday, there was a very interesting debate forum organized by Lalit in Grand River on Education for Workers. <sep><sep> An example of this contradiction is the relationship between workers and employers in the Security Industry. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> If someone finds it too late, they should be able to take a public transport surcharge yesterday. <sep><sep> The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution endorsing the Israel-Palestine Annapolis Agreement to find a solution to the conflict in 2008. <sep><sep> Measures for small-scale sugar planters, they too, are measures that refuse to help small-scale planters and transform agricultural products; are rather giving permission to sell the land they were planting. <sep><sep> Navin Ramgoolam's first reaction was that Proportional Representation and the Best Loser System are not compatible. <sep><sep> Even initial constructions like apartment buildings, shopping centers, IRS, RES in crisis. After the flooding in March 2013, even though there is investment in new drainage systems, it does not create new jobs; it rather drains resources and jobs from the construction sector. <sep><sep> When looking at the list of candidates, besides this MMM Alliance has almost completely finalized its list of candidates, it is true that there are more than half of new candidates. <sep><sep> I still don't quite understand his strictness, how it actually works, this CSR. It seems there is a government institution that collects CSR and then redistributes it. <sep><sep> So, we have a political bench that doesn't give hope. <sep><sep> International Conference to be held in Horl Mama Bul Later, Grand River North West, Port Louis on 30 and 31 October and 1 and 2 November, 2010. <sep><sep> In conclusion, it is necessary to improve the working conditions in the classroom. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Ziz Seetulsing has taken all LALIT candidates, which Yousouf Mohamed has challenged, but in the General Population. <sep><sep> economic reality (which the boss holds, in his World Economic Forum), political reality that bourgeois democracy holds in each country, and social reality - which civil society must seize the opportunity. <sep><sep> He, Serz, was trying to put himself in the crosshairs. <sep><sep> Now, we realize that it was a very fleeting progress. <sep><sep> Rada Kistansamy has gratefully accepted the presence of reporters: L'Express, Le Mauricien, Le Defi, Le Socialiste, Radio Plus, and MBC and has introduced spokespeople in press conferences: Lindsey Collen, Rajni Lallah, and Ashok Subron. <sep><sep> And he only benefits from people with high income, and he does not benefit at all from people who do not pay income tax, that is, the majority of people do not benefit at all from this measure. <sep><sep> MMM no longer has any strategy to create its own “Blockistoric”, as it did long ago (before 1982) in writing and elsewhere; it is just waiting for the PMSD to be out of the government. <sep><sep> But today, I have no intention of making a chronological description of LALIT. <sep><sep> Lottery on Saturday, lottery in a box, lottery at the office, school, hospital. <sep><sep> Among the former MSM members are K.Bhayat, V.Lutchmeenaraidoo, and M.Lacle. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We had a second session after the death of Ben Laden. <sep><sep> And this attempt to rebuild a new Historic Block always sat "when" even if it is not "tennis", also explains how a unionist like Ashok Subron can either congratulate Labor MP Nita Deerpalsing, or Prof.<sep><sep> The first systemic crisis, especially in the Sugar and Textile Industry, resulted from the disappearance of preferential markets for textiles, due to WTO regulations. <sep><sep> It also triggered a new wave of creativity. <sep><sep> The fact that the Supreme Court cannot change a way of life (since the time of Seetulsing in 2000) for a citizen, is a problem. <sep><sep> When the rainy season arrived, it was the sun that was melting the asphalt; climate balances were becoming of poor quality; <sep><sep> Some central points in this debate are the need to ensure that during this transition period, there is still a Workers State, <sep><sep> in other words, whether it is the sea to pump, what to cut, or what to take, the press here will do the same as those capitalist international companies controlled by Fox and Murdoch. <sep><sep> In this report on the Round Table, we found it essential to confront Jack Bizlall one year later, because in a serious international economic situation and where the class struggle has grown and deepened. <sep><sep> In the context of Mauritius with all this confusion, many deliberations, where ideologies in the press, promote creolization, culture and 'Creole' as such a theme can potentially lead to dangerous deviations.</sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The government has given permission for a road that will damage the last remaining indigenous forest in Vale Ferney without any reason.<sep><sep> In the world of Kiba, a first country to establish a medical training, it is the first in the world.<sep><sep> But I found it interesting to point out that in Africa there are also certain great thinkers, great minds who also promoted the same kind of class struggle.<sep><sep> According to a report released in November 2010 signed by 22 human rights organizations, including Amnesty UK, Oxfam and the International Federation for Human Rights, it is noted that despite Israeli government officials making many statements about easing the blockade on Israel, they have not really done much to improve the humanitarian situation inside Gaza.<sep><sep> First of all, it damages the environment, because the chemicals and pollinating insects can contaminate other plants in nature or other crops and GMO crops can eliminate insects that are beneficial to the ecosystem.<sep><sep> Since the end of World War II, Luxembourg has unconditionally supported Israel as a special test for it to prove its military power and that it can continue to challenge the whole world.<sep><sep> So, taking the opportunity, a Reunion, your debris like that, go to a group of workers in the Community Center.<sep><sep> From the beginning of the campaign, there was a special conspiracy to pretend that there is an electorate in this election, it is only between these 2 alliances.<sep><sep> So, there is also a quite permanent political crisis. <sep><sep> And I also finally entered the Hares, the situation was quite tense. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We find that there are various forms of rebellion, resistance forms in different parts of the world, in Arabia, in Europe, in the United States, in South America, in Sudan but at the same time we observe certain weaknesses such as the lack of political coordination. <sep><sep> This way we all contribute together to make our analysis and demands for our national advance. <sep><sep> But it is supposed to represent the interests of artisans, workers, and farmers. <sep><sep> With distribution, there are so many people that it was possible to make the Distributors' Assembly meet regularly and finally the Editing Committee, responsible for the Review, became somewhat like an executive elected by the Distributors' Assembly. <sep><sep> For example, when we look at the IRS and the Hotel sector, capitalist ideologists say there is profit (for themselves), development, and work. <sep><sep> It was on Radio Plus on April 21, June 3, September 26, November 2 (on the Presidential Elections in America), and on November 4 on the Bush Election. <sep><sep> 20,000 students took to the streets to demand decolonization of education, and to demand the use of Creole languages in schools. <sep><sep> But, I try: In one sentence, the show represented all the gifts that jazz music has made "inside", all the gifts that jazz music made popular at the time, little by little, returned to pay homage to Jazz. <sep><sep> And to this day, it can also be said, there are still many debates, many discussions on this subject, particularly on this concept of "alienation". <sep><sep> Last year, the last B-1 bomber that took off from the Diego Garcia base to launch attacks on Afghanistan crashed into the Indian Ocean. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Mauritian diaspora has come out in favor of the PMSD. <sep><sep> When the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, Bhutto, who was supposed to be a "silkilye" political force, refused to challenge the power of the "mullahs". <sep><sep> The Police Commissioner had banned the demonstration that this Platform was organizing. <sep><sep> However, according to international observers in Gaza, Hamas' popularity has not waned. <sep><sep> In Creole, people express this by saying, "This medicine is preventing the wound from growing." <sep><sep> But, at the same time, for a legal strike, one needs to negotiate with the employers to establish what is called a "minimum service", meaning the minimum service that the company must continue to provide in a certain way. <sep><sep> Finally, when Pravind Jugnauth, Finance Minister, grants compensation to himself and his family because he appointed the Education Minister! <sep><sep> For Lalit also, the struggle against the IRA was a period of intense battles. <sep><sep> It's not just a problem of justice, but of value too, but there is also serious supply issues. <sep><sep> Can also be used - 6 am at the latest - as a later start than a pre-school, which means that each brand will have a fixed website. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> (Britain does not accept that since being a member of the Commonwealth can bind. <sep> <sep> I start with the class conflict where it is "individual". <sep> <sep> It arrived after the year 1999, which means that protests based on problems of class get a common interpretation, and the Government responds to that. <sep> <sep> It is a known agricultural method where up to 2,000 bananas can grow in loose soil. <sep> <sep> Although we agree that shooting disabled people is an environmental problem, we know that it is the benefiting companies of the law that the government has passed not to shoot disabled people. <sep> <sep> And editorialists should put this ideology into practice in their journals. <sep> <sep> It should be used to create jobs through diversified plantations and milling transformation. <sep> <sep> Now, the inter-union movement has entered the government Ramgoolam's stronghold: instead of demanding the revocation of EriA and EreA, Minister Mohammed has managed to bring all union sections to stop requesting the revocation of these 2 laws and argue for an "amendment" to these 2 laws instead. <sep> <sep> This is the kind of reform that the current Government is proposing, to make everything "correct" again. <sep> <sep> He finds himself, like all other people, in a class of people in the same situation. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This decision was crucial for Aneerood Jugnauth, as it would pave the way for a new Governmental Program Speech. <sep><sep> It leans towards a "political" aspect which is non-electoral, as LALIT is participating in elections, but its main focus lies in the period between elections. <sep><sep> Felix, My Treasure My Bliss, and Ris-en-O are all threatened by closure. <sep><sep> This kind of movement, purely peaceful in nature, without raising the issue of Chagos in the UN General Assembly, is facing risks. <sep><sep> We must understand the pressure needed to create a new strength that will unite many people for the bourgeoisie's interests. <sep><sep> And when a workers' strike happens, then, religion, establishment, large planters, they all, they gather together against the working class because the working class is seeking a greater goal in production. <sep><sep> Marx, furthermore, developed a theory somewhat akin to Darwin's evolution on nature in a different sense. <sep><sep> The primary role of a union, in this perspective, shows clearly that they are actually interrelated with the capitalist system. <sep><sep> Israel and its occupation army are facing criticism in a context where the Israeli Supreme Court, on 26th June 2006, issued a ruling stating that all Palestinian farmers should have access to their plantations. <sep><sep> At the end of the ceremony, Martin King turns towards him, places his hand on his forehead like a child thanking his mother, and Sir Charity next to Little Jesus, as if in a daze, saying that one day there will be victory over death and to sow hope and love in the hearts of humanity. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This means that the Quran has continued to exist, but only internally among scientists, not in social sciences. <sep><sep> This means that if you have a common reflex, politicians exploit that, and then it becomes bigger and more serious. <sep><sep> In general, we have received less votes than in 2000. <sep><sep> There was a unique unity of thought against the new anti-worker laws (EREA and ERIA), but then a union party agreed to compromise with the NPC and the other party refused, and that led to a first break. <sep><sep> This was to avoid the class consciousness in England. <sep><sep> But, in general, there was not enough energy to go to another level of class struggle. <sep><sep> When I go, it will be to continue what I have been doing. <sep><sep> The great Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish said a slogan that all Tunisians have adopted: "Sit down!". <sep><sep> In Mauritius, in 2007, Minister Abu Kasenally, who was the Minister of Energy, told the BBC that the government has plans to install solar panels on every house to capture energy from the sun and turn it into electricity. <sep><sep> In 2008, the government came up with its plan to support the Sugar Industry with the Multi Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS) plan. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Later, go to the farm, go to the trouble, call it communist, go to the farm. <sep><sep> An example of corruption within the electoral system demonstrates that the problem lies because the government has less room for maneuver to implement a governmental program that is in the interest of the working class. <sep><sep> The MSM's policies, which continue to promote the development of the state bourgeoisie, clearly benefit other elements and groups. <sep><sep> A recent action that allowed us to talk to the media about what we are planning to do in Gaza, and to discuss and explain to people what is going on in Cairo. <sep><sep> When the MSM is in government, it behaves somewhat like the PT, with licenses that protect the state bourgeoisie with it (like Medpoint). <sep><sep> There used to be a lot of commerce going on, as people used to produce a quality production for consumption more directly. <sep><sep> Couldn't the President of the Republic rather ensure fundamental citizen rights with appropriate means at his disposal? <sep><sep> We propose that the government start in MIE, MCA, MGI and the University of Mauritius, a department responsible for conducting studies and research on the Kreol language, and another for the Bhojpuri language. <sep><sep> They have a circle, an informal club called Disidan-Dan-Ton (DDT), where they meet once a month and sometimes at a different friend's house who takes on the responsibility of preparing food while the others bring snacks and drinks. <sep><sep> The government gave them a chance: if they don't fulfill it, their pension will be cut. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is a form of communalism, like the time of Militant Rally, where it is based on the idea of an "authentic Mauritian". <sep><sep> Rennel dirab has also evolved in a context of ecological crisis, and capitalism has taken advantage of this catastrophism: <sep><sep> This first challenge was through a political party called Action Liberale. A political party represented by Edgar Laurent. <sep><sep> Today, because of this mirage, many Palestinian families have been separated, olive trees are no longer being planted. <sep><sep> And if we do not pay attention, in 5 years, we will say "Ramgoolam deceived us, Berenger is saying 'put people really first', Berenger is addressing a good second cause. <sep><sep> labour unions and craft unions (PWU and AGWU) as well as its demass base, as well as 3-4 business establishments. <sep><sep> Surely in another life they did their wrong; sometimes God had another plan for them; perhaps one day they would come. <sep><sep> But politically speaking, he finds it necessary to reassure his susceptibilities to these minorities. <sep><sep> But despite stopping the rule and having government permission to do so, compensation for craftsmen, blueprints, all this has been blocked. <sep><sep> To find its place alongside the "historical bourgeoisie" to form a "full bourgeoisie". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Recently, he prepared a degree proposal for different universities in Africa for an M.A. <sep><sep> However, non-elite goals in the default state are often pro-PTr. <sep><sep> For another 3 months, he will receive 60% more salary than he used to, and in the last 6 months, he will get a 30% increase from his usual basic salary. <sep><sep> Today, this resistance against police violence is not just about victims, and there are no more warnings. <sep><sep> Their system is chaotic, crumbling, and collapsing. <sep><sep> But when you calculate what this means for the working class. <sep><sep> This event gave Dass and his family extra pleasure, gave everyone extra satisfaction. <sep><sep> At the same time, the process of decay is spreading throughout the country. <sep><sep> So, this course seemed to disappear, but it has resurfaced in countries like Venezuela and other Latin American countries. <sep><sep> Another important thing, the whole campaign, when looking through the discourse of the two blocks, checking editorials that usually analyze anything, there have been no criticisms of any communalist parties, or even extremist parties. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The message in Mauritian Creole is because a member of NPAR an established Mauritian residing in Larenyon named Yoga Thirapati. <sep><sep> We are facing a challenge in this modern time, where there is a conflict in Mauritius today between the law and citizens. <sep><sep> Who will join us to overturn such a system? <sep><sep> The offset and color photos were dominating the newspapers and regional newspapers were disappearing one by one. <sep><sep> Village elders would say "if the goods are good". <sep><sep> When the law becomes even more difficult, it directly affects families. <sep><sep> Berenger is also threatening this coalition because he knows that the value of the coalition is mostly due to the MMM's policy - they received 42% of total votes (along with UN Ashock Jugnauth) in the 2010 elections. <sep><sep> Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met with leaders from 38 countries. <sep><sep> Complaints state: Best loser does not affect in their complaints, according to the UNHRC, Paragraph 3.2, the Resistance states: <sep><sep> For example, often LALIT militants on the radio, we have a massive attack (10,000 to 15,000), we call the police. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> After Lacor on Lapes, Trete Pelindaba was the second major maneuver in which the Mauritian government was involved since 1990. <sep><span> Do you think you can trick me? Thief! - Sorry Mr. Jabaljas. <sep><span> This division, which usually occurs between molasses and what is only needed when used as raw material to produce electricity to sell to CEB. <sep><span> Follow up since the roadblock was temporarily closed in Hares village Wednesday night. <sep><span> Did he make a mistake? Did he make a mistake? It was something clear. <sep><span> Like CIEL in Tanzania, Harel and Lagesse in Ivory Coast and this with beef to serve "Everything but Arms" by Pascal Lamy. <sep><span> Were they obsessed with the question of whether Adan had a shadow? <sep><span> In South Africa, we had a relationship with WOSA and contacts with others. <sep><span> Work on introducing a new concept that allows employers to remove employees based on 'poor performance'. <sep><span> -Create/develop/deepen a program that needs to be changed immediately, to create a bridge to the future we want: socialism. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a disguised way, politicians know that the government will not provide services, and they are trying to direct people towards CSR. <sep><sep> We believe that no one can say this about another person. <sep><sep> What is important is to keep the mother tongue as a medium for at least 6 years. <sep><sep> It will talk a little more about imperialist strategies of the Chinese state tomorrow. <sep><sep> We are ensuring that we can integrate this struggle into an internationalist strategy. <sep><sep> In this dance, it diminishes if we are suddenly acting on the basis of a clear, democratically prepared series of program-manifesto-platforms. <sep><sep> Sitting there, all kinds of vested interests which have only taken the environment into account; this has brought about a situation that regroups all kinds of disparate forces, which have received large funding to bring campaigns against this process. <sep><sep> When there was All Workers, there was a Security Industry Commission where comrade Rada Kistnasamy was involved, Veena Dholah was involved, and I was involved. <sep><sep> There was a paragraph in the press about another Bel Ombre hotel that is considering closing due to the bad weather. <sep><sep> We have also had many analyses of the policy of repression, opposition, and union bureaucracy. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They are turning class struggle into dependence on union "gurus", instead of giving workers the tools to organize class struggle, share knowledge, believe in the potential of workers to act for their own emancipation. <sep><sep> In our last assembly of LALIT members, our decision is that if there is a contest in number 8, LALIT will definitely present a candidate. <sep><sep> Those who were lost in the fundamentals, who were digging the ground to find ancestral roots, one day will find clarity, just like St Paul on the road to Damascus. <sep><sep> When one person becomes good, all become good, this is a fundamental principle on which we are building. <sep><sep> However, as a strategy, a political strategy to bring about socialism, it is wrong. <sep><sep> In this context, we find a continuity in a colonial policy to prevent a majority of parents. <sep><sep> In the long run, there is a proposal (even from European Commissaire Louis Michel) to use molasses to produce ethanol, which can be used as an alternative energy source to replace imported petroleum. <sep><sep> A committee is preparing a presentation on the strong points of the alternative economy. <sep><sep> What the Government is actually proposing is a "licensing allowance" for a year, which allows employers to stop paying severance allowance, which was a right. <sep><sep> This paper is to start a discussion on how to organize our political work, to have a dynamic to strengthen existing structures, and to facilitate the recruitment of new members, and training of new Branches. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He did not allow himself to be influenced by anyone. <sep> <sep>At that time, there was a report from all sections of the business sector, where the unemployment rate was 100%, inflation was 70%, and where an additional effort was needed. <sep><sep> This development was of significant value, it was worth Rs 223 million in 2006, and had reached Rs 700 million by 2011. <sep><sep> However, this type of development was causing trouble to the family. <sep><sep> Until now, what surprises us in the LALIT is that the crisis in the Land and Agriculture sectors has greatly affected our colonial heritage, our dependence on sugar cane and rum. <sep><sep> Workers know that for example, in 1978 there was a great mobilization for SILU and UASI to strengthen themselves. <sep><sep> However, LALIT is the first political party to have launched a well-detailed and severe criticism against these two laws when they were first circulated publicly in September 2007. <sep><sep> There were 63 elected and 12 appointed among the candidates who received the highest percentage of votes, based on the proportion of votes for the party. <sep><sep> We also suggest the same as Sithanen, 20 deputies on a party list, a block list and in order. <sep><sep> Currently, there is no stronger advocate for the private sector in the Social Alliance than Rama Sithanen. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> His house and his brother's house were destroyed by a bulldozer. <sep>

<sep> Language is not just a "means of communication" as the cliché goes: it is our template for understanding the world around us and our own emotions, he said. <sep>
<sep> Rajni Lallah I will take exactly where comrade Ram left off. <sep>
<sep> The link between environment and development was widely recognized in 1980, when the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published the World Conservation Strategy and used the term "sustainable development". <sep>
<sep> Before that, both PT and MMM and MSM all believed, or pretended to believe, that European sugar was to re-rationalize the sugar industry. <sep>
<sep> It is coming, the class struggle, but it is important to analyze it. <sep>
<sep> Even though capitalism often has cyclical crises, crises that return “naturally”, crises that restore competitiveness, today's crisis in Mauritius is a systemic crisis. <sep>
<sep> During our political campaign against ERA, LALIT translated the Employment Rights Act (EriA) into creole language with a view to enabling LALIT activists to use it at work. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep>We feel it, when young people are struggling to find work. <sep><sep> The work we did, for example, Lalit de Klas activists, betray the Award-winning sugar industry. <sep><sep> In the 70s, the working class became very strong in terms of unionism, mobilization. <sep><sep> This also shows the need for proper analysis, because the MSM is not too concerned about the establishment, it. <sep><sep> There were testimonies from the laborer Mon Desert Alma, Dharma Heereeah. <sep><sep> How can a country decree a Sea Park on the island of another people? <sep><sep> In both cases, there may be many disturbances, very serious. <sep><sep> A conference on Chagos, State of Lie, a mansion where nu action does not obtain proper coverage. <sep><sep> Because it is an interior system that serves the exploitation of labor. <sep><sep> We need to counter-build scientific knowledge on the knowledge that has been developed over time on planting, breeding, fishing. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the World Creole Day booklet: new great development <sep><sep> Recently, Ramgoolam and Bérenger have responded to all requests to adjust the new municipal classification to meet BLS standards. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee explained how in LALIT, we are working to build a campaign against the State of Israel. <sep><sep> And that they are facing tear gas, concussion gas, rubber bullets, and arrests at the hands of the Israeli Army? <sep><sep> In the year 2012, we made our strategy more conscious. <sep><sep> A female box; a good blend of Balram's elegance and Timi's femininity. <sep><sep> They chose freedom when they decided to move their homes away from Hamlet or Lermitaz. <sep><sep> Given that these multinational companies in seed production (MONSANTO, etc), produce GMO seeds to tolerate their herbicides (poisons) at 99% such as Round-up or transform the plant itself into an insecticide (another poison). <sep><sep> It is very important that we understand that he has no right to what he has produced, he has got money to go buy in stores what he has produced as a group. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, we can say, between MMM is going to take power, it is a much stronger political force than Chagossian leadership (that organized the demonstration). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Military law is a practice within the interior of barracks, in military academies, and in places where soldiers receive training. <sep><sep> It helps to understand the true situation today and the kind of struggle that needs to be brought into Palestine. <sep><sep> In Mauritius, we have not had true agriculture since the beginning. <sep><sep> To implement its first trial, it had gained major support from direct-action activists, especially its husband, Sir Ralph Bolema, who held forty percent of the shares. <sep><sep> Their working style is typically trade unionist - they call on Government Ministers and deputies like Shakeel Mohamed, or Navin Ramgoolam, to get support from Government deputies, like Nita Deerpalsing. <sep><sep> When a person becomes the owner of LITRA, as a worker, they have to sell their shares when they want, when they die, their children inherit the shares, and they can also sell them. <sep><sep> The education system today is not providing most children with the necessary skills in today's life, such as reading and writing well. <sep><sep> It serves as a barrier to prevent people from thinking, to block their intelligence. <sep><sep> With proper training and material production, not all difficulties will be overcome. <sep><sep> It did not know how it would end, but it was certain that any obstacle would prevent the development of an adult relationship between him and the young man who had just become a prisoner in a routine and conflict for the sake of the light that came from another universe, turning its resistance into history. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Yesterday, the crisis of bourgeois responsibility, the responsibility of the former governments, they did not anticipate what would happen in the textile and sugar industries, nor what would happen at the same time. <sep><sep> Two days later, the opposition came with a motion of censure. <sep><sep> It was the Minister of Finance in the MSM-MMM government (2000-2005) who was about to start the VRS1 in the sugar industry. <sep><sep> Since the 2010 conference where we realized a new phase of the struggle where Chagos, we started building a new front together with the residents of Baie-du-Tombeau, the Private Sector Workers Confederation, Sant Goomany. <sep><sep> They have not proposed any concrete plans for Mauritius to deal with the crisis. <sep><sep> In a Brief that the MMM gave to Sachs, he said it's not the best loser system. <sep><sep> If there is progress in the standard of living, and the conditions of workers, it comes from the class struggle that workers bring. <sep><sep> In the past, there were disputes every year, every 2 years, then they sent it to the state institution, then there was a new law. <sep><sep> More deputies mean more public funds being squandered. <sep><sep> It responds to the political and economic system in our country. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> They might not be able to enslave you, but they will eliminate you physically, kill you. <sep><sep> And my lord and I will take action in this campaign. <sep><sep> It is strong people like Ramjuttun and Kuppan who come back to his Joint Panel. <sep><sep> When Air Mauritius flights were canceled, they became assistants, and declared war against Air Mauritius (Week-End, April 19 and 26, 2009). <sep><sep> During lunch, both avoided talking about anything that could spark controversy. <sep><sep> Are they a worker or are they unemployed? <sep><sep> Arafat Jaradat was arrested 5 days ago, in the town of Sair, near Hebron in the occupied territories. <sep><sep> The launch speech was made by Georges Cheung, editor-in-chief of Life Catholic. <sep><sep> That's when a state bureaucracy, a police and military bureaucracy, will intervene to impose its "law" on it. <sep><sep> When it is not a right, the first person who suffers is the most miserable. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many religious factions often commit atrocities by using violence and imposing their beliefs on others. <sep><sep> We can continue LALIT, even as Chagossians are increasingly moving to Great Britain. <sep><sep> And precisely in The Malaria Man and her neighbors, he believes that other ways of describing the realities of everyday life and an incredible knowledge. <sep><sep> Last time, the 1929 crisis, he was only 10 years old. <sep><sep> Balram, not knowing why, remembers a furious look crossed seven times before in a marriage. <sep><sep> In the city center, the Palestinian Authority Office was bombed in the 2nd Intifada (starting in October 2000) by a rocket from an Israeli army helicopter. <sep><sep> faced with a weakening and bureaucratizing trade union movement, faced with the repression of the 2new ERA laws. <sep><sep> We want active participation, meaning participation where people agree with our program, they contribute to developing our program, and especially people defend the program. <sep><sep> He also made a call in his Zizman for the dismantling of the corrupt system within the framework of the electoral reform that is coming. <sep><sep> Work, which is the starting point of why life continues, which is essential for life to continue, is extremely important. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Given that these multinational corporations have a monopoly on seed production, they make it illegal to save their seeds (through the WTO), or impossible to save it (because it is a "terminator" seed and does not reproduce); <sep><sep> Today's protests are part of the same solidarity that is developing globally to condemn Israel. <sep><sep> Workers say, their unions say, "Correct, if that's how it is, correct!". <sep><sep> Our way of functioning provides each member the opportunity to acquire knowledge, experience, and develop the necessary trust to carry out all activist work. The commissions have also carried out important work, by size: <sep><sep> To avoid a frank conversation about nostalgia, from time to time Prem would make a joke to make everyone laugh. <sep><sep> When GRC raises the issue of Diego Garcia and Chagos butt (when it is the same), it also weakens its sovereignty as well as the fight against militarism and war, and the fight for the reunification of Mauritius and Sovereignty. <sep><sep> We need to develop a solution globally, not just to come out of the crisis, but to make a global solution possible. <sep><sep> Even the BBC or TV 5, which I dislike, were showing scenes which were totally out of context with the words they were broadcasting at the same time. <sep><sep> So, the merit that was there, we found the NHRC's nature clearer. <sep><sep> When there is an economic crisis as there was in 2012, employer organizations, JEC and MEF, are also affected. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Furthermore, Rama Sithanen, even when he presents his latest budget, he is still perpetuating the legacy of the "last regime". <sep><sep> We should bear in mind that a political party is not just a collection of individuals with a vision of how to change society, how to take power. <sep><sep> Yesterday, I must say that there are two main approaches in the fight against drugs, namely 'demand reduction' and 'supply reduction'. In Mauritius, the fight against drugs has been mainly driven by NGOs. The Goomany Center existed before the creation of the Trust Fund to combat drugs. The government has always been a partner in financially supporting NGOs. We regret only that state institutions have not implemented the necessary direct plan on the drug problem. They have only adopted a 'piece-meal approach'. This plan recommended a primary prevention policy in the fight against licit and illicit drugs in society, but unfortunately it hasn’t come to fruition. Prevention in communities is only being done by a few NGOs. The Goomany Center is very active in drug prevention but with limited resources to cover the country. As for treatment, we must say that it is the government that introduced methadone and it is a major solution for people who take opiates like heroin. But the system for distributing Methadone needs improvement for efficiency. Following up on those on methadone is very important. Social reinsertion policy for drug addicts is also not very successful. Addicts face many difficulties in finding work. They have a criminal record that goes against them. <sep><sep> So, 'Mauritianism' that originated with MMMSP and Lel Gos, as Rada and Kisna explained in their paper on historical debates. <sep><sep> In truth, they were not understanding what was happening. <sep><sep> Furthermore, as complicated as it was, he had finished making another plan: to open a food shop next to the market where his customers would get fresh fish, meat, and vegetables every day. <sep><sep> There were a mix of sketches, music, and imitations that brought laughter. <sep><sep> The government has set up the Hookoomsing Committee that produced "Grafi Armoni", and the government has announced that it will introduce the mother tongue in written form in Education. <sep><sep> Then, at the beginning of the 20th century, we began to face a challenge with the power sharing between the colonial administration and what were called the Oligarchs, meaning the large landowners, the large plantation owners. <sep><sep> There is a political struggle needed to propose a socialist alternative economy in favor of all workers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Where we hear all kinds of health in the media talking about nationalism and Mauritianism. <sep> <sep> If we decide to go ahead and put 3 crosses then wait at home, we will not go out. <sep> <sep> And finally, when analyzing this phenomenon of bureaucratization in the trade union movement, you realize that at every trade union, every federation, there is a bureaucracy that does not even have the interest of the worker it represents. <sep> <sep> We had a meeting at FTSP with Prof. <sep> <sep> Does he not realize that in College, students who can pay should pay? <sep> <sep> Since Lindsey Collen was appointed on the 9th of November, 2004, he was constantly in the District court. <sep> <sep> We have made a lot of effort to maintain an internationalist orientation. <sep> <sep> If there was an easy solution, it wouldn't take 40 years. <sep> <sep> In addition to the central government had started blocking the projects of the mini-municipalities. <sep> <sep> Alain Ahvee explained on the different philosophical currents in history that have come from politics and political parties from Aristotle to Karl Marx. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the question of 'Forom du peuple', the union leaders are asking "What is this?" To do Work in Beau Bassin, eleven resolutions were passed by the people. <sep><sep> However, we believe it will succeed (Indeed, it has been a success). <sep><sep> Today, on Friday 25th October, it is my forty-sixth day of olive picking in Palestine. <sep><sep> When it comes to equality, Mike Cole is talking about equality in a sense that is not specified in the content of education or in its form, without discrimination based on sex, racial or communal basis, sexual orientation basis, or religious basis, especially not on a class basis. <sep><sep> This SART has made a public appearance at a press conference held at the Workers' Education center, GRNW, on Wednesday, the 15th of Ziyet. <sep><sep> There was an important speech made during the Vigil in favor of the people of Gaza during the airstrikes period of the "state of siege". <sep><sep> Minister of Justice, Rama Valayden, and Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, Ziz Seetulsing, have taken a position in favor of reintroducing the parole system. <sep><sep> He will be voting on a resolution at his meeting on Friday. <sep><sep> This superpower that the Minister of Labor of the PS is being given by this bill opens up the possibility of blackmail where PS may feel threatened that if the employee does not accept a 'settlement', it will not be taken to court. <sep><sep> When Rayot and SMF were attacking protesters showing support during the Strike at the Garden Company, and when people were being beaten, running away, they turned upside down, some behind the other. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Pensions should be considered as a different form of work payment. <sep><sep> The llama is a creature, it has a moment where it will commit itself. <sep><sep> His father found that he was a parent who was glad to spend his time. <sep><sep> So this led to a tendency to return to our GWF roots. <sep><sep> So, during 2012, we have better understood our political strategy. <sep><sep> But, what we have done, from 1999, there was enough consciousness-raising and mobilization, for some sanctions to be imposed, which we have got. <sep><sep> So, the working class, not just Mauritius, but the whole world, has suffered this process, and the whole world, we are somewhat in the same position. <sep><sep> all local and international organisations with whom we have cooperated and who supported our work. <sep><sep> We do not want the family to be organized like a pyramid with a boss on top. <sep><sep> During the marginalization campaign, political forces that are not within these two blocks. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Since 1971, Berenger has been seeking to form an alliance with the Labour Party and since 1971, Paul Berenger has been fighting the Labour Party.
<sep><sep> We wrote a letter to the Electoral Commission, and after that, the President responded.
<sep><sep> The United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) has given 6 months from 31 August 2012 for the Mauritian State to explain.
<sep><sep> I have a question: "We have just found out that the Mauritian Government is refusing Greenpeace entry into our waters because they allegedly support the Marine Park while there is a military base in Chagos.
<sep><sep> On Friday, 22 August, Lalit held a meeting in Cassis on alternative economic issues to sugar and textiles.
<sep><sep> In the last 3 years before the strike, through the work of Lalit de Klas (distributing copies of the Award in Creole, meetings, rallies), the vanguard has gained great influence in the working class in general.
<sep><sep> We need to be vigilant against absurd constitutional amendments and political alliances to satisfy the leaders in difficulty.
<sep><sep> Timmy found a loophole, seized it quickly on Sunday's envelope, and they were off.
<sep><sep> During leisure time, each delegate chooses which group interests them for a work session - family group, youth, human rights, education, peace, farming, healthcare workers, religion, sports.
<sep><sep> Then, when you meet the criteria to call for a truce, clearly specified superficies, medical equipment must already be available, it must be less than 3 kilometers from a major hospital.
<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is the first time that the Police Commissioner has acted properly. <sep> Ganga was pressing the enter button to call his secretary. <sep> Antonio Gramsci (3) also introduced new developments in the concept of ideology, with the term 'hegemony'. <sep> They are promising their "support for the establishment and its new fashion industry". <sep> We have meetings every two months with Port Louis (Lizur) and Lenor (and sometimes Lwes together). <sep> The MSM continues to boast about "law and order" like parrots that only repeat talk of human rights to mimic. <sep> So, he destabilizes GWF when necessary, and rebuilds it so that it remains under his control. <sep> and this will lead to the extraction of more important resources. <sep> The reason why the workers have to do this is because they do not have the strength to confront the bourgeoisie in its expansion in a new situation where the old Historic Bloc of unity and discipline had collapsed. <sep> Their grandfather (papa M.A.) said that the soldiers had broken the wooden gate when the gate was not closed properly and that in any case the key was in the lock on the gate. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Several delegates from different sectors integrated together with us in the LDK group. <sep><sep> There are groups such as Ah Teck in construction, in the Gamma Civic concessions. <sep><sep> Within the LALIT, we have had a favorable position towards the police union rights since we became a political party in 1982. <sep><sep> In fact, when we held our Strategy Conference where we addressed the questions of "Morisyanism" and "national unity", there was an organization called Democracy Watch with 5-6 people in it. <sep><sep> Soldiers are posted at every checkpoint, checking IDs of every passerby. <sep><sep> The truth is, on December 19, 2002, there was a meeting at the Social Solidarity Center to finalize all parallel activities. <sep><sep> After some time, the resigning members realized that the reasons for resignation might be somewhat damaging. <sep><sep> Only during electoral periods, or during mobilizations on May 1, or for exceptional political reasons, does the bourgeois party have direct contact with the army through meetings, nocturnal congresses, meetings, and door-to-door campaigns. <sep><sep> a movement that also fights against all forms of discrimination and repressive laws such as POTA and IRA; a movement that seeks to deepen democracy. <sep><sep> A strike movement, it is a process, where over time, there is a strict organizational that pushes them to recapture all the diverging aspects of the strike. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There are no access neither on land, on sea, nor by air. <sep><sep> On its northern and southern sides, the fertile land brought about agricultural development that was feeding a population not strongly believing in family planning. <sep><sep> When the monsoon was delayed they had received a few chances besides. <sep><sep> Many IRS projects have been abandoned, what remains underway is facing difficulties in finding a cleaner. <sep><sep> It is a pioneering program existing like a creature in the nature, in the history of society. <sep><sep> While we are facing actions and methods, it’s not about "doing more" actions. <sep><sep> He explained that post-modernism can be found in the events of having different narrations in a novel, different perspectives on the same event. <sep><sep> The development of a new constitution, it is an organic matter, where maximum people are involved, during a major upheaval typically in an "up turn" in a revolution. <sep><sep> This expansion by hectares has been carried out through a program of derocking, Irrigation program, and a program of re-grouping tree plantations. <sep><sep> Lennon had accounted for this movement because the Indian State was fearing that it would strengthen the overall economy in the Bengal region which is in Lennon. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> You can ask the United Nations why the British and their allies are always present on Diego Garcia, if it is dangerous. <sep><sep> Yes, they got what they asked for here in their plant, meaning they cannot be disqualified as candidates in general elections. <sep><sep> Then we invited members and even the public, if they want a copy, make a request, they can get a copy with us. <sep><sep> Sometimes you don't understand why and sometimes you understand very well why, because it is a way of putting sticks in the wheels of the women's movement when it mobilizes to demand real freedom for women and equality. <sep><sep> Now, Mauritius has entered, has told everyone who wants to go to Mauritius to board this boat. <sep><sep> We must recognize that the members of the board used to uphold Ganga's values. <sep><sep> People in the countryside call it Loryann and no one seems to have a problem with him. <sep><sep> Also, we propose at least 20 deputies elected by Proportional Representation by party. <sep><sep> There is no political alternative, on no point of the programmatic. <sep><sep> (Laughter.) So a government braves these pressures, from the IMF, World Bank, WTO. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Systemic crisis is starting to affect people in an unprecedented way. <sep> <sep> So, how do we come out in this “reality” which tells us that the dominant class ideology dominates the entire society, even those who dominate, even ourselves? <sep> <sep> It is in our land, in our sea, in our earth. <sep> <sep> if me, Ragini Kistnasamy, and Chagossian comrades have been released by RIOT on La Chaussee, making RIOT save in the street La Chaussee, (there are many people who remember this). <sep> <sep> And, Minister Bunwaree should not sit in mansions pretending that LALIT is saying that we should use the maternal language exclusively to learn other languages. <sep> <sep> There are too many difficulties with flawed balls for people to pass and present ID. <sep> <sep> Now we are finding a transparent subterfuge by the government to set up a committee to look into the despair of the small villages. <sep> <sep> Ecuador had serious economic problems, went through a severe crisis during the Latin American crisis wave. <sep> <sep> While we are lighting the torch, each delegate is saying "Okay!" Another one say "Okay!" When from the sea, there was a slightly weak area, Tikoli. <sep> <sep> Tsunami has been reorienting itself on the fragility of environmental fragility of the small island states. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> People have been talking about the whereabouts of the boss, during this time, he created a smokescreen, then he brought workers from different countries, and Mauritian workers went to work in other countries, too. <sep> <sep> Let me tell you again, the Prime Minister has just returned from London. <sep> <sep> So, the ideology and politics of the "Historical Bloc" has become "immoral" and even "illegal" in the post-WTO era. <sep> <sep> And this political process has made us realize that there are certain demands that have led us into a deadlock. <sep> <sep> For Mauritius, it wants to give protection to other capitalists, so that the oligarchy does not keep its monopolies and oligopolies. <sep> <sep> Let me explain the concept of "balance of power" or "balance of forces", as it is crucial to understand this issue, and also to understand the quality of the politics that we are leading in LALIT. <sep> <sep> If we continue with the same policies, even when we have formally informed you of your mistake. <sep> <sep> Then, facing a serious threat of dismissal, in GWF, on Sunday the 19th, a decision was taken to trigger the strike action. <sep> <sep> After the arrest of Timi, there was a brief lull during which he was in the community movement, which he was in the Timi-Balram family business. <sep> <sep> And everyone said that the people in Lesid were glad because they were promised that they would have a job once the hotel they work for loses its place, but they will likely get employment. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We need to work together, with our minds and imaginations married to our actions, to overthrow this undemocratic power, this remaining enslavement. <sep> You could say, "But the car has a precious material inside, this also determines its value," but the precious material, it too, its price is determined by its value, and its value depends on the amount of work to extract and bring it here. <sep> He used to attend once a week, twice a week, one full week. <sep> They were in the demonstration against the mirage in 2004 when Alain (for Lalit) was in Lamars Against Miray Jenin-Jerusalem. <sep> He claims to live in a time where his family can support him independently. <sep> Recently, he has been brutally attacked by newspaper journalists for exposing this underworld. <sep> They explain his actions for everyone. <sep> It is also necessary to recognize that their number was played in their favor. <sep> SOFRES 2009 survey showed that, despite the public not frequently acknowledging the existence of any Creole dictionary, rarely acknowledging the extraordinary work that Prevok Bec has done in Creole language, rarely acknowledging the existence of Creole courses in universities, rarely acknowledging the harmony of writing, despite the absence of all this knowledge on the threat to the Creole language, thousands of people continue to use Creole in schools. <sep> He is talking nonsense when the stock of food is low, and serving society to become "private property". <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This will possibly help us understand with more precision the degree of combative class worker, especially the capacity of workers to face the ascending bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> Since its childhood, an immense glass pane, it had a panoramic view of Gondwana basin. <sep><sep> A beautiful ray of sunlight filtering into the large bourgeoisie through photovoltaic, even if it were 80 arpan in size. <sep><sep> However, the class struggle today that the workers bring is quite different from the class struggle that the bourgeoisie was leading in the era where, it was a revolutionary class. <sep><sep> International backdoor agreements and the interests of economic powers are using Israel as a policeman to protect the interests of the big multinational military companies in the Middle East and its oil. <sep><sep> He says that it was different from what he expected because everything he heard in the media made it seem like people were dying in Cuba, the conditions needed to be well-defined in Venezuela and Cuba, with no freedom, with dictatorship, with severe poverty. <sep><sep> Will there be 2 types of laws in this country? <sep><sep> Where we need to develop forcibly, on your own platform. <sep><sep> An American, for example, can start a company here in Offshore Mauritius, then he can choose tax in London or here. <sep><sep> On the other hand, a developing country must strengthen the most progressive sectors in the state, very often. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> During the commemoration of the 1891 massacre in the town of Fourmie in France, where the government ordered to shoot at protesters, like in Chicago. <sep><sep> Jamouna in the company of his mother, aunt, cousins and relatives used to grow up according to customs and traditions. <sep><sep> Pravind Jugnauth himself, he ventured into active politics in the '90s, by joining the MSM party in the Rose-Belle region. <sep><sep> And so, he is doing it step by step. <sep><sep> A company or consortium takes on the provision of services that the public sector used to offer, or takes over its administration for a period of time. <sep><sep> This will not change just because there is a "cover-up" and glorification of Prem Raddhoa by a series of politicians including the Prime Minister and by certain media sections like Radio Plus and MBC. <sep><sep> It, his mission and them watching their backs in Sitronela. <sep><sep> There is pressure from the bourgeoisie to eliminate annual wage compensation. <sep><sep> They were preaching the concept of "class unity", and strategies to serve class unity as a trigger for socialism. <sep><sep> So, where you can have 200-300 delegates present, when there is a debate, when there is a discussion, then decisions that continue the strike are being made. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There is another new phenomenon, thirdly, which we need to carefully guard against, which is delocalization. <sep> Because there are 5 unions, 3 sat 2 lisien, there is a conflict between them, so the only thing where they come to an agreement is what? <sep> Already in this we find a first problem, because among the 'Mauritianists', that is, the 'Mauritians' who simply call themselves Mauritianist. <sep> And when we follow these fractures with others, traversing the alleys of these ideological seisms at the size level, we arrive at the strict ideological enterprise. <sep> What he describes as "the space of the youth." However, the decision to stop the youth Lalit group was taken in the central committee on May 29, as Ashok Subron raised no objection. <sep> It may be mentioned here that a 4th power is the power of these formal and informal militant organizations in depth in Palestine, that are organizing life around the villages to survive the occupation and to build hope to look to the future. <sep> Present in the press conference were Alain Ah-Vee, Veena Dholah, Rajni Lallah, Ram Seegobin and Ashok Subron. <sep> Besides they were doing economy because they believed that one day, one day they would return to Ganga Valley with a treasure to end their lives in peace. <sep> The course content will cover topics such as, definition and origin of creole language, strict grammatical, literary development in creole language, and graphic development. <sep> Is he considered as the manager of Commercial Bank and the boss of La Sentinelle as a progressive boss. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> We all know that nothing ever changes. <sep> This is embodied by LALIT's program for an alternative economy and its program for socialism that is consciously built by the working class. <sep> So much so that they made a blackout on Lalit that Ram Seegobin had to refuse an interview 2 weeks later in News on Sunday - because the newspaper didn't even mention Lalit in the elections. <sep> You don't need to be told!  When Bandouk had meaning to talk and people were forced to listen to his language quickly, the graffiti was taken with chalk instead of ink. <sep> An economic policy that seeks to lift the burden of crisis off the backs of workers and marginalized people, an economic policy that doesn't take into account the basic needs of people. <sep> September 1976" Later on, he went on to compose exams together with a dozen 12-year-old children. <sep> This article provides more details on the strongest moments in Lalit's struggles in Chagos, especially the Chagos families. <sep> The PT policy is to promote the creation of small and medium enterprises in as many possible sectors. <sep> For this occasion, the Favory Group will play "BEF". <sep> We demand a minimum wage debate, indexed, and security for all. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The family organization here received reports that recently the immigration control at the checkpoint in Israel was being strictly monitored. <sep>
<sep> The capitalists themselves, they are too small a class (in terms of numbers, in terms of quantity) to rule by force only their own class. <sep>
<sep> It is entering a crisis that may never end. <sep>
<sep> This State we are talking about is not just the Government. <sep>
<sep> Kamini was seen that Martin King will do a good job. <sep>
<sep> On the contrary, he has reinstated village elections (it was a large LALIT campaign, and we all know it), and he has reinstated old age pensions as a right (this too was a major LALIT campaign and we all know it). <sep>
<sep> Throughout the years, but especially in the last year, there have been significant problems in the real estate market. <sep>
<sep> Gradually, they promoted and developed ICT, with a Cybercity, with its Call Centers and BPO (Business Processing Outsourcing), but this has created very few jobs. <sep>
<sep> Otherwise, it will be quickly overturned by international capitalist force. <sep>
<sep> Now, a clarification, the class struggle has not completely disappeared. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Rada Kistnasamy, in her show Dorizon on the 31st of July, gave an overview of the economic crisis unfolding behind the current political crisis in Mauritius, when 6 ministers resigned. <sep> At the same time, they are asking Hurnam to take a stand in parliament, in their meeting they are preparing to explain any sanctions that the MMM could take against Hurnam. <sep> And then, one year later, there was a big wave of protests, the Septam 80, where a true insurrection forced the government and employers to respect the majority of the elements in the workforce. <sep> How funny! his spoiled little brother, who used to hate math, who loved drawing and music, ended up becoming a manager. <sep> There must be power to determine economic development and social environment. <sep> The high profit figures from large companies in the tourism area were particularly impressive. <sep> - but, in fact, we all imprison this dominant ideology. <sep> Therefore children learn languages that school shows disrespect for their mother tongue and this represents linguistic genocide, because it is a work that removes a child from a group (Creole-speaking or Bhojpuri-speaking linguistic group). <sep> Before that same evening, KLib aired "The Monocled Mutineer" (Part 2). <sep> He said that this Laliberte Lamars, is protesting against the mirror that the State of Israel has, is using and will build. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> How can we intervene in a more effective way in the classroom situation that is unfolding. <sep>
<sep> They have no intention of working, they have no intention of following the open-ended and unionist path that we bring. <sep>
<sep> Surely, someone will ask the question "What role can peace play in schools?". <sep>
<sep> Ram Seegobin also said "according to us, the way reality has unfolded; making economic and social problems invisible. <sep>
<sep> No one remembered that there was a beautiful house like this. <sep>
<sep> With the proposal of the European Union for a drastic cut in securitization prices, the new government is continuing the same policy as the previous regime: that is, continuing the lobby to safeguard the security industry. <sep>
<sep> And finally, the Palestinian Authority has come before the UN General Assembly and the Security Council for its place in the UN. <sep>
<sep> There are conflicts between workers' interests and employer interests, it is a perpetual conflict that goes on, meaning it is not a new thing. <sep>
<sep> Even the SILU-UASI, which has had its membership reduced by half, is now taking a strong position in favor of agricultural diversification as an economic alternative. <sep>
<sep> Its program is different in the sense that it has been persistent. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> When MLF was born, between 1976 and 1977, we spent a lot of time reading to understand what a family organization was, what kind of organization we would be, and how we would need to deal with political parties in general. <sep><sep> With the Euro crisis, Air Mauritius was in crisis too: fewer passengers at first, but also the return rate decreased between Rupees, because tourists from Europe were paying for their plane tickets in Euros. <sep><sep> This means that businesses, companies will make more profit because they will pay less tax. <sep><sep> What is very important is that we also have a way of looking at things, we have a message that we are telling our members. <sep><sep> Movements in large conferences in Mexico, in Mumbai, in London, in Porto Alegre, in Brazil. <sep><sep> The gathering marks, 'Meeting of the FSM Last Sunday'. <sep><sep> He should not forget that he has started to act for the hotelier outside. <sep><sep> He is sure to do what the Social Alliance has been trying hard to do with the PT-MMM alliance. <sep><sep> In his mind of misery, he even made a plan to kidnap the woman, lock her up in a fortress so that he could use her whenever he needed a miracle to make his business work. <sep><sep> And the spokesman, negotiator, advisor, educator, Subron. Destruction is over, total minimization. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Many people are living in prosperity and freedom, what could go wrong? <sep><sep> Transport workers must deal with other more general problems that affect all workers: the new labor law that makes Sunday a normal working day, overtime that is only calculated from 90 hours for a twelfth, the trend towards work on contracts, home. <sep><sep> Therefore, the price of our pleasure, our property, our food has increased as everyone has noticed. He said that Mauritius has the potential to produce this quality of food. <sep><sep> They will have to pay for every day, for their happiness. <sep><sep> The fact that the British Government (vis-a-vis the Commonwealth country) and the USA do not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court, does not mean that it is not important to have such a case. <sep><sep> The government needs to organize insurance for vegetable and fruit plantations as it does for sugar cane. <sep><sep> What happens is that once it "takes power", the sense of power in the State, it bites and goes to another place. <sep><sep> Where will the family meal go to come out in 3 months from now, that is food security. <sep><sep> Is this visit the beginning of a 'remake' of what happened in 1965? <sep><sep> The Labor Party will protest against the conditions of detention in Israeli prisons. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Regarding political, economic and social issues, problems such as agricultural land misuse and environmental damage, fraud and massive corruption in big companies. <sep><sep> This was leading Samy to open his new organic food store and market. <sep><sep> and then we faced the Euro crisis, a global economic crisis. <sep><sep> personally, Ramgoolam said he wouldn't clean up the mess that the Mauritian government made. <sep><sep> pressuring institutions that have a social imbalance where a minority exploit a majority, while supporting organizations that want to reverse such a situation. <sep><sep> Nann didn't have any problems but Fatma's reputation was hurt by her parents' hostility, due to the intolerance of religious leaders who made Nann appear to be Muslim. <sep><sep> What we need to do is create unity among the working class. <sep><sep> And within that, the working class can become the leading class in society, through its capabilities, and after a revolution, can absorb all other old classes into the light. <sep><sep> A new way of thinking about work and understanding the limitations of the current system, discussing how to develop this path and how to bring worker cooperation over time. <sep><sep> and on the basic principles of "We will look further". <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, Musharaf (president of Pakistan) himself was known to have ties to an extremist organization, unable to oppose the strong presence of extremists in control in Pakistan, they were endorsing Taliban fighters. <sep>

<sep> When the leader eventually became public, one of the organizers within, Noor Adam Essack. <sep>

<sep> R: Ram Seegobin: I think it is a good question, especially in the context that it is a term that we frequently use, everyone has their own definition. <sep>

<sep> 6 I will give 2 examples of democracy and freedom in well-advanced work, one in England and one in Mauritius. <sep>

<sep> The second session of Political Philosophy this year was conducted by Ram Seegobin on 2nd December, and chaired by Yann. <sep>

<sep> He will need to solve a series of political crises, one after another. <sep>

<sep> So with the signature of a Minister, one can get Rs200 million. <sep>

<sep> They have abandoned their homes and their culture (“culture” in its broader sense), and here they are experiencing overt exploitation, where employers do not want to pay when workers are absent to take a child to the hospital, when a worker goes to fetch a lamp or buy groceries. <sep>

<sep> They emphatically say we must not question the Best Loser System, and at the same time, they also say that candidates should allow communities on their Nomination Paper. <sep>

<sep> But in reality, it is the labor unions that are not equipping themselves for this important leadership role in the social movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then many people who are in the Zwie religion come to pray at Jacob's tomb. <sep> <sep> And we need to continue to put pressure in our program to free Palestine, which was the basis of our Vigil on the 29th. <sep> <sep> Can Navin Ramgoolam absorb his people as he has already done before? <sep> <sep> But Diego is scanning another thing besides booting Paloma, a pirte in it that he has never found in his aristocratic world of Mexico or Europe. <sep> <sep> Those who knew what their demands were, and they seemed ready to strike over those demands. <sep> <sep> LALIT has been doing all this for a long time: To stand up in the Friday elections to contribute to strengthen this movement which is today a historical necessity. <sep> <sep> Prathna does not know why, this has never happened in the Samazeste office. <sep> <sep> This laliyn LALIT, rational and anti-repressive laliyn has become hegemonic. <sep> <sep> On the contrary, GRC was accommodating the base and looking for advantages from the base, for a while. <sep> <sep> He thought workers had become Palmir section workers, but in fact, Lamek section workers never arrived. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In any figure of speech, the next census is only projected for the year 2021, meaning there will be at least 2 General Elections beforehand. <sep><sep> In the play, a curtain was removed to allow the show to proceed. <sep><sep> The government is preventing the use of Bhojpuri and Creole from becoming official languages. <sep><sep> Subron then used his influence over other executive members of the GWF to expel SILU. <sep><sep> It relies on the absorption of Oriental esoteric philosophy, already considered as one, and as one that is eternally unrewarded. <sep><sep> Here is a transcript of an excerpt given by Lindsey Collen to the LALIT Central Committee last Sunday. <sep><sep> • Repression through antidemocratic bullets preventing people from freely standing as candidates (repression criteria based on language, literacy, employment contracts making it difficult for people to freely stand as candidates). <sep><sep> but their level of English (which is their second language) was higher than the first group and their progress continued. Graphs are attached. <sep><sep> Especially, we are putting our documentation in electronic form. <sep><sep> In ‘Truck’, there are sounds associated with a large vehicle transporting material, and in ‘Three little Bengali’, the sounds are directly placed on long and short vowels. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> However, what is truly striking in the International Conference of Small Island Developing States is the absence of any mention of the development model that has been inherited since colonial times. <sep><sep> We also say that we need to develop the fishing industry and fish processing since we have a large surface area of sea around us. <sep><sep> Since our film club started, we have found 3 new cinemas. <sep><sep> Diego Garcia is an important part of Mauritius, an important part of the Republic of Mauritius, an important part in the collective consciousness of Mauritians. <sep><sep> And above all, where comrade Ram, under the name LALIT, has debated with the direct capitalist representative - a debate with Jean Li, and Mr. <sep><sep> One day, the husband died in an accident. <sep><sep> All of this to describe a working method, and Jack Bizlall and Ashok Subron. <sep><sep> But there has been no mobilization of workers on the work site, there has been no organization of mass petitions, or given workers the opportunity to actively participate in combating these 2 laws. <sep><sep> nourished in deep generosity, like one incapable of committing a crime. <sep><sep> The public is more interested in whether they are raising questions about the program that Lalit is defending. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Xavier Duval and Minister Lasante are in discussions regarding the position of WHO chief. <sep><sep> One of our members, Rajni Lallah, gave a speech in front of almost the entire union movement delegation (800 workers) in the first assembly of the new Trade Union Council. <sep><sep> We all have to pass through - present passports and IDs. <sep><sep> One of his great dangers is preventing access to the beach and blocking free movement to fish. <sep><sep> MSM candidate, Soodhun confirmed the role of President of the Republic in the formation of the Blue-White-Red alliance. <sep><sep> Once they leave the first gate, the big gate that only opens with a key is still closed. <sep><sep> They are very powerful and religious institutions and sometimes these institutions really dominate it and sometimes, it is evident, not only do they dominate it but they are also political authorities themselves. <sep><sep> With great simplicity, we know how Korperativ Laferm has succeeded in transforming pink clay soil into carrot and legume growing fields and organizing their own distribution and washing. <sep><sep> We work in the union to convince members and delegates of the importance of the LALIT program for the working class in general, and to recruit more advanced workers in LALIT. <sep><sep> After the general elections of 2005, the Social Alliance formed a government with 38 deputies and 4 senators, that is 42 seats in all. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The oligarchy (capitalist since the time of slavery, colonization, forced labor) that MMM has come to represent, and Guimbeau and PMSD certainly represent. <sep>
<sep> So, a Marxist economist, studies the concept of "ecology" within the framework of "economics". Marx was one of the first great ecologists. <sep>
<sep> Due to the overwhelming spirit, in the distant past a prophet was forced to be born in the East, in the filthy gutter. <sep>
<sep> Angro, Prime Minister and Cabinet are standing on the brink of collapsing their Party. <sep>
<sep> Our 4 demands on which we are building our mobilization are still very much alive, and it has become easier for it to become national now, as the issue of "economy" is already on the agenda. <sep>
<sep> Some have gone to where they come from, some in those abandoned houses, then the thunder returns to the Water Tower. <sep>
<sep> We have been working on this by writing articles on our main website primarily, and occasionally for the newspaper, when possible. <sep>
<sep> That is, we offer a subjective contribution to this objective movement that is already taking place and emerging together. <sep>
<sep> All this, I understand very well, it is not an utopia, nor a dream, beyond the maze of human history that has passed by without a state and in anarchy. <sep>
<sep> and they are preparing repression to face the social crisis that will follow. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Can the government allow private sectors to donate land for free to billionaires outside the IRS process?
<sep> Initially, the Government allowed one after another farm to close, without compelling the owner to invest in a new form of agro-industry.
<sep> This created a dynamic of diverse branches of Lalit, which went to watch two films on Palestine, on Roshi, on Rivyer Noir.
<sep> As she was about to release the lady on Sunday, that lady could have, when she was free, gave her a little stroke.
<sep> F.M. speaks about Women for Life (a social organization aimed at addressing issues at the grassroots level), Women against the Wall (more political and direct action).
<sep> * This morning, D. and I went to meet F.M. in the village of Kifl Hares.
<sep> So, it is possible that the MMM accepts a “junior partner” in an arrangement, including in a coalition.
<sep> Until almost all the lamps in the security industry are becoming seasoned and casual, and less bright than they used to be.
<sep> Many ask us "What does LALIT think about the strange wave of strikes that recently hit?"
<sep> His arrogance is so great that the GWF cannot stand with him. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then, to show the existence of AWC as a way forward for them, they need to reject it. <sep> It does not address the crisis of gravity, MMM, and it does not propose any way to allow workers to get out of this crisis. <sep> It is necessary to release the electoral process to establish a democratic government and democratically decide on the name of the State; <sep> G. Duval strongly defended what he called 'sons of the soil', meaning people who left Mauritius between 1967 and 1973 and settled in England, France, Australia, Canada, South Africa. <sep> Our current strength lies in the fact that recent events have made it easier for people to understand our analysis of how historical bourgeois/bourgeois state operations differ, but in relation to the working class, this does not make a difference. <sep> So we have to be smarter to know what they are trying to buy us, with the imaginary technological solutions, when in fact all scientists are saying it is meaningless. <sep> When DWC staff do not get a good 'package', MMM can walk with union leaders without losing capitalist support. <sep> We need to recruit new members, our branches need to be more active, our regions more active, our commissions more active, our income more distributed. <sep> Finally, others are saying to bring a case to the ICJ (International Court of Justice) as LALIT has been saying for a long time. <sep> Cindy Clelie concluded by saying that Lalit had 14 candidate families among 32 candidates. <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sometimes I ask myself if these three little pirates can control great powers? <sep><sep> There was nothing for establishing Sunday. <sep><sep> The court will fix the Case on April 29th, after advice from Legal Ram Seegobin and Lindsey Collen for a suitable date. <sep><sep> One thinks he was among them, meaning one can justify the capitalist system, it was Malthus. <sep><sep> Intellectuals like an artist had started causing ecological disorders turning botanical gardens and at the same time hardened like fragile glass that had houses in the wild; <sep><sep> A not-so-good morning a little boy entered his life as a reward for his devotion. <sep><sep> we have published a magazine, poster, leaflets, invitations, timetables, articles, dairies, tracks, flyers in Creole. <sep><sep> But already starting in 1995, with the formation of the WTO and the implementation of new regulations for international trade. <sep><sep> Bunwaree is trying to make workers believe that with his Bill, they can get up to 6 months of severance pay, when it is just an illusion. <sep><sep> Our parents, adoptive grandparents, or biological ones, would be happy to know if there will be work for our children; <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> where there are barriers and checkpoints where the army prevents people from crossing, they help residents in the action of crossing the barrier. <sep><sep> But once they are in Parliament, they are in government, they apply their policies in favor of the bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> they put Zidisyer in a position where he has to make the State issue a Rs 50 million mandate, give it to Sun Trust, a family trust for the Jugnauths, who are the President of the Republic and Minister of Finance. <sep><sep> When Aziz says that he has made a huge mistake, he tells his husband that he doesn't believe it's necessary for the moment. <sep><sep> In the 2005 Ziyet election, the leader of the MSM, Pravind Jugnauth, as we said, was not elected and has been out of Parliament for more than 3 years. <sep><sep> Until now, there doesn't seem to be much preparation for such an action. <sep><sep> In LALIT we are really confronting bourgeois politics, we are questioning the logic of its economic system. <sep><sep> You know, political parties, they rarely think about what they are. <sep><sep> Nita Deerpalsing replied: 'Over my dead body!' 6 months have passed. <sep><sep> Where is Marx, if you are a beginner, it's worth reading one of his works when he was young (like the Communist Manifesto, there is a Creole version in serialized form in Lalit de Klas). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is how a worker controls his work site - by taking into account the work environment, making it better and safer; <sep> <sep> One day, for no reason, on their second wedding anniversary, Aziza tells Aziz that she wants a baby now. <sep> <sep> They ask for a salary of 300,000 to 400,000 per year on the US market. <sep> <sep> For example, he may refuse to drop anyone (another client of this lawyer) to get him in. <sep> <sep> A worker alone cannot liberate and more often he may become part of a partisan enterprise benefiting a group to harm another. <sep> <sep> He didn't seem interested in things that usually make normal people delirious. <sep> <sep> Even attempts by establishment owners to move their dirty laundry from this crisis, when they pull capital from Mauritius, they go exploit workers in Mozambique, in the Ivory Coast, in Gabon, that too, often end in total failure. <sep> <sep> When you are voting for Lalit, it is for what you are voting. <sep> <sep> So when negotiating in 1965, the English should not mention any minor issues. <sep> <sep> A struggle for greater equality in education, marches together with a more general struggle to build a society where there is more equality, more freedom. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> As time passed, the popularity of the Movement for New Life (MNL) was growing due to economic growth, the way it was unfolding was enriching social life, causing greater frustration. <sep><sep> A few days later, they were strictly dismantled, then they returned. <sep><sep> 11,000-12,000 visits per month it seems like a means to leave like LALIT. <sep><sep> he is going to try to influence DPP if he wants to. <sep><sep> And that made everyone, workers, pensioners, unemployed very, very miserable. <sep><sep> Then others like Pramila Patten, Jacquette and others, said that other "communities" in the list should be supported. <sep><sep> The Food Security Authority published this year, in favor of a new agricultural policy. <sep><sep> A union has a list of demands while a political party, it has a program that proposes an alternative. <sep><sep> That is another thing! You say it turns to the left, it turns to the right. <sep><sep> After this international conference, the term 'sustainable development' has become popular and is starting to be included in development politics, on paper at least. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In 2011, the European Union imposed conditions before releasing the second installment of the Mezir Dakonpayment aid package which

it is the first ballot of workers without experience who are learning to bring about a class struggle. <sep><sep> The bourgeoisie was very surprised when Sithanen took back his resignation. <sep><sep> The Government has found a Minister (Choonee) and a Member of Parliament (Hurnam) to be firm and clear in their actions. <sep><sep> President Bush announced he will be coming to Mauritius in January 2003. <sep><sep> Today, we find in Mauritius an abandonment of agricultural land, and this is extreme. <sep><sep> So, I will pull a few "Yellow cards" that have already been drawn up in a list of LALIT testimonies. <sep><sep> Eliezer Francois, the former leader of the PMSD party, MAM, the Authentic Mauritian Movement, who is trying to maintain the extreme right wing '100% authentic Mauritian' movement. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> That is to say, looking at quotations from Marx shows point by point the importance of ecology. <sep><sep> So, let's look at his program, and the reality of his program in practice. <sep><sep> This way we can organize a political rally based on a political program that is appropriate to the nature of the crisis and its gravity. <sep><sep> And Minister Bunwaree should not accept those inappropriate examples that ideologues wrongly attribute from other countries. <sep><sep> He has clearly tried to get into a process to dismantle the Best Loser. <sep><sep> On the other hand, in the private sector, the situation is worsening: after Bizlall and Subron have scored NTUC, to go start the Workers' Union Confederation (CSG), now we are finding that this Confederation is trying to paralyze due to the conflict between the two unionists themselves. <sep><sep> This is a bourgeoisie that aligns its economic interests with colonial and imperialist powers. <sep><sep> We also found in its message of the year MMM is proud to promote union movement and land disputes. <sep><sep> Comrade Yannick said that in Venezuela and Cuba, what people call "revolution", it's not just physical things, it's in everything in Venezuela; there is a very high-class conscience, and a vision. <sep><sep> Ultimately, it is all workers and poor people who are paying for record profits. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The Commercial Bank and the State Bank are declaring between 1.5 billion and 2 billion rupees profit this same year. <sep> <sep> Q: How come Lalit is not able to make an electoral breakthrough? <sep> <sep> On the television, it's not just Divi Diego and Paloma, but Paloma and other seasons that also want to grab your attention and keep you glued to the TV. The television becomes a barrier when Paloma innocently tells Diego that he will make him wealthier but at the cost of exceeding his means. <sep> <sep> There is now a demand for socializing home chores that can be socialized (such as cooking, cleaning, etc), and there has been a chance for men to do more chores (this is not about gender movement!). <sep> <sep> So, the government is intervening in a population's natural expression, Bhojpuri and Kreol, and it is making a crime against humanity. <sep> <sep> What is particularly described by Victor Serge is all that is produced by the dictator Stalin, and at the same time, all that he was constructing to oppose it. <sep> <sep> Dayer X.Duval in 1997 was encouraging the government to privatize, he declared “By privatizing, the State will send a good signal”. Will he take more privatization steps in his first budget? <sep> <sep> We also have new contributors to magazines and websites, in Morris and from other countries. <sep> <sep> This brings unique capacity aggregation for the workers, and mobilization of all oppressed classes with the working class. <sep> <sep> Here is what's contributing to provoke political crises today – later we explain. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Today there is a strong opposition, apart from BB-RH. It is a painful sorrow, for the first time, a 3rd party, MMSD that has successfully managed to release one.<sep><sep> To assist with problems that have not yet found resolution, there is another hurdle, such as the flight in the Ros Nwar camp, MITD, a contract for the Identity Card, problems with the results of the regional elections.<sep><sep> Like all members know, Mauritius Telecom has licensed 2 union leaders and Air Mauritius had suspended 2 union leaders.<sep><sep> He was a mouse in the army of Lerwa, Samazeste Dandouksingh Mahaking and he received his corporal stripes because he was a boss in reports, conversation, and steps forward.<sep><sep> And when they announce that, it is what will define what kind of labor law they will be voting for.<sep><sep> The GRC has made it clear that it is not against the military base.<sep><sep> The acquisition of "literacy," different from the natural language of nature, is not natural at all.<sep><sep> They do not suffer from the simulation of a depressive system that is continuously devouring their lives.<sep><sep> Certainly, it is a matter of human dignity, but it is not just that.<sep><sep> His cousin and Sami had gone to the kitchen to prepare a small meal for their surprise guests. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Some say we are mixing music, a proper thing, with improper things. <sep><sep> In fact, he would have loved the radio silence since the time of Mauritius. <sep><sep> We are discussing a policy that goes to strengthen the working class. <sep><sep> Sometimes they make a fuss to increase the seriousness by one grade higher, even a million rupees. <sep><sep> Other realities on which we have brought campaigns and will continue. <sep><sep> And the Bank of Mauritius will be able to go to play outside in the financial markets. <sep><sep> And what Marx and Engels regained credibility. <sep><sep> This is another way to encourage planters to give up their carts. <sep><sep> It is also about energy, the environment, women's liberation, democracy, freedom, education, health, agriculture, languages, pensions, transportation systems, to strengthen the Military base in Mauritius, for an egalitarian Republic, where everyone can live well, for a world where there is no militarism, no imperialism, no dominance. <sep><sep> He has received a little push from the fact that the financial crisis broke out 2 months before election day. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> On the evening of the 11th, Samazeste and his band were on stage. <sep><sep>With such manipulation at hand, it only serves to strengthen Ashok Subron's position in the GWF. <sep><sep> A strike was had, with the ACIM regaining its Rs650,000 <sep><sep> The Chagos plight is returning to the forefront of Mauritian politics from the very beginning. <sep><sep> Today, it is also in the Tourism and French Zone sector and the capital relocation front. <sep><sep>We remind you that the Education For Workers received the UNESCO 2004 World Literacy Prize Winner. <sep><sep> In a time of economic crisis, MCB has made a profit of 2 billion rupees. <sep><sep> Today, we observe a new extreme penetration of the USA into Mauritian society, Finans Yes You(th) Can, is a family association. <sep><sep>The leader of the Remake, is Anerood Jugnauth, while his son Pravin Jugnauth of the MSM, is not involved in the Remake. <sep><sep> -Klan Beebeejaun, who also represents the economic interests of BAI in the government, and who is No. 2 in the government.<sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And this is because people attribute their problems to where they stand in society, within the production model. <sep> <sep> Nowadays we often come across people saying, "I think I'll go to Canada." <sep> <sep> So in the Land of the Rising Sun there are peasant associations, small-scale farmers, small-scale fishermen, and 10 million hectares. <sep> <sep> But all sectors have been discussing this issue for several weeks. <sep> <sep> Bornes and Port Louis are based on fairly opaque criteria. <sep> <sep> Females have to go through a procedure before undergoing medical procedures: in the case of Mauritius, procedures must meet all the attached conditions, making it a bureaucratic challenge to obtain one, even if it falls within the 100% category. <sep> <sep> Not all are joining one program, some are joining another. <sep> <sep> Meanwhile, they have launched a press campaign where they challenge the loser best. <sep> <sep> Today, only 3% of employees in the country work in the sugar and textile sectors. <sep> <sep> According to the International Solidarity Movement in Palestine, there are 7,500 political prisoners in Israeli jails. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Then there are 90% of people who are producing, working. <sep><sep> Bérenger says "there shouldn't be a cover-up", but he encourages cover-up. <sep><sep> Finally, the British government finds that this does not correspond to its interests, what happens next? <sep><sep> The working class is not mobilized enough, organized, strong enough to be able to regain control. <sep><sep> A year later, there is a depression, the employer sells a T-shirt at the same price of US$1. <sep><sep> It's absurd because in the Penal Code there is no provision to say that it is `unlawful`. <sep><sep> - SAPSN - all kinds of NGOs, civil society organizations, etc. in Africa and elsewhere. <sep><sep> There were also many links between the Punjabi extremist organization and Taliban members. <sep><sep> Today, when we talk about the bourgeois press, we are not just talking about the newspaper written with its Rivet (Week-End, W.E. Scope, Le Mauricien). <sep><sep> PMSD has taken a stand to say that this debate must be on “rights”, not on “religion”. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In a moment of crisis, they were poorly prepared, the union movement had failed completely. <sep> According to the debate, I understand that it is for noisy communication on mobile phones and people moving in the villages when an alarm goes off in the villages. <sep> The various sectors of Mauritius have gone through a crisis with the end of the preferential trade, especially with the WTO regulations. <sep> We were among the first to study this Report, and we presented our analysis on how inappropriate it is. <sep> Here it's worth stopping a moment to say that all great Marxist theorists. <sep> So Ashok Subron organized for ten people to resign along with him at a time when his personal strategy was about to come up for discussion. <sep> The election results also show that people did not approve of the Medpoint agreement between MSM and MMM. <sep> How does Israel's state colonization policy through its colonies in the West Bank and Jerusalem differ from an annexation policy by the State of Israel? <sep> We believe that the extra-Parliamentary opposition needs to be based on a program, and it is this program that we are presenting today. <sep> But there was a moment when it happened, and it was precisely between 1981 and 1982. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The new committee is supposed to resolve 3 main issues between the government and employers: energy (how much CEB depends on establishments), what they call "equity participation," and the famous 2,000 arpents that employers are refusing to sell to the government. <sep><sep> Now we will analyze at what level an idea such as 'freedom' can shape our lives in a prison-like space. <sep><sep> and also by producing insecticides and herbicides that depend only on that water and where they encourage people to use more herbicides and pesticides. <sep><sep> - Renegotiation of IPP/CEB contracts on the price of the electricity that CEB buys from IPP. <sep><sep> LALIT condemns the Prime Minister's decision to move forward with the introduction of a new identity card system in Mauritius similar to what is in Singapore. <sep><sep> And on this immoral note, I will end this analysis, these narratives, together. <sep><sep> Then, if the USA says that security depends on the fact that the US occupies all of Diego, not just part of it, then you must accept. <sep><sep> They tell him it depends on an elite - political leaders, economic leaders, business magnates. <sep><sep> A group of women who were coordinating the strike, and who were not just striking for their own benefit, agreed to hold this formal meeting when we explained that we needed to work together. <sep><sep> Even small and medium enterprises that had good growth through government incentives were negotiating with 'strategic partners' through Dinesh. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> This is a plan to dismantle the welfare state through VRS1 and VRS2 (Voluntary Retirement Scheme, which forces you to accept if you cannot refuse). <sep> It forgets that inclusivity in this agreement, that the system it believes where the law is supposed to protect everyone equally, is in fact a fiction. <sep> Firstly, ERA which establishes a number of things, there are Awards namely NRB for the private sector and PRB for the public sector, and then there are collective agreements between unions and employers. <sep> The government says that 9 out of 10 people are "homeowners", meaning that they do not pay rent, they do not have a problem with housing rights. <sep> Lindsey Collen studied economics at the London School of Economics. <sep> In turn, the Trava-yis-PMSD-MSM-MMM Government, under constant pressure from the capitalist class, plunged the Mauritian economy even further into its unhealthy dependence on Europe. <sep> She was a journalist we called the "MSPA voice" who has just resigned. <sep> They themselves succeed in starting the conversation with the Minister - Family, then Zenes. <sep> What contribution does trade union solidarity have in the relationship between classes, what we call "class struggle"? <sep> As you may have already found, there may be interpretations, so we can expect some talk in the workshop soon. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In that case, more people will appreciate how small details make a big difference. <sep>
<sep> We found a service passage that works in Hebron in a labank. <sep>
<sep> In 2010, we were already invited to the association and union in a meeting about preparing our proposal in the electoral reform. <sep>
<sep> There are often things that don't seem like they happen often: people fall (Perrette, in the fable 'La laitière et le pot au lait'; Jack, in 'Jack and Jill; and Humpty Dumpty in the eponymous 'nursery rhyme'). <sep>
<sep> The MSM mainly represented the interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, especially in textiles, small businesses, and merchants in China town. <sep>
<sep> He has no intention of looking for a mermaid like that. <sep>
<sep> Did anyone ask if he was finished? Tired? No, he wasn't done, nor tired. <sep>
<sep> A child generally needs about 12 years to learn their first language (Collier 1989 citing McLaughlin 1984). <sep>
<sep> But when we look at our economic system in which all other things function, including workers, people, have reduced, before all else to a merchandise, which is disposable, which is sellable. <sep>
<sep> At the SIDS Conference, when the Government of Mauritius was hoping to be able to protect the vulnerability of small islands to gain concessions for Industrial Security, the European Commissioner for Development rekindled all hope in a Press Conference. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> So, LALIT wishes American working classes great courage in the upcoming years, years where American imperialism is weakening, both economically and militarily. <sep><sep> Yesterday, a LALIT member was in Cairo, participating in the Gaza Freedom March. <sep><sep> This is affecting many different sectors - from fuel to medication, from clothing to electronics. <sep><sep> Unions are pushing for a stricter law that will ensure better distribution in production, changing the current system. <sep><sep> So, the class struggle in LALIT is not just worker against planter. <sep><sep> Only when there is this crime, we hear about how there is theft in hotels, theft that is normally covered up. <sep><sep> It is this kind of corruption that can bring a country like Mauritius into a structural crisis. <sep><sep> You may or may not understand, but they have been denying sovereignity for 2 other fundamental elements. <sep><sep> This is what Minister Sithanen and the private sector are calling a "recovery". <sep><sep> Enemies, enemies of all families, start coming one by one until there are 15 families present. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The common diversion for simple profit that the owning class has been benefiting from since slavery. <sep><sep> * Share tracks, protect traditional tracks - tracks on the theme of identity, and where the LALIT program is also mentioned. <sep><sep> If a citizen says “every person” is not a king, not an aristocrat, not noble, etc., and he says that every person is “equal”, then what remains is that they are all equal among themselves. <sep><sep> It also explains how the movement to strengthen military bases weakens all forms of pro-militarism and warfare and makes movements against warfare permanent. <sep><sep> In the last area we find plans presented side by side. <sep><sep> In the capitalist system, because new technologies are more efficient and use fewer resources, prices are lower, and demand is increasing. <sep><sep> Such an omission from a Finance Minister represents a resignation of a government within its responsibility. <sep><sep> For example, he refused to organize an official visit to Diego, for example, abort the Trochetia. <sep><sep> Alain Ah-Vee, who chaired the press conference, expressed his support for the CMT workers who came out of Lasinn. <sep><sep> At the same time, “tonkin” is not a completely wild village like “fes”. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Children can easily convert their conceptual development from their mother tongue to a second or third language. <sep><sep> Clearly, during the 2005 electoral campaign, the press was implementing a coordinated plan. <sep><sep> Meanwhile, the imperialist legacy of the colonial era still exists (BIOT and Diego), foreign languages continue to dominate the country's language, the economy leans towards Europe, etc. <sep><sep> In the discourse of Bidze, the way they describe the diminished prevalence and diminished Sovereignty of Alawenns. <sep><sep> When it comes to the concept of "class struggle", and could have been in the morning session we had finished understanding how the class struggle rules every day, partly. <sep><sep> At least if you change your name, you call yourself Block 103. <sep><sep> - What happens to you, Gopia? - Not me, it's him. <sep><sep> How will progress be made to export on a large scale, keep the beach clean, ensure a market for small farmers. <sep><sep> So, gentlemen, we no longer use the term "economic crisis" in the same sense as before. <sep><sep> Before 2008, the trade union movement had united on a common platform against the introduction of a new law in favor of employers. For a long time, whether it was the Berenger-Jugnauth government or the Ramgoolam government, employers were supporting the implementation of such a law. But the government could not bring the law because the trade union movement was united on a common platform. In 2008, only when this trade union unity broke, then the government finds an opportunity to introduce new labor laws (ERiA) and new industrial laws (EreA) pro-employer in Parliament and have it voted on. All these laws are regressive compared to the Labor Act and the Industrial Relations Act (IRA). In 2008, when GWF-FPU-FTU left NTUC and formed a new confederation CSG, the government moved forward with its ERiA and EReA. Subsequently, today the CSG seems to have paralyzed due to internal conflicts. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> In the Lepor sector, there was already a problem because Vrak was coming. <sep><sep> Ashok Subron explained that the MSM-MMM agreement and the pwin-de-vi Lalit, are establishing a form of "bicephalization" of political power in Mauritius. <sep><sep> Izrael Mardi said that information he may provide indicates that there is no nerve gas. <sep><sep> This is very likely because Pravin Jugnauth has not been elected. <sep><sep> But this is just a capitalist and union logic that imprisons it. <sep><sep> The only politics that can pose a challenge to the economic system that is bringing corruption, and bringing more inequality. <sep><sep> Not just England and America on “low moral ground”, but the economies of these imperialist countries – America and Europe – are in decline. <sep><sep> So, it shows how a strike can go a long way, become so expensive in a society that it manages to involve a landlady who has kicked out her little boy. <sep><sep> and Noor Adam Essack was targeted, he had downloaded 24,000 terrorist clips, which was supposed to cause a 9/11 attack, but the police intervened because he was not just staring at the Twin Towers. <sep><sep> These are the industrial zones described in the article in Le Monde Diplomatique. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> There must be a general electoral reform and a proportional dose that would allow the revocation of municipal decisions without relying on the communal regrouping of Indian districts. <sep><sep> His voice had returned to him and his throat felt dry. <sep><sep> We, in LPT, want the mother tongue, especially the language of all oppressed people, to be used in schools. <sep><sep> This means that when the time came for enemy-enemy since the existence Best Loser system, it has become less harmful, and today it is more appealing. <sep><sep> and Ram Seegobin, Alain Ah-Vee and Lindsey Collen in No Bases where the World Social Forum in Mumbai 2004, and Lindsey Collen in the first grand conference NO BASES in Ecuador last year. <sep><sep> We find that Grand Bassin event is becoming a platform for Pravind Jugnauth and other MSM leaders to make communal speeches. <sep><sep> The death of Yasser Arafat brought instability to the Palestinian movement. <sep><sep> And it can be through its electoral program, through slogans, action plans like "Economic democratization", it mobilizes people when it finds it necessary to counter the grand bourgeoisie. <sep><sep> So, the economy concerns this big endless struggle, which is continuing with us. <sep><sep> Nadja Rakowitz also works to edit a paper that has been out for 46 years called "Express", which is a workers' paper linked to all trade unions in all sectors (including the Intersindikal Labaz that LALIT activists have organized in Mauritius). <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He came up with a "Historical Block" right next to the river and discussed the weather: he had a big plantation as his main base, little plantations as his subsidiaries, worker union and artisan union (PWU and AGWU) as his main supporters, as well as 3-4 business owners established with him. <sep> <sep> So, this represents a strategy where you are not "eliminating" the worst loser, but rather running after him through a hit-and-run strategy. <sep> <sep> The communication of LALIT with the people living in our society is in Creole. <sep> <sep> Soldiers say that only Palestinians can endure Checkpoint. <sep> <sep> There are several different LALIT members who have contributed their analysis. <sep> <sep> I believe that all these people know that they lack principles. <sep> <sep> We need to eat, we need to live on the land, and produce from the land. <sep> <sep> The crisis between MSM and MMM is not new, but it has accelerated when PMSD entered the government on Monday. <sep> <sep> People don't really realize that, just going to vote and going back home, nothing will ever change. <sep> <sep> Indeed, the kind of difficulties we are experiencing today - that we are experiencing - will help us know what form of class struggle to take under these specific conditions. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The reason for this is that, together with the Zini government, they have plotted and are continuing to carry out this conspiracy to establish and then guard a military base on Earth that will not be of any use to them. <sep><sep> Prime Minister, Honorable Navin Ramgoolam, Opposition Leader Honorable Paul Berenger, who have already spoken in favor of considering the introduction of Creole language in the National Assembly. <sep><sep> We are in a Government where there are 2 parties: PT and MSM. <sep><sep> As for Lenin, his great economic contribution lies in "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism"; but in terms of the revolution itself, his "April Thesis" is also very important. <sep><sep> They decided not to say anything because they didn't want the two children to suffer because of their father’s mistakes. <sep><sep> You can't put it too strongly. <sep><sep> Multinationals like Monsanto, Novartis, Aventis are doing everything they can to have a monopoly on agriculture by controlling its distribution. <sep><sep> This issue has become crucial at a time when we are suffering from malnutrition and rising food prices due to increased demand for food worldwide. <sep><sep> Then the discussion turns to the importance of women organizing at the level of their family and their region. <sep><sep> He even forgot that his cataract-like glasses were blackened. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> Sindika SILU (Sugar Industry Labourers' Union) and UASI (Union of Artisans of the Sugar Industry) were recognized. <sep> <sep> For the Bush administration, profits for multinational corporations take precedence over our land security. <sep> <sep> and allows it to continue to reign in villages when someone has been attacked. <sep> <sep> MMM has successfully avoided saying anything publicly until now. <sep> <sep> In June 2011, There was a bizarre speech by Navin Ramgoolam where he attempted to open the poop pit where he said that his father had made a conscious decision to support the sugar industry through negotiation of quotas and guaranteed prices. <sep> <sep> There were 2-3 of my friends who went crazy and ruined their clean lives. <sep> <sep> He was responding to another person present (not Ram Seegobin nor Lindsey Collen) who said "The police are killing innocents!". <sep> <sep> The bourgeoisie is questioning the principle of minimum wage and NRB. <sep> <sep> The government needs to set an example by providing food to export on his Rose-belle factory! <sep> <sep> Three soldiers and their guns point to him, the violent language the soldiers are using (it's transmitted even though I don't understand Arabic) and the driver controls his vehicle and speaks with the soldiers. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> The MSM-MMM coalition is threatening to attack social and economic rights such as higher pensions and free hospital system. <sep> Mobilization against ERa and ERi, 2 laws against workers and trade unions. <sep> We witness serious crimes, shocking dramas in the newspapers everyday. <sep> Meanwhile, unions like the Plantation Workers Union have been weakened, there are no longer as many cane field laborers. <sep> Following the lessons of the 1979 general strike, there are several lessons that we, as LALIT militants, have learned and pass on. <sep> Comrade Ram: The link between electricity and religion is fascinating. <sep> *Increasing social security benefits, unemployment benefits, and improving free healthcare and education. <sep> It was said that even if all these theories provided certain advances in understanding the world, they all tend to get bogged down in the assumptions that they do not propose any solutions to the problems they expose. <sep> What is most striking is that at the same time Jocelyn Gregoire in 5-Plus (Sunday 26th August 2007) is making a call for a 'wake-up call' among the 'creole' community. <sep> It is not easy to refer to all this, without the risk of creating more instability. <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> He was in LALIT for one year, and during that time, he had this vision laser-focused on how to work. <sep> <sep> He's not trying to solve all the problems, but he will certainly go in the right direction. <sep> <sep> Every candidate must choose one of the 4 "communities" present in a Seat attached to the Constitution of Mauritius: namely Hindu, Muslim, Sino-Mauritian or the General Population. <sep> <sep> LALIT is not there to cover up the shortcomings in the system, this sets LALIT apart from other parties that have an electoralist policy. <sep> <sep> We believe that when a political party is organized democratically, has strict democratic principles, has branches, has members with equal rights within the party. <sep> <sep> Demanding that the State provide pensions to children whose biological fathers have disappeared (this is also not in the family liberation program). <sep> <sep> A trek that used to take 10 minutes this morning cost 3 shekels, now takes 30 minutes and costs 2 shekels twice. <sep> <sep> On a fundamental question, the GRC has already asked for permission and claimed that Chagossians should have priority to work on the base. <sep> <sep> He has worked as an expert for Lasinn, America, China, and Lenn. <sep> <sep> Is the sugar industry, even if its name is changed to the candy industry, does it have a future? <sep> <batch_sep><batch_sep> <sep> And then he could ask and the representatives of the MMM and the Labour Party to distribute the weighty questions, those two bourgeois alliances in the council of the residence council Octave Wiehe where Rajni Lallah had taken the floor. <sep><sep> This means that all the demands had one goal, insofar as its history in its entirety, it was clear and Chagossian and other Mauritians who participated. <sep><sep> Like a bullet, Lalit had fired and hit in November 2001,
